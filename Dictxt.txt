Abnegation
	•	Laissons donc la raison aux philosophes, mais ne lui demandons pas trop d'intervenir dans le gouvernement des hommes. Ce n'est pas avec la raison et c'est le plus souvent malgré elle, que se sont créés des sentiments tels que l'honneur, l'abnégation, la foi religieuse, l'amour de la gloire et de la patrie, qui ont été jusqu'ici les grands ressorts de toutes les civilisations. (Lebon, 1895)
Absence
	•	Absence and presence have very primal effects upon us. Too much presence suffocates; a degree of absence spurs our interest. We are marked by the continual desire to possess what we do not have— the object projected by our fantasies. Learn to create some mystery around you, to use strategic absence to make people desire your return, to want to possess you. Dangle in front of others what they are missing most in life, what they are forbidden to have, and they will go crazy with desire. (Greene, 2018)
Strategic absence
	•	use strategic absence to make people desire your return, to want to possess you. (Greene, 2018)
Absolute safety
	•	Absolute safety is an ideal state of a system where there are no threats to humans and their environment or to the hardware and software parts of the system. (Wells, 1996) 
Adaptable process
	•	A decision process is adaptable if, in response to unexpected events and interventions, it can be easily changed. (Vari, 1995)
	•	Adaptable processes help to reach legitimate decisions that inspire general confidence in their fairness. (Vari, 1995)
Adaptiveness 
Operational adaptiveness
	•	Operational adaptiveness is having flexibility and robustness of forces at a given time: Flexibility to be used in different ways and different pol-mil scenarios; Robustness to assumptions about scenario details (e.g., warning time). (Davis, 2000)
Strategic adaptiveness
	•	Strategic adaptiveness is the ability to change military posture quickly and easily over time in response to shifts of geo-strategic environment or national strategy: Quickly enough to meet challenges; Easily in terms of budget and assured effectiveness. (Davis, 2000)
Adsorption
	•	Adsorption is the adhesion of molecules to surfaces of solid bodies with which they are in contact. (Paustenbach, 2002b)
Acceptability of risk
	•	For a risk to be 'acceptable' on the other hand means that for purposes of life or work, we are prepared to take it pretty well as it is. (Great Britain and Health and Safety Executive, 1992)
	•	The term ‘acceptable’ refers to an activity where the remaining risks are so low that additional efforts for risk reduction are not seen as necessary. (Renn, 2007b)
Acceptable risk
	•	In the case of acceptable risks it should be left to private actors to initiate additional risk reduction or to seek insurance for covering potential but acceptable losses (although this does not eliminate the need for all concerned to have sufficient information and resources to do so). (Renn, 2007b)
Access control
	•	Access controls include any attempt to manage the entry of actors or agents into some domain, for instance, by demanding identification of permitted persons before entry into a building or a password before access to some digital environment. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	As long as the access controls work perfectly, everything inside the perimeter remains not exposed to external threats, even though the perimeter remain exposed. (Newsome, 2013)
Accident
	•	Conventional explanations for accidents use notions such as operator error; faulty design or equipment; lack of attention to safety features; lack of operating experience; inadequately trained personnel; failure to use the most advanced technology; systems that are too big, underfinanced, or poorly run. (Perrow, 1999)
	•	accident is an unintended and untoward event. (Perrow, 1999)
	•	An accident, then, involves some damage to people, objects, or to both. But uncertainties remain. (Perrow, 1999)
	•	the damage to objects or people must be sufficient to disrupt the ongoing "task" or future tasks that will be demanded of the objects or people. (Perrow, 1999)
	•	accident as unintended damage to people or objects that affects the functioning of the system (Perrow, 1999)
	•	An accident, then, involves damage to a defined system that disrupts the ongoing or future output of that system. (Perrow, 1999)
	•	the damage must be reasonably substantial. (Perrow, 1999)
	•	we reserve the term accident for serious matters (Perrow, 1999)
	•	An accident is a failure a subsystem, or the system as a whole, that damages more than one unit and in doing so disrupts the ongoing or future output of the system (Perrow, 1999) 
	•	Accidents involve damage to subsystems or the system as a whole, stopping the intended output or affecting it to the extent that it must be halted promptly. (Perrow, 1999)
	•	Component failure accidents and system accidents are distinguished on the basis of whether any interaction of two or more failures is anticipated, expected, or comprehensible to the persons who designed the system, and those who are adequately trained to operate it. (Perrow, 1999)
	•	It is not the source of the accident that distinguishes the two types, since both start with component failures; it is the presence or not of multiple failures that interact in unanticipated ways. (Perrow, 1999)
	•	Accidents are far less frequent. (Perrow, 1999) 
	•	accidents do not provoke a cultural reevaluation of precautions. Even though accident may result from failure of foresight at the individual level, accidents caused by Individual errors or failures to adhere to a accepted precautions do not provoke reevaluations of cultural defences; nor do even large-scale accidents which occur in situations of recognized hazard and high risk. (Stech, 1979)
	•	Accidents are either explainable within pre-existing cultural context or are foreseeable and predictable to some extent. (Stech, 1979)
	•	Accident, the realization of the imminent, irreducible risk that logistics hopes to contain, and not through control, that the strongest bonds of the polis are formed. (Bratton, 2006)
	•	the accident is also a critical source of solidarity, a binding exception that is the real condition of acceptance. (Bratton, 2006)
	•	An accident includes any undesired circumstances which give rise to ill health or injury, damage to property, plant, products or the environment; production losses or increased liabilities. (Hughes and Ferrett, 2011)
	•	Accidents are unintended events. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Accidents are events, they cannot be reversed, and have time in their likelihood. (Cook, 2008)
	•	The accident is due to some individual fault, imprudence or negligence; it cannot be a rule. (Foucault et al., 1991)
	•	Accidents and conjunctures, and curious juxtapositions of events are the very substance of history. (Feyerabend, 1993)
Risk of accident
	•	Risk is collective. Whereas an accident, as damage, suffering, is always individual, striking at one and not another, a risk of accident affects a population. (Foucault et al., 1991)
Component failure accidents
	•	Component failure accidents involve one or more component failures (part, unit, or subsystem) that are linked in an anticipated sequence. (Perrow, 1999)
	•	The vast majority of component failure accidents involve a series of failures. (Perrow, 1999)
System accidents
	•	System accidents involve the unanticipated interaction of multiple failures. (Perrow, 1999)
	•	A system accident, in our definition, must have multiple failures, and they are likely to be in reasonably independent units or subsystems. (Perrow, 1999)
	•	But system accidents, as with all accidents, start with a component failure, most commonly the failure of a part, say a valve or an operator error. (Perrow, 1999)
	•	The dangerous accidents lie in the system, not in the components (Perrow, 1999)
System breakdown
	•	Systems, moreover, tend to break down when ‘nodes’ in the network (i.e. the elements of the system) are tightly coupled (Homer-Dixon 2006:115−16). (Coker, 2009)
Major accident
	•	A major accident might be defined as one having the potential to kill three or more people or damage a specific area of the environment or cause property damage and loss in excess of a particular sum. (Wells, 1996)
Minor accident
	•	A minor accident might arise when the release of a substance can cause ill health due to the physico-chemical properties of the substance and the way these affect people (Wells, 1996)
	•	Similar lesser incidents occur when people suffer cuts or burns or when a smell or smuts cause nuisance to the public. (Wells, 1996)
Design basis accidents
	•	Certain accidents are known as 'design basis' to signify that the characteristics of the engineered safety systems of the plant will cater for them so that they do not produce unacceptable consequences. The implication is that any release bigger than that involved in a design basis accident could only occur as the result of the sequential failure of several levels of safety protection, or of some major and very unlikely event, such as the failure of the very strong vessel surrounding the reactor core. Such larger releases are called 'beyond design basis' accidents. They could range in size from those bigger than the design basis to verysevere accidents. (Great Britain and Health and Safety Executive, 1992)
Accomodation
	•	accommodation refers to the adjustment which occurs in the existing structure in order to find a place for new elements. (Breakwell, 2014)
Action
	•	When people lose the connection between their actions and their consequences, they lose their hold on reality, and the further this goes the more it looks like madness. (Greene, 2018)
Hurting action
	•	goals are generally inferred from the effects of behavior, and the effects that are best known and often seem most important are the effects upon ourselves. Thus actions that hurt us are commonly interpreted as inten- tional expressions of hostility directed at ourselves. Of course, this will often be an accurate interpretation, but people sometimes fail to recog- nize that actions that seem directed at them are actually the unintended consequence of decisions made for other reasons. (Heuer, 1999)
Activism
Comteporary activism
	•	Today’s activists pose a chal- lenge to the state precisely because networked social action has no neces- sary cause, programme or even purpose. (Coker, 2009)
	•	In contemporary activism, ideas and behaviour can still spread vertically by descent from leaders but it may also spread horizontally by infection. Virtual revolutionary action is networked in a way revolutionary action traditionally wasn’t. (Coker, 2009)
Actor
	•	We humans are consummate actors. We learn at an early age how to get what we want from our parents by putting on certain looks that will elicit sympathy or affection. We learn how to conceal from our parents or siblings exactly what we’re thinking or feeling, to protect ourselves in vulnerable moments. We become good at flattering those whom it is important to win over—popular peers or teachers. We learn how to fit into the group by wearing the same clothes and speaking the same language. As we get older and strive to carve out a career, we learn how to create the proper front in order to be hired and to fit into a group culture. If we become an executive or a professor or a bartender, we must act the part. (Greene, 2018)
Acting
Method acting
	•	In method acting you train yourself to be able to display the proper emotions on command. (Greene, 2018)
Actuarial scientist
	•	[…], actuarial scientists can advise insurer with confidence about the probability of an accident within a certain period and area involving a driver of a certain age, gender, and occupation and with a certain vehicle. (Newsome, 2013)
Accountability
	•	Accountability requires that analysts and managers  understand each other's viewpoints and work together in producing the best analysis they can. (Gates, 1992)
Acquaintance
	•	the friendship evolution function already deals with similarity, and if a neighbour is not similar at all, it will never be more than an acquaintance. (Hassan et al., 2011)
Acute testing
	•	The objectives of acute toxicity testing are to define the intrinsic toxicity of the chemical, to assess the susceptible species, to identify target organs, to provide information for risk assessment after acute exposure to the chemical, and to pro- vide information for the design and selection of dose levels for prolonged studies (Klaassen, 2001; Ballantyne et al, 1999; Hayes, 2001) (Paustenbach, 2002b)
Adaptability
	•	Creativity and adaptability are inseparable. (Greene, 2014)
Adaptation
	•	Adaptation, and the emergence of new kinds of agents, then arises from changes in the relevant boundaries. (Holland, 2014)
	•	Sophisticated agents have another means of adaptation: anticipation (‘lookahead’). IF an agent has a set of rules that simulates part of its world, the nit can run this internal model to examine the outcomes of ifferent action asequences before those actions are executed. (Holland, 2014)
Addiceted
	•	we know the addicts who get out of their addiction, only to fall back in or find some other form of addiction. (Greene, 2018)
Adhesion
	•	Pour éveiller l’intérêt on demanda à une vedette, Kay Smith, d’user de sa popularité pour solliciter les adhésions. (Mannoni, 1985)
Admiration
	•	Oftentimes we choose to admire people who achieve great things, admiration being the opposite of envy. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Admiration is the polar opposite of envy—we are acknowledging people’s achievements, celebrating them, without having to feel insecure. We are admitting their superiority in the arts or sciences or in business without feeling pain from this. But this goes further. In recognizing the greatness of someone, we are celebrating the highest potential of our species. We are experiencing Mitfreude with the best in human nature. We share the pride that comes from any great human achievement. Such admiration elevates us above the pettiness of our day-to-day life and will have calming effect. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Although it is easier to admire without any taint of envy those who are dead, we must try to include at least one living person in our pantheon. (Greene, 2018)
Adversary
	•	adversaries are the people, groups, and organizations that are hostile to the assets. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	Adversaries are also characterized by their history of attacking assets, the intention to attack assets, and the capability and motivation to continue to attack assets. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	Adversaries may be motivated by any number of factors, but the most usual motivations are economic, personal, and ideological. And the most common of these three is economic where the gain of valuables, including money, is the driving force behind a criminal attack. (Vellani, 2007) 
	•	The complexity of both individual and cultural characteristics implies that specific activities-in-context cannot be predicted, even with the benefit of a seemingly exhaustive cultural taxonomy or knowledge of the actor’s culture. (Hoffman et al., 2011)
	•	Rather, knowledge of the actor’s culture and beliefs allows one to appreciate how the actor makes sense of the world, and thus formulate situation dependent tendencies in reasoning and judgment. (Hoffman et al., 2011)
Adversary’s activity
	•	An adversary’s activity does not always make sense, especially if they are culturally different from the sensemaker (sometimes even bounding and identifying the adversary is extremely difficult). (Hoffman et al., 2011)
	•	An adversary’s activities are moderated in significant ways by attitudes, beliefs and emotions, and of course these are sometimes unknowable and often difficult to discern. And it must be kept in mind that people’s activities do not always make sense to them either. (Hoffman et al., 2011)
Adversary’s actions
	•	Understanding an adversary’s actions and decision-making is crucial to successful adaptation. This is not just a matter of canvassing the range of possible actions for a given situation, but rather, a matter of exploring the reasoning of the decision maker to understand how he perceives, how he strategises, and how he makes sense of the world. These cognitive dimensions are deeply interactive with cultural knowledge and influences. (Hoffman et al., 2011)
Adjacency
	•	Simple physical adjacency tends to generate more security interaction among neighbours than among states located in different areas, a point also emphasised by Walt (1987: 276–7). (Buzan and Wæver, 2003)
	•	Adjacency is potent for security because many threats travel more easily over short distances than over long ones. (Buzan and Wæver, 2003)
	•	The general rule that adjacency increases security interaction is much less consistent in the economic sector (Buzan et al. 1998: 95–117). (Buzan and Wæver, 2003)
Adversarial collaborations
	•	I have engaged in a few “adversarial collaborations,” in which scholars who disagree on the science agree to write a jointly authored paper on their differences, and sometimes conduct research together. (Kahneman, 2012)
Adversarial forums
	•	Adversarial forums (such as court cases, committee hearings, planning inquiries) are commonplace in institutional life (cf. Bryson & Crosby 1992) (Hood and Jones, 1996)
Adversary motivation
	•	Adversary motivation and capability are key to understanding the nature of crime on the property. (Vellani, 2007)
Adversity
	•	Although adversity and pain are generally beyond your control, you have the power to determine your response and the fate that comes from that. (Greene, 2018)
Advocacy
	•	“Advocacy is always not only more simple, but more fun, than intelligence assessment,” writes Harold Ford, a former head of the National Intelligence Council. “The latter has to be all-seeing, responsible, free from any taint of being ‘cooked.’ The former can pick, choose, and skew its facts and arguments. This is not a fair fight: advocacy will always look more attractive to a harassed policymaker than will the usually more sober facts of life.” (Betts, 2007)
Affect
	•	According to Merriam-Webster, affect (as a noun) means
the conscious subjective aspect of an emotion considered apart from bodily changes. (Sjöberg, 2006)
	•	Finucane et al. (Finucane et al., 2000) wrote: Affect may be viewed as a feeling state that people experience, such as happiness or sadness. It may also be viewed as a quality (e.g. goodness or badness) associated with a stimulus. (p. 2, emphasis added). (Sjöberg, 2006)
	•	Emotion, feeling and affect are seemingly equated. (Sjöberg, 2006)
Affinities
Apparent affinities
	•	By apparent affinities I mean that symbolic links are created with extant bodies of knowledge, expertise, and experience and that these links makerecognizable that which is unknown or unknowable.' (Clarke, 1999)
	•	To create anapparent affinity between phenomena is to claim that things are alike in essential ways, and that one knows what those essences are. (Clarke, 1999)
	•	So apparent affinities are important tools that organizations can use to solve problems—especially thorny political problems like convincing audiences to accept their definitionsof acceptable risk. (Clarke, 1999)
Aging
	•	Aging has a psychological component and can be a self-fulfilling prophecy—we tell ourselves we are slowing down and cannot do or attempt as much as we did in past, and as we act on these thoughts, we intensify the aging process, which makes us depressed and prone to slow down even more. (Greene, 2018)
Agency Separation
	•	Discussions of the agency's risk assessments have usually focused on its conclusions and their relationship to the agency's regulatory mandate, rather than on its characterization of risk. (National Research Council, 1983)
Intra-Agency Separation 
	•	In this model, risk assessment is performed by a group that is ostensibly separate from and independent of the office responsible for regulation in the same agency. (National Research Council, 1983)
	•	An intra-agency risk assessment unit could be program-specific or agency-wide. (National Research Council, 1983)
Extra-Agency Separation
	•	In this model, an agency's risk assessment is developed outside the agency. (National Research Council, 1983)
Agenda setting
	•	The transfer of issues from the media agenda to the public agenda is a robust media effect in the domains of political communication (e.g., Sheafer & Weimann, 2005) and corporate communication (e.g., Carroll, 2011). (Kleinnijenhuis et al., 2015)
	•	although new media (e.g., blogs, social networks) have enabled the public to express its agenda directly, research results thus far point in the direction of a top–down agenda-setting process in which opinion leaders alter the agenda of their followers in blogs and web forums (Himelboim, 2008; Kiousis et al., 2007; Miller, 2010). (Kleinnijenhuis et al., 2015)
Agent
	•	Agent are parallel processors in the sense that all rules that are satisfied simultaneously in the agent are executed simultaneously. (Holland, 2014)
Sophisticated agents
	•	Sophisticated agents have another means of adaptation: anticipation (‘lookahead’). IF an agent has a set of rules that simulates part of its world, the nit can run this internal model to examine the outcomes of ifferent action asequences before those actions are executed. (Holland, 2014)
Aggregation
	•	Aggregation, he adds, is central to successful decentralization. (Coker, 2009)
Airport
Airport network
	•	the airport network: the personal experience of every frequent traveller shows that direct flights are not that common, and intermediate stops are necessary to reach several destinations; thousands of airports are active, but each city is connected to less than 20 other cities, on average. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
Alert
	•	-Too many tightly prescribed indicators underpinning an alert, and the risk increases that the state of alert will be declared too late. Too few and too loose the indicators, and false alarms must be expected. (Omand, 2014)
False alert
	•	False alerts discredit alarm by highlighting probability of occurrence (which runs counter to unusual behavior such as resort to force) at the expense of severity of consequences.  (Betts, 2007)
Alert system
	•	In the case of counter-terrorism, alert systems exist in most Western countries linked to precautionary or response measures by government, thus reducing the time likely to be taken arguing about what to do on the day and enabling a consistent response to be given. (Omand, 2014)
	•	Given the existence of a set of alert states, it is logical for governments to try to select a number of key indicators of potentially hostile activity that can act as warning geese whose cackle will awaken the guards. (Omand, 2014)
	•	threshold of evidence that would trigger a higher state of alert. (Omand, 2014)

Ally
	•	Be wary of offending with your growing sense of superiority—you will need your allies. (Greene, 2018)
Ambition
	•	To say you’re ambitious in the world today is often to admit to something slightly dirty, perhaps revealing too much self-absorption. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Much of this sneering at ambition and ambitious people in our culture actually stems from a great deal of envy at the accomplishments of others. Tamping down your youthful ambitions is a sign that you don’t like or respect yourself; you no longer believe you deserve to have the power and recognition you once dreamed about. That doesn’t make you more adult, simply more likely to fail—by lowering your ambitions, you limit your possibilities and diminish your energy. In any event, in trying to appear unambitious, you are just as self-absorbed as anyone else; being so humble and saintly is your ambition, and you want to make a display of it. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Some people remain ambitious as they get older, but their ambitions are too vague. They want success, money, and attention. Because of such vagueness, it is hard for them to ever feel they have satisfied their desires. (Greene, 2018)
Analysis
	•	All forms of analysis have the same logic: Decompose complex systems into manageable components and then calculate how they might perform together. (Fischhoff, 2015)
	•	Analyses are always incomplete. They neglect concerns that are hard to quantify. They define terms in ways that serve some interests more than others. They consider some sources of uncertainty but not others. (Fischhoff, 2015)
	•	To use analyses wisely, decision-makers need to know what judgments were made and how they affected the results. (Fischhoff, 2015)
	•	Analysis is not a science, in the sense of formulating and evaluating general theories. (Fischhoff, 2015)
	•	analyses rely on scientific results to guide the judgments needed when setting bounds, calculating estimates, and assessing their robustness. (Fischhoff, 2015)
	•	the cultural bias will never be satisfactorily addressed until the IC seriously reviews its analytic outreach and hiring practices. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Webster’s Dictionary defines analysis as division of a complex whole into its parts or elements. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	The essence of analysis is breaking down a problem into its component parts, assessing each part separately, then putting the parts back together to make a decision. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	It can certainly be said that analytical work is difficult because it is a form of critical thinking, and critical thinking is difficult (Cohen and Freeman 1997, Cohen et al. 1998, Feltovich et al. 2001, Elm et al. 2005, Moore and Krizan 2005, Moore 2006, 2010, Elder and Paul 2007, Henderson et al. 2010, Klein (this issue)). (Hoffman et al., 2011)
	•	Analysis of any kind involves breaking down problems into constituent parts, such as causes and effects, and using logical operations to identify and
	•	test hypotheses for the purposes of explanation and prediction. (Fishbein and Treverton, 2004)
	•	Analysis begins when the analyst consciously inserts himself or herself into the process to select, sort, and organize information. This selection and organization can only be accomplished according to conscious or subconscious assumptions and preconceptions. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Analysis of information to gain a better understanding of current developments and to estimate future outcomes is an essential component of decisionmaking in any field. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	By controlling the information made available to a group of experts and then checking the accuracy of judgments based on this information, it is possible to investigate how people use information to arrive at analytical judgments. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	analysis is, above all, a mental process. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Analysis is an exercise in judgment under conditions of uncertainty, and the errors in judgment we make, singly or in groups, in a day or through life, are countless. (Serrat, 2017)
	•	The best analysis is useless if those with authority to act on it do not use it. (Betts, 2007)
	•	Professionals optimize their analysis and let the chips fall where they may, even if they fall into a hole and are never noticed by anyone who could use them. (Betts, 2007)
	•	Analysis that undermines a policy option is most useful if it arrives before a decision to choose that option is made. It may be discomfiting or unwelcome even then, but it has more of a chance of affecting choice. Once policymakers move from decision to implementation, however, their interests become vested. (Betts, 2007)
	•	Analysis is the compilation, filtering, and detailed evaluation of information to focus and understand that information better and to develop knowledge or conclusions. (Army Publishing Directorate, 2020)
	•	Analysis performed by intelligence personnel assists in building the commander’s knowledge and understanding. ADP 6-0 provides an in-depth discussion on how commanders and staffs process data to progressively develop their knowledge to build and maintain their situational awareness and understanding. (See figure 1-1.) (Army Publishing Directorate, 2020)
	•	Analysis is the basis for many staff activities, including planning, and occurs across the entire Army. Among other results, analysis facilitates commanders and other decision makers’ ability to visualize the operational environment (OE), organize their forces, and control operations in order to achieve their objectives. (Army Publishing Directorate, 2020)
	•	Aujourd'hui, devant la discussion et l'analyse, toutes les opinions perdent leur prestige; leurs angles s'usent vite, et il en survit bien peu qui nous puissent passionner. L'homme moderne est de plus en plus envahi par l'indifférence. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	most human activities are based on experience rather than analysis. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
Science of analysis
	•	The science of analysis develops general methods for performing these tasks. Those methods include procedures for eliciting expert judgments (when observations are lacking), for com- bining diverse forms of evidence, and for assessing residual uncertainties (3, 7–10). (Fischhoff, 2015)
	•	The science of analysis has also developed methods for making ethical judgments (3–5). Those methods include procedures for eliciting individuals’ preferences directly and for inferring those preferences from their behavior (11, 12). (Fischhoff, 2015)
	•	The science of analysis has seen advances in both the sophistication of its calculations and the awareness of the ethical and scientific judgments that they entail. (Fischhoff, 2015)
	•	It has also developed better ways to integrate behavioral science knowledge when communicating with stakeholders, eliciting expert knowledge, assessing preferences, and anticipating the effects of behavior (e.g., of operators or patients). (Fischhoff, 2015)
Formal analysis
	•	Formal analyses can be valuable aids to decision-making if their limits are understood. (Fischhoff, 2015)
	•	Formal analyses are often commissioned to estimate the costs, risks, and benefits of projects or policies. (Fischhoff, 2015)
Analytical-deliberative process
	•	The success of an analytical-deliberative process is an empirical question (11, 12, 53, 54). One measure of that success is how well the process enables participants to understand the risks and develop stable preferences among them (e.g., can they make sound inferences based on what they know? Do their preferences change when additional perspectives are suggested?). A second measure is whether a process leads to fewer, but better, conflicts, by focusing participants on genuine disagreements and avoiding ones that arise from misunderstanding (e.g., can participants describe their opponents’ position, even when they reject it?). (Fischhoff, 2015)
Competitive analysis
	•	Competitive analysis would fail again for four major reasons. First, it would not apply to most of the major types of intelligence that consumers receive, largely due to the timeliness of these products. Second, the nature of decision-making, combined with the needs and time constraints on senior-level policymakers, would make competitive analysis self-defeating. Third, the increasing role of Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) and on-line tools available to intelligence agencies expose analysts to more diverse viewpoints on the same topic, without having to call in outsiders to present dissenting opinions. Finally, several agencies, each with differing opinions and bureaucratic alliances, already perform separate analysis in the current intelligence community structure. (Stack, 1997)
	•	To determine the utility of competitive analysis to strategic-level intelligence analysis, it is necessary to discuss the types of intelligence produced for senior- level decisionmakers. (Stack, 1997)
	•	The time available to compile, analyze, process, and evaluate the information before its presentation determines the length, depth, and quality of the analytical product for the consumer. (Stack, 1997)
	•	Because these intelligence products are created for the use of the busy policymakers, timelines are largely driven by current events, the "crisis du jour," or the urgency of the policy issues on the table. (Stack, 1997)
	•	The four major types of strategic-level intelligence are basic, current, warning, and estimative. Basic intelligence is largely encyclopedic in nature since it involves accumulating information concerning a country's military order of battle, telecommunications, terrain, etc. Therefore, competitive analysis here has no application. In today's chaotic international security environment, policy decisions are increasingly made in response to crisis events. Decisionmakers need timely, current intelligence to stay abreast of rapidly-changing events. Due to the dynamics and time pressures of reporting the information in daily intelligence productions, competitive analysis is irrelevant for current intelligence. (Stack, 1997)
	•	The necessity of conveying information in a timely manner prevents competitive analysis from being applicable to warning intelligence. (Stack, 1997)
	•	Because estimative intelligence involves deliberate analysis and long-term study, this is the only type of strategic intelligence where competitive analysis could be utilized. (Stack, 1997)
	•	Competitive analysis would be self-defeating. (Stack, 1997)
	•	the point of "competitive analysis" is to sharpen the issues and to force bureaucratic committees—so often characterized by consensus-seeking, to say nothing of plain inertia— to facethe difficulties in the lines of argument with which they have become comfortable.
(CIA, 1978)

Sound analysis
	•	Sound analysis requires sound communication between the analysts and the stakeholders whom they serve. (Fischhoff, 2015)
Knowledgeable analysis
	•	Knowledgeable analysis might be identified by the ability to fill in the qualification; careful analysis by the frequency with which one remembers to do so. (Heuer, 1999)
Systematic analysis
	•	A systematic analytical process requires selection among alternative hypotheses, and it is here that analytical practice often diverges significantly from the ideal and from the canons of scientific method. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	The ideal is to generate a full set of hypotheses, systematically evaluate each hypothesis, and then identify the hypothesis that provides the best fit to the data. (Heuer, 1999)
Intuitive analysis
	•	Intuitive analysis, by comparison, generally concentrates on confirming a hypothesis and commonly accords more weight to evidence supporting a hypothesis than to evidence that weakens it. (Heuer, 1999)
Data-driven analysis
	•	In this type of analysis, accuracy depends primarily upon the accu- racy and completeness of the available data. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	If one makes the reasonable assumption that the analytical model is correct and the further assumption that the analyst properly applies this model to the data, then the accuracy of the analytical judgment depends entirely upon the accuracy and completeness of the data. (Heuer, 1999)
Conceptually driven analysis 
	•	Conceptually driven analysis is at the opposite end of the spectrum from data-driven analysis. The questions to be answered do not have neat boundaries, and there are many unknowns. The number of potentially relevant variables and the diverse and imperfectly understood relation- ships among these variables involve the analyst in enormous complexity and uncertainty. (Heuer, 1999)
Negative analysis
	•	Negative analysis has a higher hurdle to surmount if it is to figure in the implementation phase. (Betts, 2007)
Analyst
	•	Data preparation and analysis often take time, but we need shorthand representations of those activities for those who are spectators or beneficiaries of them. It would be time-consuming and boring to share all the details of a quantitative analysis with stakeholders. Analysts need to find a way to deliver the salient findings from an analysis in a brief, snappy way. Stories fit the bill. (Haider, 2016)
Analyst awareness
	•	Analysts’ awareness of the complexity of the issues they deal with makes them sensitive to the reasons policies will not work. Analysts who complicate and equivocate do not compete as effectively for the limited attention of consumers as those who simplify and advocate— but the latter politicize their product more egregiously. (Betts, 2007)
Analytical assumption
	•	An analytical assumption is one part of a mental model or mind-set. (Heuer, 1999)
Analytical experience
	•	Substantive knowledge and analytical experience determine the store of memories and schemata the analyst draws upon to generate and evaluate hypotheses. The key is not a simple ability to recall facts, but the ability to recall patterns that relate facts to each other and to broader concepts—and to employ procedures that facilitate this process. (Heuer, 1999)
Analytic mind
	•	The analytic mind, in order to reach judgments, imposes patterns of behaviour—the explanation of tensions between reformers and conservatives in government x, the hidden hand of the military leadership being shown in country y—and this inevitably over-simplifies the chaos of reality. (Omand, 2014)
Analytical strategies
	•	Analytical strategies are important because they influence the data one attends to. They determine where the analyst shines his or her searchlight, and this inevitably affects the outcome of the analytical process. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Different analysts have different analytical habits and preferences for analytical strategy. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Differences in analytical strategy may cause fundamental differences in perspective between intelligence analysts and some of the policymakers for whom they write. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	The relevant strategies George identified are: "Satisficing"—selecting the first identified alternative that appears "good enough" rather than examining all alternatives to determine which is "best." Incrementalism—focusing on a narrow range of alternatives rep- resenting marginal change, without considering the need for dra- matic change from an existing position. Consensus—opting for the alternative that will elicit the greatest agreement and support. Simply telling the boss what he or she wants to hear is one version of this. Reasoning by analogy—choosing the alternative that appears most likely to avoid some previous error or to duplicate a previous success. Relying on a set of principles or maxims that distinguish a "good" from a "bad" alternative. (Heuer, 1999)
Optimal analytical strategy
	•	An optimal analytical strategy requires that analysts search for information to disconfirm their favorite theories, not employ a satisficing strategy that permits acceptance of the first hypothesis that seems consistent with the evidence. (Heuer, 1999)
Analytical thinking
	•	Thinking analytically is a skill like carpentry or driving a car. It can be taught, it can be learned, and it can improve with practice. But like many other skills, such as riding a bike, it is not learned by sitting in a classroom and being told how to do it. Analysts learn by doing. Most people achieve at least a minimally acceptable level of analytical performance with little conscious effort beyond completing their education. With much effort and hard work, however, analysts can achieve a level of excellence beyond what comes naturally. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Regular running enhances endurance but does not improve tech- nique without expert guidance. Similarly, expert guidance may be re- quired to modify long-established analytical habits to achieve an optimal level of analytical excellence. An analytical coaching staff to help young analysts hone their analytical tradecraft would be a valuable supplement to classroom instruction. (Heuer, 1999)
Analytical problem
	•	People have difficulty grasping a problem in all its complexity. (Heuer, 1999)

Complex analytical problem
	•	decomposing and externaliz- ing complex analytical problems when we cannot keep all the relevant factors in the forefront of our consciousness at the same time. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Figure 10 illustrates how The number of possible relationships between variables grows geometrically as the number of variables increases. as the number of variables in an analytical problem increases. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	As Franklin noted, decision problems are difficult because people cannot keep all the pros and cons in mind at the same time. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Anything that has parts also has a structure that relates these parts to each other. One of the first steps in doing analysis is to determine an appropriate structure for the analytical problem, so that one can then identify the various parts and begin assembling information on them. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	complex problems that typically involve ambiguous information, multiple players, and fluid circumstances. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Intelligence analysts, in seeking to make sound judgments, are always under challenge from the complexities of the issues they address and from the demands made on them for timeliness and volume of production. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	
Decomposition
	•	Decomposition means breaking a problem down into its component parts. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Decomposition means breaking a problem down into its component parts. That is, indeed, the essence of analysis. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	The spirit of decision analysis is to divide and conquer: Decompose a complex problem into simpler problems, get one’s thinking straight inthese simpler problems, paste these analyses together with a logical glue. (Heuer, 1999)
Externalization
	•	Externalization means getting the problem out of our heads and into some visible form that we can work with. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Externalization means getting the decomposed problem out of one’s head and down on paper or on a computer screen in some simplified form that shows the main variables, parameters, or elements of the problem and how they relate to each other. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	I call this drawing a picture of your problem. Others call it making a model of your problem. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Putting ideas into visible form ensures that they will last. They will lie around for days goading you into having further thoughts. Lists are effective because they exploit people’s tendency to be a bit compulsive—we want to keep adding to them. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	They let us get the obvious and habitual answers out of the way, so that we can add to the list by thinking of other ideas beyond those that came first to mind. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	One specialist in creativity has observed that “for the purpose of moving our minds, pencils can serve as crowbars”—just by writing things down and making lists that stimulate new associations. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	With the key elements of a problem written down in some abbreviated form, it is far easier to work with each of the parts while still keeping the problem as a whole in view. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Analysts can generally take account of more factors than when making a global judgment. They can manipulate individual elements of the problem to examine the many alternatives available through rearranging, combining, or modifying them. Variables may be given more weight or deleted, causal relationships reconceptual- ized, or conceptual categories redefined. Such thoughts may arise spontaneously, but they are more likely to occur when an analyst looks at each element, one by one, and asks questions designed to encourage and facilitate consideration of alternative interpretations. (Heuer, 1999)
Analytical performance
	•	Differences between stronger and weaker analytical performance are at- tributable in large measure to differences in the organization of data and experience in analysts’ long-term memory. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Their exceptional performance in remembering positions from actual games stems from their ability to immediately perceive patterns that enable them to process many bits of information together as a single chunk or schema. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	the unique abilities of the master analyst are attributable to the schemata in long-term memory that enable the analyst to perceive patterns in data that pass undetected by the average observer. (Heuer, 1999)
Analytical stories
	•	Stories have always been effective tools to transmit human experience; those that involve data and analysis are just relatively recent versions of them. Narrative is the way we simplify and make sense of a complex world. It supplies context, insight, interpretation—all the things that make data meaningful and analytics more relevant and interesting. (Haider, 2016)
	•	Stories that incorporate data and analytics are more convincing than those based on anecdotes or personal experience. Perhaps the most compelling stories of all are those that combine data and analytics, and a point of view or example that involves real people and organizations. (Haider, 2016)
Analytical weaknes
	•	“Hardening of the categories” is a common analytical weakness. (Heuer, 1999)
Analytics
	•	With analytics, your goal is normally to change how someone makes a decision or takes an action. You’re attempting to persuade, inspire trust, and lead change with these powerful tools. No matter how impressive your analysis is, or how high- quality your data, you’re not going to compel change unless the stakeholders for your work understand what you have done. That may require a visual story or a narrative one, but it does require a story. (Haider, 2016)
	•	Stories that incorporate data and analytics are more convincing than those based on anecdotes or personal experience. Perhaps the most compelling stories of all are those that combine data and analytics, and a point of view or example that involves real people and organizations. (Haider, 2016)
	•	The ultimate purpose of analytics is to communicate findings to the concerned who might use these insights to formulate policy or strategy. (Haider, 2016)
	•	Analytics summarize findings in tables and plots. The data scientist should then use the insights to build the narrative to communicate the findings. (Haider, 2016)
	•	All analytics are conducted to gain insights into a research question. A better understanding of the research question ensures that the subsequent actions are likely to bear fruit. It is also important to recognize that advanced analytics are not a panacea for a poorly structured research question. (Haider, 2016)
Anarchism
	•	anarchism, while perhaps not the most attractive political philosophy, is certainly an excellent foundation for epistemology, and for the philosophy of science. (Feyerabend, 1993)
Animus voices
	•	Jung called these animus voices: all the men over the years who have judged women for their looks and intelligence. You want to catch these voices as they occur and rid yourself of them. Because failures or criticisms might affect you too deeply, you can become afraid to try something again, which narrows your learning possibilities. (Greene, 2018)
Anomalies
	•	The things that do not fit the paradigm—the anomalies—tend to be ignored or explained away. (Greene, 2014)
	•	In truth, anomalies themselves contain the richest information. They often reveal to us the flaws in our paradigms and open up new ways of looking at the world. You must turn yourself into a detective, deliberately uncovering and looking at the very anomalies that people tend to disregard. (Greene, 2014)
Anchoring effect 
	•	It occurs when people consider a particular value for an unknown quantity before estimating that quantity. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	There is a form of anchoring that occurs in a deliberate process of adjustment, an operation of System 2. And there is anchoring that occurs by a priming effect, an automatic manifestation of System 1. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	Anchoring can be measured, and it is an impressively large effect. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	The anchoring effect is not a laboratory curiosity; it can be just as strong in the real world. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	Powerful anchoring effects are found in decisions that people make about money, such as when they choose how much to contribute al.ls denied to a cause  (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	anchoring effects have been obtained in numerous studies of estimates and of willingness to pay  (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	a key finding of anchoring research is that anchors that are obviously random can be just as effective as potentially informative anchors  (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	The psychological mechanisms that produce anchoring make us far more suggestible than most of us would want to be. And of course there are quite a few people who are willing and able to exploit our gullibility. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	Anchoring effects explain why, for example, arbitrary rationing is an effective marketing ploy. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	when negotiating for the first time in a bazaar, the initial anchor has a powerful effect (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	The effects of random anchors have much to tell us about the relationship between System 1 and System 2. Anchoring effects have always been studied in tasks of judgment and choice that are ultimately completed by System 2. However, System 2 works on data that is retrieved from memory, in an automatic and involuntary operation of System 1. System 2 is therefore susceptible to the biasing influence of anchors that make some information easier to retrieve. Furthermore, System 2 has no control over the effect and no knowledge of it. The participants who have been exposed to random or absurd anchors (such as Gandhi’s death at age 144) confidently deny that this obviously useless information could have influenced their estimate, and they are wrong. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	You are always aware of the anchor and even pay attention to it, but you do not know how it guides and constrains your thinking, because you cannot imagine how you would have thought if the anchor had been different (or absent). (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	When people experience an event, they tend to be psychologically “anchored” in the experience and more sensitive to the associated risks. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	(Heuer, 1999)
	•	Another strategy people seem to use intuitively and unconsciously to simplify the task of making judgments is called anchoring. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Some natural starting point, perhaps from a previous analysis of the same subject or from some partial calculation, is used as a first approximation to the desired judgment. This starting point is then adjusted, based on the results of additional information or analysis. Typically, however, the starting point serves as an anchor or drag that reduces the amount of adjustment, so the final estimate remains closer to the starting point than it ought to be. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Whenever analysts move into a new analytical area and take over responsibility for updating a series of judgments or estimates made by their predecessors, the previous judgments may have such an anchoring effect. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Anchoring provides a partial explanation of experiments showing that analysts tend to be overly sure of themselves in setting confidence ranges. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Reasons for the anchoring phenomenon are not well understood. The initial estimate serves as a hook on which people hang their first impressions or the results of earlier calculations. In recalculating, they take this as a starting point rather than starting over from scratch, but why this should limit the range of subsequent reasoning is not clear. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	One technique for avoiding the anchoring bias, to weigh anchor so to speak, may be to ignore one’s own or others’ earlier judgments and rethink a problem from scratch. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	a tendency to “anchor” analysis in the first or earliest important piece of information considered, so that later changes in judgments are typically small and rarely stray far from the initial judgment. (Artner et al., 2016)
Audience
	•	Audience, however, are hard to fool. They feek the lack of rigor, the imitative quality, the urge to get attention, and they turn their backs, or give the mildest praise that quickly passes. (Greene, 2014)
	•	les foules actives (aggressive, escape, acquisitive et expressive) auxquelles il réserve le terme de mob, et les foules passives qu’il appelle audiences. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	les moyens de communication ont besoin des masses, aussi pouvons-nous dire, en schématisant à peine, qu’ils créent les masses (ou contribuent fortement à le faire) sur lesquelles ils agissent ensuite. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	hommes et les femmes qui constituent le public sont confrontés à un modèle auquel ils sont préssés de se conformer. (Mannoni, 1985)
Audience acceptance
	•	People accept the facts which come to them through existing channels. They like to hear new things in accustomed ways. They have neither the time nor the inclination to search for facts that are not readily available to them. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
Auditable management systems for risk 
	•	auditable management systems for risk emerge as generic and totalizing instruments of risk governance, in rational design if not in operation (Power, 2009)
Audit
	•	The British Standards Institution (BSI) (2000) defined an audit as a “systematic examination to determine whether activities and related results conform to planned arrangements, and whether these arrangements are implemented effectively and are suitable for achieving the organization’s policy and objectives” (p. 11). (Newsome, 2013)
Security audit
	•	A risk or security audit is an unusual investigation into how an actor is managing risk or security. Most standard processes of risk management do not specify an audit as a separate part of the process, but at least imply that their advocacy of monitoring and reviewing includes a prescription to audit where and when necessary. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	The Humanitarian Practice Network (2010) defined security auditing as “an evaluation of the strengths and weaknesses in an organization’s security management and infrastructure in order to assess its effectiveness and identify areas for improvement” (p. xviii). (Newsome, 2013)
	•	A security audit, also called a security controls review, is a veri cation that the security controls that have been speci ed are properly implemented. (Landoll, 2011)
	•	Depending on the standards, these security audits can be quite rigorous and even involve statistically relevant sampling techniques and complete verification of all findings. (Landoll, 2011)
	•	In most cases a “security audit” would cost far more than a security risk assessment. (Landoll, 2011)
Risk management audit
	•	Australia/New Zealand and ISO (International Organization for Standardization, 2009a) defined a risk management audit as a “systematic, independent, and documented process for obtaining evidence and evaluating it objectively in order to determine the extent to which the risk management framework or any selected part of it is adequate and effective” (p. 12). (Newsome, 2013)

Audit society
	•	In place of uncertainty as the space of entrepreneurialism, organizations of all kinds are being organized, legalized, and made auditable. (Power, 2009)
	•	Power sees the development of an ‘audit society’ in the UK and other states, which responds to risk and regulatory failure by ‘greater investment in formal, generalizable systems of control rather than by developing non-standard capabilities for acting on informal sources of inteligence’. (Hood et al., 2001)
	•	Power (1997) claims the advent of an ‘audit society’ has triggered a boom in interactive forms of information-gathering in many fields of risk regulation. (Hood et al., 2001)

Affect-as-information mode 
	•	According to this model, people rely on their present feelings in heuristic fashion to make complex judgements, as long as the experienced feelings are perceived as relevant to the object of judgement (Clore, 1992; Schwarz, 1990; Schwarz & Clore, 1983). (Lerner and Keltner, 2000)
	•	the affect-as-information hypothesis is a model of how feelings influence (social) judgments. (Loewenstein et al., 2001)
	•	The affect- as-information hypothesis correctly predicts that feelings during the judgment or decision process affect people's judgments or choices in those cases where the feelings are (correctly or through misattributions) experienced as reactions to the imminent judgment or decision. (Loewenstein et al., 2001)
Agenda-setting
	•	Agenda-setting involves decisions about which substances should be selected (and often in what order) for more intense formal regulatory review. (National Research Council, 1983)
Anger
	•	It is natural and healthy for you to feel anger at certain types of people—those who unfairly block your advancement, the many fools who have power but are lazy and incompetent, the sanctimonious critics who espouse their clichés with so much conviction and attack you without understanding your views. The list could go on forever. Feeling such anger can be a powerful motivating device to take some kind of action. It can fill you with valuable energy. You should embrace it and use it throughout your life for such a purpose. What might make you hold back or tamp down your anger is that it can seem to be such a toxic and ugly emotion, as it often is in our culture. (Greene, 2018)
	•	What makes anger toxic is the degree to which it is disconnected from reality. People channel their natural frustrations into anger at some vague enemy or scapegoat, conjured up and spread by demagogues. They imagine grand conspiracies behind simple inescapable realities, such as taxes or globalism or the changes that are part of all historical periods. They believe that certain forces in the world are to blame for their lack of success or power, instead of their own impatience and lack of effort. There is no thought behind their anger, and so it leads nowhere or it becomes destructive. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Your anger iscontrolled, realistic, and targeted at the actual source of the problem, never losing sight of what initially inspired the emotion.Most people engage in some cathartic release of their anger, some giant protest, and then it goes away and they slip back into complacency or become bitter. You want to cool your anger, bring it more to a simmer than a boil. Your controlled anger will help give you the resolve and patience you will need for what might be a longer struggle than you had imagined. Let the unfairness or injustice lie in the back of your mind and keep you energized. The real satisfaction comes not in one spasm of emotion but in actually defeating the bully and exposing the narrow-minded for who they are. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Do not be afraid to use your anger in your work, particularly if it is allied to some cause or if you are expressing yourself through something creative. It is often the sense of contained rage that makes an orator so effective; it was the source of much of the charisma of Malcolm X. (Greene, 2018)
Agression
	•	This is a profound misconception of human nature. Aggression is a tendency that is latent in every single human individual. It is a tendency wired into our species. We became the preeminent animal on this planet precisely because of our aggressive energy, supplemented by our intelligence and cunning. We cannot separate this aggressiveness from the way we attack problems, alter the environment to make our lives easier, fight injustice, or create anything on a large scale. (Greene, 2018)
	•	The Latin root of the word aggression means“to step forward,” and when we assert ourselves in this world and try to create or change anything, we are tapping into this energy.Aggression can serve positive purposes. At the same time, under certain circumstances, this energy can push us into antisocial behavior, into grabbing too much or pushing people around. These positive and negative aspects are two sides of the same coin. And although some individuals are clearly more aggressive than others, all of us are capable of slipping into that negative side. (Greene, 2018)
	•	There is a continuum of human aggression, and we are all on the spectrum. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Being unaware of our true nature causes us many problems. We can turn aggressive in the negative sense without realizing what is happening, and then pay the consequences for going too far. Or, feeling uncomfortable with our own assertive impulses and knowing the trouble they can stir, we might try to repress our aggressiveness and appear to be paragons of humility and goodness, only to become more passive-aggressive in our behavior. This energy cannot be denied or repressed; it will emerge in some way. But with awareness, we can begin to control and channel it for productive and positive purposes. To do so, we must understand the source of all human aggression, how it turns negative, and why some people become more aggressive than others. (Greene, 2018)
Human aggression
	•	human aggression stems from an underlying insecurity, as opposed to simply an impulse to hurt or take from others. Before any impulse to take aggressive action, aggressors are unconsciously processing feelings of helplessness and anxiety. They often perceive threats that are not really there, or exaggerate them. They take action to preempt the perceived attack of another, or to grab for things in order to dominate a situation they feel may elude their control. (Such feelings also provoke the positive type of aggression as well. Feeling the need to fight an injustice or create something important is preceded by feelings of anxiety and insecurity. It remains an attempt at control for positive purposes.) When we look at any chronic aggressor around us, we must search for the underlying insecurity, the deep wound, the reverberating feelings of helplessness from their earliest years. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Human aggression in individuals and in groups tends to emerge or heat up when we feel helpless and vulnerable, when the impatience for control and effect rises. And as increasing numbers of people and groups are feeling this way, we can expect more of this and not less in the future. Wars will get dirtier. As insecurities rise, there will be more confrontations between political groups, between cultures, between generations, between men and women. And there will be even better and more sophisticated ways for humans to justify their aggression to themselves and to the world. (Greene, 2018)
Passive aggression
	•	The root cause of all passive aggression is the human fear of direct confrontation. Because of this fear some people look for indirect means for getting their way, making their attacks subtle enough so that it is hard to figure out what is going on, while giving them control of the dynamic. (Greene, 2014)
	•	On the surface, the people around you appear so polite and civilized. But beneath the mask, they are all inevitably dealing with frustrations. They have a need to influence people and gain power over circumstances. Feeling blocked in their endeavors, they often try to assert themselves in manipulative ways that catch you by surprise. And then there are those whose need for power and impatience to obtain it are greater than others. They turn particularly aggressive, getting their way by intimidating people, being relentless and willing to do almost anything. You must transform yourself into a superior observer of people’s unsatisfied aggressive desires, paying extra attention to the chronic aggressors and passive aggressors in our midst. You must recognize the signs— the past patterns of behavior, the obsessive need to control everything in their environment—that indicate the dangerous types. They depend on making you emotional—afraid, angry—and unable to think straight. Do not give them this power. When it comes to your own aggressive energy, learn to tame and channel it for productive purposes—standing up for yourself, attacking problems with relentless energy, realizing great ambitions. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Most of us are afraid of outright confrontation; we want to appear reasonably polite and sociable. But often it is impossible to get what we want without asserting ourselves in some way. People can be stubborn and resistant to our influence, no matter how congenial we are. And sometimes we need a release from all of the inner tension that comes from having to be so deferential and correct. And so all of us inevitably engage in behavior in which we assert ourselves indirectly, striving for control or influence as subtly as possible. Perhaps we take extra time to respond to people’s communications, to signal a slight bit of disdain for them; or we seem to praise people but insert subtle digs that get under their skin and instill doubts. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Sometimes we make a comment that could be taken as quite neutral, but our tone of voice and the expression on our face indicate we are upset, stirring up some guilt.We can call this form of aggression passive, in that we give the appearance that we are merely being ourselves, not actively manipulating or trying to influence people. Nevertheless, a message is sent that creates the effect we desire. We are never quite as passive as we seem in this. In the back of our minds, we are aware that we are taking an extra long time to get back to someone or putting a dig in a comment, but at the same time we can also pretend to ourselves and to others that we are innocent. (We humans are capable of holding such conflicting thoughts at the same time.) In general, we must consider this everyday version of passive aggression to be merely an irritating part of social life, something we are all guilty of. We should be as tolerant as possible of this low-grade passive aggression that thrives in polite society. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Some people, however, are chronic passive aggressors. Like the more active aggressors, they generally have a high degree of energyand need for control but at the same time a fear of outright confrontation. They often had domineering or neglectful parents; passive aggression became their way of getting attention or asserting their will while avoiding punishment. Such behavior becomes a pattern for them as adults, as they often repeat the same types of strategies that worked in childhood. (If we observe the passive aggressor closely enough, we can often see the manipulative child peeking through the adult mask.) (Greene, 2018)
	•	These chronic types operate in a personal or work relationship, in which their drip-drip passive-aggressive strategies can take effect on an individual over time. They are masters at being ambiguous and elusive—we can never quite be sure that they are attacking us; perhaps we are imagining things and are paranoid. If they were directly aggressive, we would get angry and resist them, but by being indirect they sow confusion, and exploit such confusion for power and control. If they are truly good at this and get their hooks into our emotions, they can make our lives miserable.Keep in mind that actively aggressive types can generally be quite passive-aggressive at times, as Rockefeller certainly was. Passive aggression is simply an additional weapon for them in their attempts at control. In any event, the key to defending ourselves against passive aggressors is to recognize what they are up to as early as possible. (Greene, 2018)
The Subtle-Superiority Strategy
	•	A friend, colleague, or employee is chronically late, but he or she always has a ready excuse that is logical, along with an apology that seems sincere. Or similarly, such individuals forget about meetings, important dates, and deadlines, always with impeccable excuses at hand. If this behavior repeats often enough, your irritation will increase, but if you try to confront them, they very well might try to turn the tables by making you seem uptight and unsympathetic. It is not their fault, they say— they have too much on their mind, people are pressuring them, they are temperamental artists who can’t keep on top of so many irritating details, they are overwhelmed. They may even accuse you of adding to their stress. (Greene, 2018)
	•	You must understand that at the root of this is the need to make it clear to themselves and to you that they are in some way superior. Ifthey were to say in so many words that they felt superior to you, they would incur ridicule and shame. They want you to feel it in subtle ways, while they are able to deny what they are up to. Putting you in the inferior position is a form of control, in which they get to define the relationship. You must pay attention to the pattern more than the apologies, but also notice the nonverbal signs as they excuse themselves. The tone of the voice is whiny, as if they really feel it is your problem. The apologies are laid on extra thick to disguise the lack of sincerity; in the end, such excuses communicate more about their problems in life than about the facts of their forgetfulness. They are not really sorry. (Greene, 2018)
	•	If this is chronic behavior, you must not get angry or display overt irritation—passive aggressors thrive on getting a rise out of you. Instead, stay calm and subtly mirror their behavior, calling attention to what they are doing, and inducing some shame if possible. You might make dates or appointments and leave them in the lurch, or show up impossibly late with the sincerest of apologies, laced with a touch of irony. Let them brood on what this might mean. (Greene, 2018)
	•	If you are dealing with a boss or someone in a position of power who makes you wait, their assertion of superiority is not so subtle. The best you can do is keep as calm as possible, showing your own form of superiority by remaining patient and cool. (Greene, 2018)
The Sympathy Strategy
	•	Somehow the person you are dealing with is always the victim—of irrational hostility, of unfair circumstances, of society in general. You notice with these types thatthey seem to relish the drama in their stories. No one else suffers as they do. If you are careful, you can detect a vaguely bored expression when they listen to other people’s problems; they are not so engaged. Because they play up their supposed helplessness, you will naturally feel sympathetic, and once they elicit this, they will ask for favors, extra care, and attention. That is the control they are after. They are hypersensitive to any signs of doubt on your face, and they don’t want to hear advice or how they might be slightly to blame. They may explode and classify you as one of the victimizers.What might make this hard to see through is that often they do suffer through unusual adversity and personal pain, but they are masters at attracting the pain. They choose partners who will disappoint them; they have a bad attitude at work and attract criticism; they are negligent with details, and so things around them fall apart. It is not malicious fate that is to blame but something from within them that wants and feeds off the drama. People who are genuine victims cannot help but feel some shame and embarrassment at their fate, part of an age-old human superstition that a person’s bad luck is a sign of something wrong with the individual. These true victims do not enjoy telling their stories. They do so reluctantly. Passive aggressors, on the other hand, are dying to share what has happened to them and bask in your attention. (Greene, 2018)
	•	As part of this, passive aggressors may display various symptoms and ailments—anxiety attacks, depression, headaches—that make their suffering seem quite real. Since childhood, we have all been capable of willing such symptoms to get attention and sympathy. We can make ourselves sick with worry; we can think our way into depression. What you are looking for is the pattern: this seems to recur in passive aggressors when they need something (such as a favor), when they feel you pulling away, when they feel particularly insecure. In any case, they tend to soak up your time and mental space, infecting you with their negative energy and needs, and it is very hard to disengage. (Greene, 2018)
	•	These types will often prey upon those who are prone to feel guilty— the sensitive, caregiving types. To deal with the manipulation involved here you need some distance, and this is not easy. The only way to do this is to feel some anger and resentment at the time and energy you are wasting in trying to help them, and how little they give back to you. The relationship inevitably tilts in their favor when it comes to attention. That is their power. Creating some inner distance will allowyou to see through them better and eventually quit the unhealthy relationship. Do not feel bad about this. You will be surprised at how quickly they find another target. (Greene, 2018)
The Dependency Strategy
	•	You are suddenly befriended by someone who is unusually attentive and concerned for your welfare. They want to help you with your work or some other tasks. They want to listen to your stories of hardship and adversity. How refreshing and unusual to have such attention. You find yourself becoming ever so dependent on what they give you. But every now and then you detect some coldness on their part, and you rack your brain to figure out what you might have said or done to trigger this. In fact, you can’t really be sure if they’re upset with you, but you find yourself trying to please them nonetheless, and slowly, without really noticing it, the dynamic is reversed, and the displays of sympathy and concern seem to shift from them to you. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Sometimes a similar dynamic is played out between parents and their children. A mother, for instance, can shower her daughter with affection and love, keeping the girl bound to her. If the daughter tries to exercise independence at some point, the mother responds as if this were an aggressive and unloving act on the daughter’s part. To avoid feeling guilty, the daughter stops asserting herself and works harder to earn more of the affection she has become dependent on. The relationship has reversed itself. Later, the mother exercises control over other aspects of her daughter’s life, including money, career, and intimate partners. This can also occur within couples. (Greene, 2018)
	•	A variation of this strategy comes from people who love to make promises (of assistance, money, a job), but don’t quite deliver on them. Somehow they forget what they had promised, or only give you part of it, always with a reasonable excuse. If you complain, they may accuse you of being greedy or insensitive. You have to chase after them to make up for your rudeness or to beg to get some of what they had promised.In any event, this strategy is all about gaining power over another. The person who is made to feel dependent is returned to the position of the needy and vulnerable child, wanting more. It is hard to imagine that someone who is or was so attentive could be using this as a ploy, which makes it doubly hard to see through. You must be wary of those who are too solicitous too early on in a relationship. It is unnatural, aswe are normally a bit suspicious of people in the beginning of any relationship. They may be trying to make you dependent in some way, and so you must keep some distance before you can truly gauge their motives. If they start to turn cold and you are confused as to what you did, you can be nearly certain they are using this strategy. If they react with anger or dismay when you try to establish some distance or independence, you can clearly see the power game as it emerges. Getting out of any such relationships should be a priority. (Greene, 2018)
	•	In general, be wary about people’s promises and never completely rely on them. With those who fail to deliver, it is more likely a pattern, and it is best to have nothing more to do with them. (Greene, 2018)
The Insinuating-Doubt Strategy
	•	In the course of a conversation, someone you know, perhaps a friend, lets slip a comment that makes you wonder about yourself and if they are in some way insulting you. Perhaps they commend you on your latest work, and with a faint smile they say they imagine you will get lots of attention for it, or lots of money, the implication being that that was your somewhat dubious motive. Or they seem to damn you with faint praise: “You did quite well for someone of your background.” (Greene, 2018)
	•	people may say some rather harsh things about you, and if you seem upset, they will say they were kidding: “Can’t you take a joke?” They may interpret things you have said in a slightly negative light, and if you call them on this, they will innocently reply, “But I’m only repeating what you said.” They may use these insinuating comments behind your back as well, to sow doubts in other people’s minds about you. They will also be the first ones to report toyou any bad news, or bad reviews, or the criticisms of others, always expressed with sympathy, but secretly delighting in your pain. (Greene, 2018)
	•	The point of this strategy is to make you feel bad in a way that gets under your skin and causes you to think of the insinuation for days. They want to strike blows at your self-esteem. Most often they are operating out of envy. The best counter is to show that their insinuations have no effect on you. You remain calm. You “agree” with their faint praise, and perhaps you return it in kind. They want to get a rise out of you, and you will not give them this pleasure. Hinting that you might see through them will perhaps infect them with their own doubts, a lesson worth delivering. (Greene, 2018)
The Blame-Shifter Strategy
	•	With certain people, you feel irritated and upset by something they have done. Perhaps you have felt used by them, or they’ve been insensitive or ignored your pleas to stop behavior that is unpleasant. Even before you express your annoyance, they seem to have picked up your mood, and you can detect some sulking on their part. And when you do confront them, they grow silent, wearing a hurt or disappointed look. It is not the silence of someone with remorse. They may respond with a “Fine. Whatever. If that’s how you feel.” Any apologies on their part are said in a way (through tone of voice or facial expressions) that subtly conveys some disbelief that they have done anything wrong. (Greene, 2018)
	•	If they are really clever, in response they might conjure up something you’ve said or done in the past, which you’ve forgotten but which still rankles them, as if you are not so innocent. It doesn’t sound like something you’ve said or done, but you can’t be sure. Perhaps they will say something in their defense that pushes your buttons, and as you get angry, they can now accuse you of being hostile, aggressive, and unfair.Whatever their type of response, you are left with the feeling that perhaps you were wrong all along. Maybe you overreacted or were paranoid. You might even slightly doubt your sanity—you know you felt upset, but maybe you can’t trust your own feelings. Now you are the one to feel guilty, as if you were to blame for the tension. Better to reassess yourself and not repeat this unpleasant experience, you tell yourself. As an adjunct to this strategy, passive aggressors are often quite nice and polite to other people, only playing their games on you, since you are the one they want to control. If you try to confide inpeople your confusion and anger, you get no sympathy, and the blame shifting has double the effect. (Greene, 2018)
	•	This strategy is a way of covering up all kinds of unpleasant behavior, of deflecting any kind of criticism, and of making people skittish about ever calling them on what they are doing. In this way they can gain power over your emotions and manipulate them as they see fit, doing whatever they want with impunity. They are exploiting the fact that many of us, since early childhood, are prone to feeling guilty at the slightest impetus. This strategy is used most obviously in personal relationships, but you will find it in more diffused form in the work world. People will use their hypersensitivity to any criticism, and the ensuing drama they stir up, to dissuade people from ever trying to confront them. (Greene, 2018)
	•	To counter this strategy, you need to be able to see through the blame shifting and remain unaffected by it. Your goal is not to make them angry, so don’t get caught in the trap of exchanging recriminations. They are better at this drama game than you are, and they thrive by their power to rankle you. Be calm and even fair, accepting some of the blame for the problem, if that seems right. Realize that it is very difficult to get such types to reflect on their behavior and change it; they are too hypersensitive for this.What you want is to have the requisite distance to see through them and to disengage. To help in this, you must learn to trust your past feelings. In the moments they are irritating you, write down what they are doing and memorialize their behavior. Perhaps in doing so, you will realize that you are in fact overreacting. But if not, you can return to these notes to convince yourself that you are not crazy and to stop the blame-shifting mechanism in its tracks. If you don’t allow the shifting to occur, they might be discouraged from using this strategy. If not, it is best to lessen your involvement with such a passive aggressor. (Greene, 2018)
The Passive-Tyrant Strategy
	•	The person you are working for seems to be bubbling with energy, ideas, and charisma. They are a bit disorganized, but that is normal—they have so much to do, so much responsibility and so many plans, they can’t keep on top of it all. They need your help, and you strain every fiber of your being to provide it. You listen extra hard to their instructions and try to execute them. Occasionally they praise you, and this keeps you going, but sometimesthey rail at you for letting them down, and this sticks in your mind more than the praise. (Greene, 2018)
	•	You can never feel comfortable or take your position for granted. You have to try harder to avoid these nasty temperamental rants. They’re such perfectionists, with such high standards, and you’re not measuring up. You rack your brain to anticipate their needs and live in terror of displeasing them. If they were actively ordering you around, you would simply do what they asked. But by being somewhat passive and moody, they force you to work doubly hard to please them. (Greene, 2018)
	•	This strategy is generally used by those in power on their underlings, but it could be applied by people in relationships, one partner tyrannizing the other by simply being impossible to please. The strategy is based on the following logic: If people know what it is that you want and how to get it for you, they have some power over you. If they follow your instructions and do your bidding, you cannot criticize them. If they are consistent, you can even grow dependent on their work, and they can squeeze concessions out of you by threatening to leave. But if they have no idea what actually works, if they can’t exactly discern what kind of behavior draws praise and what draws punishment, they have no power, no independence, and can be made to do anything. As with a dog, an occasional pat on their shoulder will deepen their submission. (Greene, 2018)
	•	If people quit on these tyrants, they are fine with that. This demonstrates that the individual retains some independence, and they will find a replacement who will be more submissive, at least for the time being. They may also increase their difficult behavior to test certain individuals and get them to quit or submit. Such tyrants may try to act like helpless children. They are the temperamental artist or genius type, so naturally brilliant and absentminded. Their pleas for assistance from you and their urgent need for you to do more seem to express their vulnerability. They use such feigned weakness to justify the ugly nature of their tyranny. (Greene, 2018)
	•	It is very hard to strategize against such types, because most often they are your superiors and have real power over you. They tend to be hypersensitive and prone to anger, which makes any form of resistance or inner detachment hard to maintain. Overt rebellion will only makethe situation worse. You must first realize that this strategy of theirs is more conscious than it appears. They are not weak and helpless but cunning tyrants. Instead of lingering on anything positive they’ve said or done, think only of their manipulations and harshness. Your ability to detach from them emotionally will neutralize the obsessive presence they try to instill. But in the end nothing really will work, because if, in their hypersensitivity, they detect your distance, their behavior will only get worse. The only real counter is to quit and recuperate. No position is worth such abuse, for the damage to your self-esteem could take years to recover from. (Greene, 2018)
Aggressive behaviour
	•	We are born with a powerful energy that is distinctly human. We can call it willpower, assertiveness, or even aggression, but it is mixed with our intelligence and cleverness. It was revealed to us in its purest state in childhood. This energy made us bold and adventurous, not only physically but mentally, wanting to explore ideas and soak up knowledge. It made us actively search for friends with whom we could explore together. It also made us rather relentless when it came to solving problems or getting what we wanted. (Children can often be bold in what they ask for.) It made us open to the world and to new experiences. And if we felt frustrated and helpless for long enough periods of time, this same energy could make us unusually combative. As we get older and we encounter mounting frustrations, resistance from others, and feelings of impatience for power, some among us may become chronically aggressive. But another phenomenon is even more common: we become uncomfortable with and even frightened of that assertive energy within, and our own potential for aggressive behavior. Being assertive and adventurous could lead to some failed action, making us feel exposed and vulnerable. If we express this energy too much, people may not like us. We could stir up conflict. Perhaps our parents induced in us as well some shame for our aggressive outbursts. In any event, we may come to view the aggressive part of the self as dangerous. But since this energy cannot disappear, it turns inward, and we create what the great English psychoanalyst Ronald Fairbairn called the internal saboteur. (Greene, 2018)
Aggressive energy
	•	In truth, what we can attribute it to more than anything is the sheer relentless force of will that he possessed to utterly dominate every situation and rival he encountered, and to exploit every opportunity that crossed his path. We shall call this aggressive energy. Such energy can have productive purposes (see the last section in the chapter for more on this), and certainly Rockefeller had some achievements that benefited the society of his time. But as so often happens with highly aggressive people, this energy pushed him to monopolize virtually all power in a complex industry. It made him wipe out all rivals and any possible competition, bend laws to his benefit, standardize all practices according to his desires, and in the end, depress innovation in the field. (Greene, 2018)
Agressor
	•	Keep in mind that aggressors often get their way because you fear that in fighting them, you have too much to lose in the present. But you must calculate instead what you have to lose in the long term— decreasing options for power and expansion in your own field, once they assume a dominating position; your own dignity and sense of self- worth by not standing up to them. Surrender and docility can become a habit with devastating consequences for your well-being. Use the existence of aggressors as a spur to your own fighting spirit and to build your own confidence. Standing up to and outwitting aggressors can be one of the most satisfying and ennobling experiences we humans can have. (Greene, 2018)
	•	First, aggressors have less tolerance for feelings of helplessness and anxiety than the rest of us. What might cause us to feel frustrated or insecure will often trigger in them a much more powerful reaction, and rage. This is perhaps why chronic aggression is much more common among men than women. Men find it harder to manage feelings of dependency and helplessness, something psychologists have noted in male infants. Men are generally more insecure about their status in the work world and elsewhere. They have a greater need to continually assert themselves and gauge their effect on others. Their self-esteem is tied to feelings of power, control, and respect for their opinions. And so it often takes less to trigger the aggressive response in men. In any event, we must always be aware that the chronic aggressor is more thin-skinned than we are, and if we know we are dealing with this type, we must be particularly careful to not inadvertently trigger their rage response by challenging their self- esteem or criticizing them.Another common aspect of aggressive behavior is that it can easily become an addiction. In acting out their desires in an overt and immediate way, in getting the best of people through their maneuvers, aggressors receive a jolt of adrenaline that can become addictive. They feel stimulated and excited, and the more socially acceptable ways of relieving boredom can seem tepid in comparison. (Certainly the thrill of getting easy money, whether as Wall Street brokers peddling dubious investments or as criminals stealing what they can, has an immensely addictive quality.) At first glance, this might seem self- destructive, as each aggressive outburst creates more enemies and unintended consequences. But aggressors are often adept at upping the ante with even more intimidating behavior, so that few will challenge them. (Greene, 2018)
	•	We must also be aware that aggressors see the people around them as objects to use. They might have some natural empathy, but because their need for power and control is so strong, they cannot be patient enough to rely solely upon charm and social skills. To get what they want, they have to use people, and this becomes a habit that degrades any empathy they once had. They need adherents and disciples, so they train themselves to listen, to occasionally praise others, and to do favors for people. The charm they may display upon occasion, however, is only for effect and has little human warmth to it. When they are listening to us, they are gauging the strength of our will and seeing how we can serve their purposes down the road. If they praise us or do us a favor, it is a way to further entrap and compromise us.We can see this in the nonverbal cues, in the eyes that look through us, in how thinly they are engaged in our stories. We must always try to make ourselves immune to any attempt at charm on their part, knowing what purpose it serves. (Greene, 2018)
	•	It is interesting to note that despite all of the socially negative qualities that aggressors inevitably reveal, they are frequently able to attract enough followers to help them in their quest for power. The people who are attracted to such aggressors often have their own deep- seated issues, their own frustrated aggressive desires. They find the confidence and sometimes brazenness of the aggressor quite exciting and appealing. They fall in love with the narrative. They become infected with the leader’s aggression and get to act it out on others, perhaps those below them. But such an environment is tiring, and those serving the aggressor are constantly taking hits to their self- esteem. With most aggressors, the turnover is high and the morale low. As the ancient Greek dramatist Sophocles once wrote, “Whoever makes his way into a tyrant’s court becomes his slave, although he went there a free man.” (Greene, 2018)
	•	The aggressor type will show such physical obsessions—always front and center. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Aggressors generally have the advantage that they are willing to go outside the guardrails more often and more widely in fighting you. This gives them more options, more dirty maneuvers they can surprise you with. In negotiations, they will hit you with some last-minute change to what they had agreed upon, violating all rules but knowing you will give in because you have come this far and don’t want to blow it up. They will spread rumors and disinformation to muddy the waters and make you seem as dubious as they are. You must try to anticipate these manipulations and rob aggressors of the element of surprise. (Greene, 2018)
Agressor’s narrative
	•	To repress such a thought, he constructed what we shall call the aggressor’s narrative. He had to convince himself that his quest for power served some higher purpose. There was a belief at the time among Protestants that to make a lot of money was a sign of grace from God. With wealth, the religious individual could give back to the community and help support the local parish. But Rockefeller took this further. He believed that establishing order in the oil business was a divine mission, like ordering the cosmos. He was on a crusade to bring cheap prices and predictability to American households. Turning Standard Oil into a monopoly blended seamlessly with his deep religious convictions.Sincerely believing in this crusade, it did not bother his conscience to ruthlessly manipulate and ruin his rivals, to bribe legislators, to run roughshod over laws, to form fake rival enterprises to Standard Oil, to spark and use the violence of a strike (with Pennsylvania Railroad) that would help him in the long run. Belief in this narrative made him all the more energetic and aggressive, and for those who faced him, it could be confusing—perhaps there was some good in what he was doing; perhaps he was not a demon after all. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Finally, to realize his dream of control, Rockefeller transformed himself into a superior reader of men and their psychology. And the most important quality for him to gauge in the various rivals he faced was their relative willpower and resiliency. He could sense this in people’s body language and in the patterns of their actions. Most people, he determined, are rather weak. They are mostly led by their emotions, which change by the day. They want things to be rather easy in life and tend to take the path of least resistance. They don’t have a stomach for protracted battles. They want money for the pleasures and comforts it can bring, for their yachts and mansions. They want to look powerful, to satisfy their ego. Make them afraid or confused or frustrated, or offer them an easy way out, and they would surrender tohis stronger will. If they got angry, all the better. Anger burns itself out quickly, and Rockefeller always played for the long term. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Pay close attention to how they justify their actions in the world. Aggressors will tend to present themselves as crusaders, as some form of genius who cannot help the way they behave. They are creating great art, they say, or helping the little man. People who get in their way are infidels and evil. They will claim, as Rockefeller did, that no one has been criticized or investigated as much as they have; they are the victims, not the aggressors. The louder and more extreme their narrative, the more you can be certain you are dealing with chronic aggressors. Focus on their actions, their past patterns of behavior, much more than anything they say. (Greene, 2018)
Controlled aggression
	•	Your goal is not to repress this assertive energy but to become aware of it as it drives you forward and to channel it productively. You need to admit to yourself that you have a deep desire to have an effect on people, to have power, and to realize this you must develop higher social and technical skills, must become more patient and resilient. You need to discipline and tame your natural assertive energy. This is what we shall call controlled aggression, and it will lead to accomplishing great things. (For more on this, see the last section of this chapter. (Greene, 2018)
Chronic aggressor
	•	Chronic aggressors often have obsessive personalities. Having meticulous habits and creating a completely predictable environment is their way of holding control. Obsessing over an object or a person indicates a desire to swallow it whole. (Greene, 2018)
Defeating aggressor
	•	You can practice deception and distract them, appearing weaker than you are, baiting them into an attack that will make them look bad and for which you have prepared a crafty counterattack. You can even spread rumors that will tend to imbalance their minds, since they arenot used to others playing the same tricks back on them. In any event, with the stakes being high, you must calculate that defeating aggressors is more important than maintaining your purity. (Greene, 2018)
Primitive aggressor
	•	Primitive aggressors have very short fuses. If someone triggers in them feelings of inferiority or weakness, they explode. They lack any self-control, and so they tend to not get very far in life, inevitably bullying and hurting too many people. (Greene, 2018)
Sophisticated aggressors
	•	Rockefeller represents a type of individual that you will likely come across in your field. We shall call this type the sophisticated aggressor, as opposed to the primitive aggressor. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Sophisticated aggressors are much trickier. They rise to top positions and can stay there because they know how to cloak their maneuvers, to present a distracting façade, and to play upon people’s emotions. They know that most people do not like confrontation or long struggles, and so they can intimidate or wear people down. They depend on our docility as much as on their own aggression. (Greene, 2018)
	•	The sophisticated aggressors that you encounter do not have to be as spectacularly successful as a Rockefeller. They can be your boss, a rival, or even a scheming colleague on the way up. You can recognize them by one simple sign: they get to where they’re going primarily through their aggressive energy, not through their particular talents. They value amassing power more than the quality of their work. They do whatever is necessary to secure their position and crush any kind of competition or challenge. They do not like to share power. (Greene, 2018)
	•	In dealing with this type, you will tend to become angry or fearful, enlarging their presence and playing into their hands. You obsess over their evil character and fail to pay close attention to what they are actually up to. What you often end up surrendering to is the appearance or illusion of strength that they project, their aggressive reputation. The way to handle them is to lower the emotional temperature. Start by looking at the individual, not the myth or legend. Understand their primary motivation—to gain control over the environment and the people around them. As with Rockefeller, this need for control covers up vast layers of anxieties and insecurities. You must see the frightened child within, terrified by anything unpredictable. In this way you can cut them down to size, diminishing their ability to intimidate you. (Greene, 2018)
	•	They want to control your thoughts and reactions. Deny them this power by focusing on their actions and your strategies, not your feelings. Analyze and anticipate their real goals. They want to instill in you the idea that you have no options, that surrender is inevitable and the best way out. But you always have options. Even if they are your boss and you must surrender in the present, you can maintain your inner independence and plot for the day in which they make a mistakeand are weakened, using your knowledge of their vulnerable points to help take them down. (Greene, 2018)
	•	See through their narrative and their shrewd attempts at distraction. They will often present themselves as holier-than-thou or as the victim of other people’s malice. The louder they proclaim their convictions, the more certain you can be they’re hiding something. Be aware that they can sometimes seem charming and charismatic. Do not be mesmerized by such appearances. Look at their patterns of behavior. If they have taken from people in the past, they will continue to do so in the present. Never bring on such types as partners, no matter how friendly and charming they might seem. They like to piggyback on your hard work, then wrest control. Your realistic appraisal of their actual strength and their aggressive intentions is your best defense. (Greene, 2018)
	•	When it comes to taking action against aggressors, you must be as sophisticated and crafty as they are. Do not try to fight with them directly. They are too relentless, and they usually have enough power to overwhelm you in direct confrontation. You must outwit them, finding unexpected angles of attack. Threaten to expose the hypocrisy in their narrative or the past dirty deeds they have tried to keep hidden from the public. Make it seem that a battle with you will be costlier than they had imagined, that you are also willing to play a little dirty, but only in defense. If you are particularly clever, appear relatively weak and exposed, baiting them into a rash attack that you have prepared for. Often the wisest strategy is to band together with others who have suffered at their hands, creating strength and leverage in numbers. (Greene, 2018)
	•	If battle with them is inevitable, never engage in direct confrontation or challenge them in an overt way. If they are the sophisticated type, they will use all their cunning to ruin you, and they can be relentless. You must always fight them indirectly. Look for the vulnerabilities they are inevitably covering up. This could be their dubious reputation, some particularly dirty actions in the past they have managed to keep secret. Poke holes in their narrative. Through exposure of what they want to keep hidden, you have a powerful weapon to scare them out of attacking you. Remember that their greatest fear is to lose control. Think of what act of yours could frighten them by setting off a chain reaction of events that might spin out of control. Make the easy victory they are counting on with you suddenly seem more expensive. (Greene, 2018)
Agressor trap
	•	This often leads to the phenomenon of the aggressor’s trap: the more power they get, and the larger their empire, the more points of vulnerability they create; they have more rivals and enemies to worry about. This sparks in them the need to be more and more aggressive and gain more and more power. (Certainly Rockefeller fell victim to this dynamic.) They also come to feel that to stop acting in this way would make them seem weak. No matter what aggressors might say to us or how they try to disguise their intentions, we must realize that their past pattern of behavior will inevitably continue in the present,because they are both addicted and trapped. We must never be naive in dealing with them. They will be relentless. If they take a step back, it is only momentary. They are rarely capable of changing this essential pattern in their behavior. (Greene, 2018)
Alchemy
	•	In alchemy, the goal was to find a way to transform base metals or stones into gold. (Greene, 2014)
Amaterurism
	•	Amateurism my be variously considered to be about doing things for the love of them, doing them without reward or material gain or doing them unprofessionally. It is a development of the idea of the amateur, a French word primarily indicating action or consumption arising from taste rather than instrumental self-interest. The appendage of an ‘-ism' to amateur indicates (as with 'racism' or `capitalism') either or both of a belief or a doctrine which stresses the role of the amateur or a tendency to act as if the distinction between amateur and non-amateur were important. The earliest references to amateurs in English were in the eighteenth century, but it is only in the second half ofthe nineteenth that the word amateurism (as opposed to amateurship) comes into common use. (Allison, 2001)
	•	Amateurs and amateurism can exist in a wide variety ofhuman activities, but it is only in sport that amateurism has been carefully defined and redefined and amused social and political emotions of an intensity that has led non-amateurs to be described as 'vermin' and 'performing monkeys' and non-amateurism as the ethical equivalent or 'touching pitch. (Allison, 2001)
	•	The concept of amateurism is the product of a society (and later other societies) which aspire in varying degrees to the conficting models of commercialism and professionalism. (Allison, 2001)
Ambiguity
	•	ambiguity is a result of divergent or contested perspectives on the justification, severity or wider ‘meanings’ associated with a given threat (Stirling, 2003).
	•	The term ambiguity may be misleading here because it has different connotations in everyday English.5 In relation to risk governance it is understood as ‘giving rise to several meaningful and legitimate interpretations of accepted risk assessments results’. (Renn, 2007b)
	•	A condition of ambiguity emerges where the problem lies in agreeing on the appropriate values, priorities, assumptions or boundaries to be applied to the definition of possible outcomes. (Renn, 2007b)
	•	ambiguity can also be aggravated by an excess of data. (Betts, 2007)
	•	In the words of Michael Handel, ‘Ambiguity legitimizes different interpretations, allowing politically motivated parties to select the one they prefer. The absence of clarity may also strengthen the tendency of some statesmen to become their own intelligence officers. (Omand, 2014)
Interpretative ambiguity
	•	different interpretations of an identical assessment result, for example as an adverse or non-adverse effect. (Renn, 2007b)
Normative ambiguity
	•	different concepts of what can be regarded as tolerable referring, for example, to ethics, quality of life parameters, distribution of risks and benefits. (Renn, 2007b)
Ambivalance
	•	Where there are ambiguous and conflicting indicators (the context of most failures of intelligence), the imperatives of honesty and accuracy leave a careful analyst no alternative but ambivalence. (Betts, 2007)
Assessment of analytic performance 
	•	Assessment of analytic performance often is done by outside bodies with negative findings exploited by media and external critics, thus prompting a defensive stance among intelligence professionals. (Fishbein and Treverton, 2004)
Analogy
	•	The workings of analogy should not be seen as bringing chaos into order, 'it is on the contrary in the service of reason, a reason indeed somewhat short of memory, but none the less a true and necessary motive power of language' (1964 [1897]: 76). (Hutton, 1998)
Anomie
	•	anomiques qui sont les signes sociologiques d’une mutation. (Mannoni, 1985)
Anomic individual
	•	Rappelons que c’est parmi ces incompris, souvent persécutés, que se recrutent les grands fondateurs, les créateurs de croyances et d’institutions. (Mannoni, 1985)
Anticipation
	•	“anticipation” (efforts to predict and prevent potential dangers from arising before they have ever occurred) (Sagan, 1995). (Renn, 2007b)
	•	anticipates the future by remembering the past and thus judges the present correctly. (Omand, 2014)
	•	Governments have therefore equipped themselves with complex systems for horizon scanning, forecasting and prediction in order to minimize the risk of being caught by surprise. (Omand, 2014)
	•	Sophisticated agents have another means of adaptation: anticipation (‘lookahead’). IF an agent has a set of rules that simulates part of its world, then it can run this internal model to examine the outcomes of different action asequences before those actions are executed. (Holland, 2014)
Anticipatory self-defence
	•	Anticipatory self-defence was its official legal justification for attacking Afghanistan in 2001. The political reshaping of societies most at risk of fostering terrorism is deemed by some to be a sensible precautionary measure. (Coker, 2009)
Antagonism
	•	An excellent gauge for decoding antagonism is to compare people’s body language toward you and toward others. (Greene, 2018)
Anxiety
	•	Anxiety here is very much a social construction; how we look at the world and life in general determines our level of anxiety. (Coker, 2009)
	•	Unlike fear, anxiety is grounded not in the immediate or the perceived, but the imagined. (Coker, 2009)
	•	To combat this anxiety he would have to keep control of all aspects of the business, overseeing even the spelling and grammar of the smallest publicity notice. He would have to create a very loose structure within his companies, making all of the executives fight among themselves for his attention. Better to have some internal chaos as long as everything flowed through him. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Not wanting to go too far in either direction, we mostly live within the present. We react to what we see and hear and to what others are reacting to. We live for immediate pleasures to distract us from the passage of time and make us feel more alive. But we pay a price for all this. Repressing the thought of death and aging creates a continual underlying anxiety. We are not coming to terms with reality. Continually reacting to events in the present puts us on a roller coaster ride—up and down we go with each change in fortune. This can only add to our anxiety, as life seems to pass so quickly in the immediate rush of events. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Depression and anxiety come from not being your complete self, from always playing a role. (Greene, 2018)
Aleatory society
	•	Rome was a culture that looked danger in the eye. It did not attempt to avert or calculate danger, but rather to assert (almost celebrate) the uncertainties, chances and dangers of human existence. That is what I mean by referring to it as an aleatory society. This is a very different way of imagining danger from on to the Romans. They were not simply the dupes of Fate, they ‘managed’ danger by repeatedly reminding themselves to face it head on. (Beard, 2011)
Autobiographical sociology
	•	Autobiographical sociology also include studies which take advantage of any life-transforming experience as an occasion for research (Corbetta, 2003)
	•	Autobiography that turns into research is not the ideal type of participant observation, and is open to many criticisms. (Corbetta, 2003)
Appearance
	•	People tend to wear the mask that shows them off in the best possible light—humble, confident, diligent. They say the right things, smile, and seem interested in our ideas. They learn to conceal their insecurities and envy. If we take this appearance for reality, we never really know their true feelings, and on occasion we are blindsided by their sudden resistance, hostility, and manipulative actions. Fortunately, the mask has cracks in it. People continually leak out their true feelings and unconscious desires in the nonverbal cues they cannot completely control—facial expressions, vocal inflections, tension in the body, and nervous gestures. (Greene, 2018)
	•	since appearances are what people judge you by, you must learn how to present the best front and play your role to maximum effect. (Greene, 2018)
	•	we are poorly equipped to gauge the character of the people we deal with. Their public image, the reputation that precedes them, easily mesmerizes us. We are captivated by appearances. If they surround themselves with some alluring myth, as Hughes did, we want to believe in it. Instead of determining people’s character—their ability to work with others, to keep to their promises, to remain strong in adverse circumstances—we choose to work with or hire people based on their glittering résumé, their intelligence, and their charm. But even a positive trait such as intelligence is worthless if the person also happens to be of weak or dubious character. And so, because of our blind spot, we suffer under the irresolute leader, the micromanaging boss, the conniving partner. This is the source of endless tragedies in history, our pattern as a species. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Train yourself to ignore the front that people display, the myth that surrounds them, and instead plumb their depths for signs of their character. This can be seen in the patterns they reveal from their past, the quality of their decisions, how they have chosen to solve problems, how they delegate authority and work with others, and countless other signs. (Greene, 2018)
	•	we tend to base our judgments of people on what is most apparent. (Greene, 2018)
Appraisal tendencies
	•	appraisal tendencies are goal-directed processes through which emotions exert effects on judgement and choice until the emotion-eliciting problem is resolved. (Lerner and Keltner, 2000)
	•	appraisal-tendency processes apply to the effects of both momentary and dispositional emotions. (Lerner and Keltner, 2000)
	•	According to the appraisal-tendency hypothesis, an emotion’s underlying appraisal theme dictates its in ̄uence on subsequent judgements. Whereas the sense of uncertainty and situational control that defines fear should lead fearful people to make relatively pessimistic risk assessments, the sense of certainty and individual control that define anger should lead angry people to make relatively optimistic risk assessments. (Lerner and Keltner, 2000)
	•	The appraisal-tendency approach provides a flexible yet specific framework for developing a host of testable hypotheses concerning affect, judgement and decision making. (Lerner and Keltner, 2000)
Apprenticeship
	•	all that should concern you in the early stages of your career is acquiring practical knowledge in the most efficient manner possible. For this purpose, during the Apprenticeship Phase you will need mentors whose authority you recognize and to whom you submit. Your admission of need does not say anything essential about you, but only about your temporary condition of weakness, which your mentor will help you overcome. (Greene, 2014)
Approximation
Ad hoc approximation
	•	ad hoc approximations conceal, and even entirely eliminate, qualitative difficulties. They create a false impression of the excellence of our science. (Feyerabend, 1993)
Architecture
	•	À notre sens, cette pensée avait deux faces. C'était d'abord une pensée de prêtre. C'était l'effroi du sacerdoce devant un agent nouveau, l'imprimerie. C'était l'épouvante et l'éblouissement de l'homme du sanctuaire devant la presse lumineuse de Gutenberg. C'était la chaire et le manuscrit, la parole parlée et la parole écrite, s'alarmant de la parole imprimée ; quelque chose de pareil à la stupeur d'un passereau qui verrait l'ange Légion ouvrir ses six millions d'ailes. C'était le cri du prophète qui entend déjà bruire et fourmiller l'humanité émancipée, qui voit dans l'avenir l'intelligence saper la foi, l'opinion détrôner la croyance, le monde secouer Rome. Pronostic du philosophe qui voit la pensée humaine, volatilisée par la presse, s'évaporer du récipient théocratique. Terreur du soldat qui examine le bélier d'airain et qui dit : La tour croulera. Cela signifiait qu'une puissance allait succéder à une autre puissance. Cela voulait dire : La presse tuera l'église. (Hugo and Chamarat, 1998)
	•	C'était pressentiment que la pensée humaine en changeant de forme allait changer de mode d'expression, que l'idée capitale de chaque génération ne s'écrirait plus avec la même matière et de la même façon, que le livre de pierre, si solide et si durable, allait faire place au livre de papier, plus solide et plus durable encore. Sous ce rapport, la vague formule de l'archidiacre avait un second sens ; elle signifiait qu'un art allait détrôner un autre art. Elle voulait dire : L'imprimerie tuera l'architecture. (Hugo and Chamarat, 1998)
	•	depuis l'origine des choses jusqu'au quinzième siècle de l'ère chrétienne inclusivement, l'architecture est le grand livre de l'humanité, l'expression principale de l'homme à ses divers états de développement soit comme force, soit comme intelligence. (Hugo and Chamarat, 1998)
	•	Quand la mémoire des premières races se sentit surchargée, quand le bagage des souvenirs du genre humain devint si lourd et si confus que la parole, nue et volante, risqua d'en perdre en chemin, on les transcrivit sur le sol de la façon la plus visible, la plus durable et la plus naturelle à la fois. On scella chaque tradition sous un monument. (Hugo and Chamarat, 1998)
	•	Les premiers monuments furent de simples quartiers de roche que le fer n'avait pas touchés, dit Moïse. L'architecture commença comme toute écriture. Elle fut d'abord alphabet. On plantait une pierre debout, et c'était une lettre, et chaque lettre était un hiéroglyphe, et sur chaque hiéroglyphe reposait un groupe d'idées comme le chapiteau sur la colonne. Ainsi firent les premières races, partout, au même moment, sur la surface du monde entier. On retrouve la pierre levée des celtes dans la Sibérie d'Asie, dans les pampas d'Amérique. (Hugo and Chamarat, 1998)
	•	Plus tard on fit des mots. On superposa la pierre à la pierre, on accoupla ces syllabes de granit, le verbe essaya quelques combinaisons. Le dolmen et le cromlech celtes, le tumulus étrusque, le galgal hébreu, sont des mots. Quelques-uns, le tumulus surtout, sont des noms propres. Quelquefois même, quand on avait beaucoup de pierre et une vaste plage, on écrivait une phrase. L'immense entassement de Karnac est déjà une formule tout entière. Enfin on fit des livres. (Hugo and Chamarat, 1998)
	•	Les traditions avaient enfanté des symboles, sous lesquels elles disparaissaient comme le tronc de l'arbre sous son feuillage ; tous ces symboles, auxquels l'humanité avait foi, allaient croissant, se multipliant, se croisant, se compliquant de plus en plus ; les premiers monuments ne suffisaient plus à les contenir ; ils en étaient débordés de toutes parts ; à peine ces monuments exprimaient-ils encore la tradition primitive, comme eux simple, nue et gisante sur le sol. (Hugo and Chamarat, 1998)
	•	Le symbole avait besoin de s'épanouir dans l'édifice. L'architecture alors se développa avec la pensée humaine ; elle devint géante à mille têtes et à mille bras, et fixa sous une forme éternelle, visible, palpable, tout ce symbolisme flottant. Tandis que Dédale, qui est la force, mesurait, tandis qu'Orphée, qui est l'intelligence, chantait, le pilier qui est une lettre, l'arcade qui est une syllabe, la pyramide qui est un mot, mis en mouvement à la fois par une loi de géométrie et par une loi de poésie, se groupaient, se combinaient, s'amalgamaient, descendaient, montaient, se juxtaposaient sur le sol, s'étageaient dans le ciel, jusqu'à ce qu'ils eussent écrit, sous la dictée de l'idée générale d'une époque, ces livres merveilleux qui étaient aussi de merveilleux édifices ; la pagode d'Eklinga, le Rhamseïon d'Egypte, le temple de Salomon. L'idée mère, le verbe, n'était pas seulement au fond de tous ces édifices, mais encore dans la forme. Le temple de Salomon, par exemple, n'était point simplement la reliure du livre saint, il était le livre saint lui-même. Sur chacune de ses enceintes concentriques les prêtres pouvaient lire le verbe traduit et manifesté aux yeux, et ils suivaient ainsi ses transformations de sanctuaire en sanctuaire jusqu'à ce qu'ils le saisissent dans son dernier tabernacle sous sa forme la plus concrète qui était encore de l'architecture : l'arche. Ainsi le verbe était enfermé dans l'édifice, mais son image était sur son enveloppe comme la figure humaine sur le cercueil d'une momie. (Hugo and Chamarat, 1998)
	•	Et non seulement la forme des édifices mais encore l'emplacement qu'ils se choisissaient révélait la pensée qu'ils représentaient. Selon que le symbole à exprimer était gracieux ou sombre, la Grèce couronnait ses montagnes d'un temple harmonieux à l'oeil, l'Inde éventrait les siennes pour y ciseler ces difformes pagodes souterraines portées par de gigantesques rangées d'éléphants de granit. Ainsi, durant les six mille premières années du monde, depuis la pagode la plus immémoriale de l'Hindoustan jusqu'à la cathédrale de Cologne, l'architecture a été la grande écriture du genre humain. Et cela est tellement vrai que non seulement tout symbole religieux, mais encore toute pensée humaine a sa page dans ce livre immense et son monument. Toute civilisation commence par la théocratie et finit par la démocratie. Cette loi de la liberté succédant à l'unité est écrite dans l'architecture. (Hugo and Chamarat, 1998)
	•	Car, insistons sur ce point, il ne faut pas croire que la maçonnerie ne soit puissante qu'à édifier le temple, qu'à exprimer le mythe et le symbolisme sacerdotal, qu'à transcrire en hiéroglyphes sur ses pages de pierre les tables mystérieuses de la loi. S'il en était ainsi, comme il arrive dans toute société humaine un moment où le symbole sacré s'use et s'oblitère sous la libre pensée, où l'homme se dérobe au prêtre, où l'excroissance des philosophies et des systèmes ronge la face de la religion, l'architecture ne pourrait reproduire ce nouvel état de l'esprit humain, ses feuillets, chargés au recto, seraient vides au verso, son oeuvre serait tronquée, son livre serait incomplet. Mais non. (Hugo and Chamarat, 1998)
	•	Prenons pour exemple le moyen-âge, où nous voyons plus clair parce qu'il est plus près de nous. Durant sa première période, tandis que la théocratie organise l'Europe, tandis que le Vatican rallie et reclasse autour de lui les éléments d'une Rome faite avec la Rome qui gît écroulée autour du Capitole, tandis que le christianisme s'en va recherchant dans les décombres de la civilisation antérieure tous les étages de la société et rebâtit avec ces ruines un nouvel univers hiérarchique dont le sacerdoce est la clef de voûte, on entend sourdre d'abord dans ce chaos, puis on voit peu à peu sous le souffle du christianisme, sous la main des barbares, surgir des déblais des architectures mortes, grecque et romaine, cette mystérieuse architecture romane, soeur des maçonneries théocratiques de l'Egypte et de l'Inde, emblème inaltérable du catholicisme pur, immuable hiéroglyphe de l'unité papale. Toute la pensée d'alors est écrite en effet dans ce sombre style roman. On y sent partout l'autorité, l'unité, l'impénétrable, l'absolu, Grégoire VII ; partout le prêtre, jamais l'homme ; partout la caste, jamais le peuple. Mais les croisades arrivent. C'est un grand mouvement populaire ; et tout grand mouvement populaire, quels qu'en soient la muse et le but dégage toujours de son dernier précipité l'esprit de liberté. Des nouveautés vont se faire jour. Voici que s'ouvre la période orageuse des Jacqueries, des Pragueries et des Ligues. L'autorité s'ébranle, l'unité se bifurque. La féodalité demande à partager avec la théocratie, en attendant le peuple qui surviendra inévitablement et qui se fera, comme toujours, la part du lion. Quia nominor leo. La seigneurie perce donc sous le sacerdoce, la commune sous la seigneurie. La face de l'Europe est changée. Eh bien  ! la face de l'architecture est changée aussi. Comme la civilisation, elle a tourné la page, et l'esprit nouveau des temps la trouve prête à écrire sous sa dictée. Elle est revenue des croisades avec l'ogive, comme les nations avec la liberté. Alors, tandis que Rome se démembre peu à peu, l'architecture romane meurt. L'hiéroglyphe déserte la cathédrale et s'en va blasonner le donjon pour faire un prestige à la féodalité. La cathédrale elle-même, cet édifice autrefois si dogmatique, envahie désormais par la bourgeoisie, par la commune, par la liberté, échappe au prêtre et tombe au pouvoir de l'artiste. L'artiste la bâtit à sa guise. Adieu le mystère, le mythe, la loi. Voici la fantaisie et le caprice. Pourvu que le prêtre ait sa basilique et son autel, il n'a rien à dire. Les quatre murs sont à l'artiste. Le livre architectural n'appartient plus au sacerdoce, à la religion, à Rome ; il est à l'imagination, à la poésie, au peuple. De là les transformations rapides et innombrables de cette architecture qui n'a que trois siècles, si frappantes après l'immobilité stagnante de l'architecture romane qui en a six ou sept. L'art cependant marche à pas de géant. Le génie et l'originalité populaires font la besogne que faisaient les évêques. Chaque race écrit en passant sa ligne sur le livre ; elle rature les vieux hiéroglyphes romans sur le frontispice des cathédrales, et c'est tout au plus si l'on voit encore le dogme percer çà et là sous le nouveau symbole qu'elle y dépose. La draperie populaire laisse à peine deviner l'ossement religieux. On ne saurait se faire une idée des licences que prennent alors les architectes, même envers l'église. Ce sont des chapiteaux tricotés de moines et de nonnes honteusement accouplés, comme à la salle des Cheminées du Palais de Justice à Paris. C'est l'aventure de Noé sculptée en toutes lettres comme sous le grand portail de Bourges. C'est un moine bachique à oreilles d'âne et le verre en main riant au nez de toute une communauté, comme sur le lavabo de l'abbaye de Bocherville. Il existe à cette époque, pour la pensée écrite en pierre, un privilège tout à fait comparable à notre liberté actuelle de la presse. C'est la liberté de l'architecture. (Hugo and Chamarat, 1998)
	•	Cette liberté va très loin. Quelquefois un portail, une façade, une église tout entière présente un sens symbolique absolument étranger au culte, ou même hostile à l'église. Dès le treizième siècle Guillaume de Paris, Nicolas Flamel au quinzième, ont écrit de ces pages séditieuses. Saint-Jacques-de-la-Boucherie était toute une église d'opposition. La pensée alors n'était libre que de cette façon, aussi ne s'écrivait-elle tout entière que sur ces livres qu'on appelait édifices. Sans cette forme édifice, elle se serait vue brûler en place publique par la main du bourreau sous la forme manuscrit, si elle avait été assez imprudente pour s'y risquer. La pensée portail d'église eût assisté au supplice de la pensée livre. Aussi n'ayant que cette voie, la maçonnerie, pour se faire jour, elle s'y précipitait de toutes parts. De là l'immense quantité de cathédrales qui ont couvert l'Europe, nombre si prodigieux qu'on y croit à peine, même après l'avoir vérifié. Toutes les forces matérielles, toutes les forces intellectuelles de la société convergèrent au même point : l'architecture. De cette manière, sous prétexte de bâtir des églises à Dieu, l'art se développait dans des proportions magnifiques. (Hugo and Chamarat, 1998)   
	•	Alors, quiconque naissait poète se faisait architecte. Le génie épars dans les masses, comprimé de toutes parts sous la féodalité comme sous une testudo de boucliers d'airain, ne trouvant issue que du côté de l'architecture, débouchait par cet art, et ses Iliades prenaient la forme de cathédrales. Tous les autres arts obéissaient et se mettaient en discipline sous l'architecture. C'étaient les ouvriers du grand oeuvre. L'architecte, le poète, le maître totalisait en sa personne la sculpture qui lui ciselait ses façades, la peinture qui lui enluminait ses vitraux, la musique qui mettait sa cloche en branle et soufflait dans ses orgues. Il n'y avait pas jusqu'à la pauvre poésie proprement dite, celle qui s'obstinait à végéter dans les manuscrits, qui ne fût obligée pour être quelque chose de venir s'encadrer dans l'édifice sous la forme d'hymne ou de prose ; le même rôle, après tout, qu'avaient joué les tragédies d'Eschyle dans les fêtes sacerdotales de la Grèce, la Genèse dans le temple de Salomon. (Hugo and Chamarat, 1998)
	•	Ainsi, jusqu'à Gutenberg, l'architecture est l'écriture principale, l'écriture universelle. Ce livre granitique commencé par l'Orient, continué par l'antiquité grecque et romaine, le moyen-âge en a écrit la dernière page. Du reste, ce phénomène d'une architecture de peuple succédant à une architecture de caste que nous venons d'observer dans le moyen-âge, se reproduit avec tout mouvement analogue dans l'intelligence humaine aux autres grandes époques de l'histoire. Ainsi, pour n'énoncer ici que sommairement une loi qui demanderait à être développée en des volumes, dans le haut Orient, berceau des temps primitifs, après l'architecture hindoue, l'architecture phénicienne, cette mère opulente de l'architecture arabe ; dans l'antiquité, après l'architecture égyptienne dont le style étrusque et les monuments cyclopéens ne sont qu'une variété, l'architecture grecque, dont le style romain n'est qu'un prolongement surchargé du dôme carthaginois ; dans les temps modernes, après l'architecture romane, l'architecture gothique. Et en dédoublant ces trois séries, on retrouvera sur les trois soeurs aînées, l'architecture hindoue, l'architecture égyptienne, l'architecture romane, le même symbole : c'est-à-dire la théocratie, la caste, l'unité, le dogme, le mythe, Dieu ; et pour les trois soeurs cadettes, l'architecture phénicienne, l'architecture grecque, l'architecture gothique, quelle que soit du reste la diversité de forme inhérente à leur nature, la même signification aussi ; c'est-à-dire la liberté, le peuple, l'homme. (Hugo and Chamarat, 1998)
	•	Qu'il s'appelle bramine, mage ou pape, dans les maçonneries hindoue, égyptienne ou romane, on sent toujours le prêtre, rien que le prêtre. Il n'en est pas de même dans les architectures de peuple. Elles sont plus riches et moins saintes. Dans la phénicienne, on sent le marchand ; dans la grecque, le républicain ; dans la gothique, le bourgeois. Les caractères généraux de toute architecture théocratique sont l'immutabilité, l'horreur du progrès, la conservation des lignes traditionnelles, la consécration des types primitifs, le pli constant de toutes les formes de l'homme et de la nature aux caprices incompréhensibles du symbole. Ce sont des livres ténébreux que les initiés seuls savent déchiffrer. Du reste, toute forme, toute difformité même y a un sens qui la fait inviolable. Ne demandez pas aux maçonneries hindoue, égyptienne, romane, qu'elles réforment leur dessin ou améliorent leur statuaire. Tout perfectionnement leur est impiété. Dans ces architectures, il semble que la roideur du dogme se soit répandue sur la pierre comme une seconde pétrification. (Hugo and Chamarat, 1998)
	•	Les caractères généraux des maçonneries populaires au contraire sont la variété, le progrès, l'originalité, l'opulence, le mouvement perpétuel. Elles sont déjà assez détachées de la religion pour songer à leur beauté, pour la soigner, pour corriger sans relâche leur parure de statues ou d'arabesques. Elles sont du siècle. Elles ont quelque chose d'humain qu'elles mêlent sans cesse au symbole divin sous lequel elles se produisent encore. De là des édifices pénétrables à toute âme, à toute intelligence, à toute imagination, symboliques encore, mais faciles à comprendre comme la nature. Entre l'architecture théocratique et celle-ci, il y a la différence d'une langue sacrée à une langue vulgaire, de l'hiéroglyphe à l'art, de Salomon à Phidias. Si l'on résume ce que nous avons indiqué jusqu'ici très sommairement en négligeant mille preuves et aussi mille objections de détail, on est amené à ceci : que l'architecture a été jusqu'au quinzième siècle le registre principal de l'humanité, que dans cet intervalle il n'est pas apparu dans le monde une pensée un peu compliquée qui ne se soit faite édifice, que toute idée populaire comme toute loi religieuse a eu ses monuments ; que le genre humain enfin n'a rien pensé d'important qu'il ne l'ait écrit en pierre. Et pourquoi  ? C'est que toute pensée, soit religieuse, soit philosophique, est intéressée à se perpétuer, c'est que l'idée qui a remué une génération veut en remuer d'autres, et laisser trace. Or quelle immortalité précaire que celle du manuscrit  ! Qu'un édifice est un livre bien autrement solide, durable, et résistant  ! Pour détruire la parole écrite il suffit d'une torche et d'un turc. Pour démolir la parole construite, il faut une révolution sociale, une révolution terrestre. Les barbares ont passé sur le Colisée, le déluge peut-être sur les Pyramides. (Hugo and Chamarat, 1998)
	•	Au quinzième siècle tout change. La pensée humaine découvre un moyen de se perpétuer non seulement plus durable et plus résistant que l'architecture, mais encore plus simple et plus facile. L'architecture est détrônée. Aux lettres de pierre d'Orphée vont succéder les lettres de plomb de Gutenberg.   Le livre va tuer l'édifice. (Hugo and Chamarat, 1998)
	•	L'invention de l'imprimerie est le plus grand événement de l'histoire. C'est la révolution mère. C'est le mode d'expression de l'humanité qui se renouvelle totalement, c'est la pensée humaine qui dépouille une forme et en revêt une autre, c'est le complet et définitif changement de peau de ce serpent symbolique qui, depuis Adam, représente l'intelligence. (Hugo and Chamarat, 1998)
	•	Sous la forme imprimerie, la pensée est plus impérissable que jamais ; elle est volatile, insaisissable, indestructible. Elle se mêle à l'air. Du temps de l'architecture, elle se faisait montagne et s'emparait puissamment d'un siècle et d'un lieu. Maintenant elle se fait troupe d'oiseaux, s'éparpille aux quatre vents, et occupe à la fois tous les points de l'air et de l'espace. (Hugo and Chamarat, 1998)
	•	Nous le répétons, qui ne voit que de cette façon elle est bien plus indélébile  ? De solide qu'elle était elle devient vivace. Elle passe de la durée à l'immortalité. On peut démolir une masse, comment extirper l'ubiquité  ? Vienne un déluge, la montagne aura disparu depuis longtemps sous les flots que les oiseaux voleront encore ; et, qu'une seule arche flotte à la surface du cataclysme, ils s'y poseront, surnageront avec elle, assisteront avec elle à la décrue des eaux, et le nouveau monde qui sortira de ce chaos verra en s'éveillant planer au-dessus de lui, ailée et vivante, la pensée du monde englouti. Et quand on observe que ce mode d'expression est non seulement le plus conservateur, mais encore le plus simple, le plus commode, le plus praticable à tous, lorsqu'on songe qu'il ne traîne pas un gros bagage et ne remue pas un lourd attirail, quand on compare la pensée obligée pour se traduire en un édifice de mettre en mouvement quatre ou cinq autres arts et des tonnes d'or, toute une montagne de pierres, toute une forêt de charpentes, tout un peuple d'ouvriers, quand on la compare à la pensée qui se fait livre, et à qui il suffit d'un peu de papier, d'un peu d'encre et d'une plume, comment s'étonner que l'intelligence humaine ait quitté l'architecture pour l'imprimerie  ? Coupez brusquement le lit primitif d'un fleuve d'un canal creusé au-dessous de son niveau, le fleuve désertera son lit. (Hugo and Chamarat, 1998)
	•	Aussi voyez comme à partir de la découverte de l'imprimerie l'architecture se dessèche peu à peu, s'atrophie et se dénude. Comme on sent que l'eau baisse, que la sève s'en va, que la pensée des temps et des peuples se retire d'elle  ! Le refroidissement est à peu près insensible au quinzième siècle, la presse est trop débile encore, et soutire tout au plus à la puissante architecture une surabondance de vie. Mais, dès le seizième siècle, la maladie de l'architecture est visible ; elle n'exprime déjà plus essentiellement la société ; elle se fait misérablement art classique ; de gauloise, d'européenne, d'indigène, elle devient grecque et romaine, de vraie et de moderne, pseudo-antique. C'est cette décadence qu'on appelle renaissance. Décadence magnifique pourtant, car le vieux génie gothique, ce soleil qui se couche derrière la gigantesque presse de Mayence, pénètre encore quelque temps de ses derniers rayons tout cet entassement hybride d'arcades latines et de colonnades corinthiennes. C'est ce soleil couchant que nous prenons pour une aurore. Cependant, du moment où l'architecture n'est plus qu'un art comme un autre, dès qu'elle n'est plus l'art total, l'art souverain, l'art tyran, elle n'a plus la force de retenir les autres arts. Ils s'émancipent donc, brisent le joug de l'architecte, et s'en vont chacun de leur côté. Chacun d'eux gagne à ce divorce. L'isolement grandit tout. La sculpture devient statuaire, l'imagerie devient peinture, le canon devient musique. On dirait un empire qui se démembre à la mort de son Alexandre et dont les provinces se font royaumes. De là Raphaël, Michel-Ange, Jean Goujon, Palestrina, ces splendeurs de l'éblouissant seizième siècle. (Hugo and Chamarat, 1998)
	•	En même temps que les arts, la pensée s'émancipe de tous côtés. Les hérésiarques du moyen-âge avaient déjà fait de larges entailles au catholicisme. Le seizième siècle brise l'unité religieuse. Avant l'imprimerie, la réforme n'eût été qu'un schisme, l'imprimerie la fait révolution. Otez la presse, l'hérésie est énervée. Que ce soit fatal ou providentiel, Gutenberg est le précurseur de Luther. Cependant, quand le soleil du moyen-âge est tout à fait couché, quand le génie gothique s'est à jamais éteint à l'horizon de l'art, l'architecture va se ternissant, se décolorant, s'effaçant de plus en plus. Le livre imprimé, ce ver rongeur de l'édifice, la suce et la dévore. Elle se dépouille, elle s'effeuille, elle maigrit à vue d'oeil. Elle est mesquine, elle est pauvre, elle est nulle. Elle n'exprime plus rien, pas même le souvenir de l'art d'un autre temps. Réduite à elle-même, abandonnée des autres arts parce que la pensée humaine l'abandonne, elle appelle des manoeuvres à défaut d'artistes. La vitre remplace le vitrail. Le tailleur de pierre succède au sculpteur. Adieu toute sève, toute originalité, toute vie, toute intelligence. Elle se traîne, lamentable mendiante d'atelier, de copie en copie. Michel-Ange, qui dès le seizième siècle la sentait sans doute mourir, avait eu une dernière idée, une idée de désespoir. Ce titan de l'art avait entassé le Panthéon sur le Parthénon, et fait Saint-Pierre de Rome. Grande oeuvre qui méritait de rester unique, dernière originalité de l'architecture, signature d'un artiste géant au bas du colossal registre de pierre qui se fermait. Michel-Ange mort, que fait cette misérable architecture qui se survivait à elle-même à l'état de spectre et d'ombre  ? Elle prend Saint-Pierre de Rome, et le calque, et le parodie. C'est une manie. C'est une pitié. Chaque siècle a son Saint-Pierre de Rome ; au dix-septième siècle le Val-de-Grâce, au dix-huitième Sainte-Geneviève. Chaque pays a son Saint-Pierre de Rome. Londres a le sien. Pétersbourg a le sien. Paris en a deux ou trois. Testament insignifiant, dernier radotage d'un grand art décrépit qui retombe en enfance avant de mourir. (Hugo and Chamarat, 1998)
	•	Si au lieu de monuments caractéristiques comme ceux dont nous venons de parler nous examinons l'aspect général de l'art du seizième au dix-huitième siècle, nous remarquons les mêmes phénomènes de décroissance et d'étisie. À partir de François II, la forme architecturale de l'édifice s'efface de plus en plus et laisse saillir la forme géométrique, comme la charpente osseuse d'un malade Les belles lignes de l'art font place aux froides et inexorables lignes du géomètre. Un édifice n'est plus un édifice, c'est un polyèdre. L'architecture cependant se tourmente pour cacher cette nudité. Voici le fronton grec qui s'inscrit dans le fronton romain et réciproquement. C'est toujours le Panthéon dans le Parthénon, Saint-Pierre de Rome. Voici les maisons de brique de Henri IV à coins de pierre ; la place Royale, la place Dauphine. Voici les églises de Louis XIII, lourdes, trapues, surbaissées, ramassées, chargées d'un dôme comme d'une bosse. Voici l'architecture mazarine, le mauvais pasticcio italien des Quatre-Nations. Voici les palais de Louis XIV, longues casernes à courtisans, roides, glaciales, ennuyeuses. Voici enfin Louis XV, avec les chicorées et les vermicelles, et toutes les verrues et tous les fungus qui défigurent cette vieille architecture caduque, édentée et coquette. De François II à Louis XV, le mal a crû en progression géométrique. L'art n'a plus que la peau sur les os. Il agonise misérablement. (Hugo and Chamarat, 1998)
	•	Cependant, que devient l'imprimerie  ? Toute cette vie qui s'en va de l'architecture vient chez elle. À mesure que l'architecture baisse, l'imprimerie s'enfle et grossit. Ce capital de forces que la pensée humaine dépensait en édifices, elle le dépense désormais en livres. Aussi dès le seizième siècle la presse, grandie au niveau de l'architecture décroissante, lutte avec elle et la tue. Au dix-septième, elle est déjà assez souveraine, assez triomphante, assez assise dans sa victoire pour donner au monde la fête d'un grand siècle littéraire. Au dix-huitième, longtemps reposée à la cour de Louis XIV, elle ressaisit la vieille épée de Luther, en arme Voltaire, et court, tumultueuse, à l'attaque de cette ancienne Europe dont elle a déjà tué l'expression architecturale. Au moment où le dix-huitième siècle s'achève, elle a tout détruit. Au dix-neuvième, elle va reconstruire. (Hugo and Chamarat, 1998)
	•	Or, nous le demandons maintenant, lequel des deux arts représente réellement depuis trois siècles la pensée humaine  ? lequel la traduit  ? lequel exprime, non pas seulement ses manies littéraires et scolastiques, mais son vaste, profond, universel mouvement  ?. Lequel se superpose constamment, sans rupture et sans lacune, au genre humain qui marche, monstre à mille pieds  ? L'architecture ou l'imprimerie  ?   L'imprimerie. Qu'on ne s'y trompe pas, l'architecture est morte, morte sans retour, tuée par le livre imprimé, tuée parce qu'elle dure moins, tuée parce qu'elle coûte plus cher. Toute cathédrale est un milliard. Qu'on se représente maintenant quelle mise de fonds il faudrait pour récrire le livre architectural ; pour faire fourmiller de nouveau sur le sol des milliers d'édifices ; pour revenir à ces époques où la foule des monuments était telle qu'au dire d'un témoin oculaire « on eût dit que le monde en se secouant avait rejeté ses vieux habillements pour se couvrir d'un blanc vêtement d'églises ». Erat enim ut si mundus, ipse excutiendo semet, rejecta vetustate, candidam ecclesiarum vestem indueret (GLABER RADULPHUS). (Hugo and Chamarat, 1998)
	•	Un livre est sitôt fait, coûte si peu, et peut aller si loin  ! Comment s'étonner que toute la pensée humaine s'écoule par cette pente  ? Ce n'est pas à dire que l'architecture n'aura pas encore çà et là un beau monument, un chef-d'oeuvre isolé. On pourra bien encore avoir de temps en temps, sous le règne de l'imprimerie, une colonne faite, je suppose, par toute une armée, avec des canons amalgamés, comme on avait, sous le règne de l'architecture, des Iliades et des Romanceros, des Mahabâhrata et des Niebelungen, faits par tout un peuple avec des rapsodies amoncelées et fondues. Le grand accident d'un architecte de génie pourra survenir au vingtième siècle, comme celui de Dante au treizième. Mais l'architecture ne sera plus l'art social, l'art collectif, l'art dominant. Le grand poème, le grand édifice, le grand oeuvre de l'humanité ne se bâtira plus, il s'imprimera. (Hugo and Chamarat, 1998)
	•	Et désormais, si l'architecture se relève accidentellement, elle ne sera plus maîtresse. Elle subira la loi de la littérature qui la recevait d'elle autrefois. Les positions respectives des deux arts seront interverties. Il est certain que dans l'époque architecturale les poèmes, rares, il est vrai, ressemblent aux monuments. Dans l'Inde, Vyasa est touffu, étrange, impénétrable comme une pagode. Dans l'orient égyptien, la poésie a, comme les édifices, la grandeur et la tranquillité des lignes ; dans la Grèce antique, la beauté, la sérénité, le calme ; dans l'Europe chrétienne, la majesté catholique, la naïveté populaire, la riche et luxuriante végétation d'une époque de renouvellement. La Bible ressemble aux Pyramides, l'Iliade au Parthénon, Homère à Phidias. Dante au treizième siècle, c'est la dernière église romane ; Shakespeare au seizième, la dernière cathédrale gothique. (Hugo and Chamarat, 1998)
	•	Ainsi, pour résumer ce que nous avons dit jusqu'ici d'une façon nécessairement incomplète et tronquée, le genre humain a deux livres, deux registres, deux testaments, la maçonnerie et l'imprimerie, la bible de pierre et la bible de papier. Sans doute, quand on contemple ces deux bibles si largement ouvertes dans les siècles, il est permis de regretter la majesté visible de l'écriture de granit, ces gigantesques alphabets formulés en colonnades, en pylônes, en obélisques, ces espèces de montagnes humaines qui couvrent le monde et le passé depuis la pyramide jusqu'au clocher, de Chéops à Strasbourg. Il faut relire le passé sur ces pages de marbre. Il faut admirer et refeuilleter sans cesse le livre écrit par l'architecture ; mais il ne faut pas nier la grandeur de l'édifice qu'élève à son tour l'imprimerie. (Hugo and Chamarat, 1998)
	•	Cet édifice est colossal. Je ne sais quel faiseur de statistique a calculé qu'en superposant l'un à l'autre tous les volumes sortis de la presse depuis Gutenberg on comblerait l'intervalle de la terre à la lune ; mais ce n'est pas de cette sorte de grandeur que nous voulons parler. Cependant, quand on cherche à recueillir dans sa pensée une image totale de l'ensemble des produits de l'imprimerie jusqu'à nos jours, cet ensemble ne nous apparaît-il pas comme une immense construction, appuyée sur le monde entier, à laquelle l'humanité travaille sans relâche, et dont la tête monstrueuse se perd dans les brumes profondes de l'avenir  ? C'est la fourmilière des intelligences. C'est la ruche où toutes les imaginations, ces abeilles dorées, arrivent avec leur miel. L'édifice a mille étages, Çà et là, on voit déboucher sur ses rampes les cavernes ténébreuses de la science qui s'entrecoupent dans ses entrailles. Partout sur sa surface l'art fait luxurier à l'oeil ses arabesques, ses rosaces et ses dentelles. Là chaque oeuvre individuelle, si capricieuse et si isolée qu'elle semble, a sa place et sa saillie. L'harmonie résulte du tout. Depuis la cathédrale de Shakespeare jusqu'à la mosquée de Byron, mille clochetons s'encombrent pêle-mêle sur cette métropole de la pensée universelle. À sa base, on a récrit quelques anciens titres de l'humanité que l'architecture n'avait pas enregistrés. À gauche de l'entrée, on a scellé le vieux bas-relief en marbre blanc d'Homère, à droite la Bible polyglotte dresse ses sept têtes. L'hydre du Romancero se hérisse plus loin, et quelques autres formes hybrides, les Védas et les Niebelungen. Du reste le prodigieux édifice demeure toujours inachevé. La presse, cette machine géante, qui pompe sans relâche toute la sève intellectuelle de la société, vomit incessamment de nouveaux matériaux pour son oeuvre. Le genre humain tout entier est sur l'échafaudage. Chaque esprit est maçon. Le plus humble bouche son trou ou met sa pierre. Rétif de la Bretonne apporte sa hottée de plâtras. Tous les jours une nouvelle assise s'élève. Indépendamment du versement original et individuel de chaque écrivain, il y a des contingents collectifs. Le dix-huitième siècle donne l'Encyclopédie, la révolution donne le Moniteur. Certes, c'est là aussi une construction qui grandit et s'amoncelle en spirales sans fin ; là aussi il y a confusion des langues, activité incessante, labeur infatigable, concours acharné de l'humanité tout entière, refuge promis à l'intelligence contre un nouveau déluge, contre une submersion de barbares. C'est la seconde tour de Babel du genre humain. (Hugo and Chamarat, 1998)
Argumentation
Affirmation
	•	quand il s'agit de faire pénétrer des idées et des croyances dans l'esprit des foules—les théories sociales modernes, par exemple—les procédés des meneurs sont différents. Ils ont principalement recours à trois procédés très nets: l'affirmation, la répétition, la contagion. L'action en est assez lente, mais les effets de cette action une fois produits sont fort durables. (Lebon, 1895)
L'affirmation pure et simple, dégagée de tout raisonnement et de toute preuve, est un des plus sûrs moyens de faire pénétrer une idée dans l'esprit des foules. Plus l'affirmation est concise, plus elle est dépourvue de toute apparence de preuves et de démonstration, plus elle a d'autorité. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	L'affirmation n'a cependant d'influence réelle qu'à la condition d'être constamment répétée, et, le plus possible, dans les mêmes termes. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Cette puissance vient de ce que la chose répétée finit par s'incruster dans ces régions profondes de l'inconscient où s'élaborent les motifs de nos actions. Au bout de quelque temps, nous ne savons plus quel est l'auteur de l'assertion répétée, et nous finissons par y croire. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	L'affirmation et la répétition sont seules assez puissantes pour pouvoir se combattre. Lorsqu'une affirmation a été suffisamment répétée, et qu'il y a unanimité dans la répétition, comme cela est arrivé pour certaines entreprises financières célèbres assez riches pour acheter tous les concours, il se forme ce qu'on appelle un courant d'opinion et le puissant mécanisme de la contagion intervient. (Lebon, 1895)
Armed forces
	•	Countries maintain armed forces because they may one day, by choice or by necessity, go to war to acieve their political objective – above all, the security of a country from outside attack. (Frühling, 2014)
Arms race
	•	"arms race" is in fact only "the arming of the race "toward the end of the world as distance, in other words as a field of action. (Virilio, 2006)
	•	Co-evolution is one of the major mechanisms for generating non-linear interactions between complex adaptive systems (CAS) agents. ‘Arms races’, be they between countries or organisms, provide a simple example. (Holland, 2014)
	•	Analogous situations occur between competing suppliers for production lines, arms races between nations, and other sets of co-evolving CAS agents. (Holland, 2014)
Army
	•	In military history, we can identify two types of armies—those that fight for a cause or an idea, and those that fight largely for money, as part of a job. Those that go to war for a cause, such as the armies of Napoleon Bonaparte fighting to spread the French Revolution, fight with greater intensity. They tie their individual fate to that of the cause and the nation. They are more willing to die in battle for the cause. Those in the army who are less enthusiastic get swept up in the group spirit. The general can ask more of his soldiers. The battalions are more unified, and the various battalion leaders are more creative. Fighting for a cause is known as a force multiplier—the greater the connection to the cause, the higher the morale, which translates into greater force. Such an army can often defeat one that is much larger but less motivated. (Greene, 2018)
Aristocracy
	•	aristocracy began to give way to technocracy as a strategy of rule. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
Arrogance of technical expertise
	•	Faced with public opposition to the results of risk-based decision making, many experts responded with open contempt toward the public perception of risk.' For them, perceived risk is correlated with false understanding and is further contrasted with real risk, which is allegedly an objective—that is, "true"—account of reality. (Leiss, 1996)
	•	Partly as a result of the arrogance of expertise, there exists on the part of the public a profound distrust of experts and the institutions they represent, which weakens the force of the quite sensible contributions that technical experts can make to the public discourse on risk taking. (Leiss, 1996)
	•	critical data gaps and ever changing scientific research results are common in all significant risk management areas; the uncertainties introduced thereby produce legitimate concerns when yes/no decisions must be made. (Leiss, 1996)
Art
	•	In arts, someone establishes a style that is new and vibrant, speaking to the particular spirit of the times. It has an edge because it is so different. Soon imitators pop up everywhere It becomes a fasion, something to coform to, even if the conformity appears to be rebellious and edgy. This can drag on for ten, twenty years; it eventually becomes a cliché, pure style without any real emotion or need. Nothing in culture escapes this deadening dynamics. (Greene, 2014)
	•	We may not be aware of it, but we suffer from the dead forms and conventions that clutter our culture. This problem, however, sets up a tremendous opportunity for creative type. (Greene, 2014)
Islamic art
	•	Islamic art is famous for its use of symmetric designs, such as those found in the Alhambra, a former fortress and palace in Grenada, Spain that dates to the 14th century; see Figure 10. The building itself is not designed to a systematic plan, but it is decorated with a great many tiling patterns. There are seventeen distinct symmetry types of lattice pattern (Chapter 4), and it is often said that all of them exist in the Alhambra. (Stewart, 2013)
Artist
	•	To be artistic means to pursue truth by creative responses to unique, if generically familiar, challenges. (Gray, 2014)
	•	Artists may behave systematically, but they are likely to rewrite theory to suit the circumstances and their imagination. (Gray, 2014)
As low as reasonably practicable (ALARP principle) 
	•	Above a certain level, a risk is regarded as intolerable and cannot be justified in any ordinary circumstances. Below such levels, an activity is allowed to take place provided that the associated risks have been made as low as reasonably practicable. In pursuing any further safety improvements to demonstrate ALARP account can be taken of cost. It is in principle possible to apply formal cost-benefit techniques to assist in making judgements of this kind. (Great Britain and Health and Safety Executive, 1992)
	•	In weighing the costs of extra safety measures the principle of reasonable practicability (ALARP) applies in such a way that the higher or more unacceptable a risk is, the more, proportionately, employers are expected to spend to reduce it. At the point just below the limit of tolerability (see Figure 3) they are, in fact, expected to spend up to the point where further expenditure would be grossly disproportionate to the risk; and as the risk will by definition be substantial, that implies a considerable effort even to achieve a marginal reduction. There may however come a point where in the existing state of technology even a marginal further reduction would be unjustifiably expensive and at that point the obligation to do better if reasonably practicable is discharged. (Great Britain and Health and Safety Executive, 1992)
	•	Where the risks are less significant, the less, proportionately, it is worth spending to reduce them and at the lower end of the zone it may not be worth spending anything at all. Below this region the levels of risk are so insignificant that they need not claim attention, and the regulator need not ask employers to seek further improvement provided that they are satisfied that these low levels of risk will be attained in practice. Nevertheless employers might decide to spend even more, and some do.
	•	The lower limit of the 'broadly acceptable' region in Figure 3 is set by the point at which the risk becomes truly negligible in comparison with other risks that the individual or society runs. (Great Britain and Health and Safety Executive, 1992)
	•	In practice, as technology improves it becomespossibletobeconfidentthatanynew plant can be designed to meet a level of risk that is well below the level that would be regarded as intolerable by comparison with other risks, though it may still be in the region where further effort should be made if this is reasonably practicable. (Great Britain and Health and Safety Executive, 1992)
	•	Such procedures accord with common sense. They recognise that not everything can be measured to the greatest degree of accuracy. They implicitly say that where a risk can be quantified, a definite standard of performance should be fixed. They recognise that measurement is not always possible, and that therefore expert assessment or judgement is called for. (Great Britain and Health and Safety Executive, 1992)
	•	Decisions on whether risks are ALARP are in most cases determined by adherence, as a minimum, to authoritative good practice. (McQuaid, 2007)
	•	The ALARP principle is central to consideration of how far it is necessary to go in pursuing risk reduction. The duty to demonstrate that risks are ALARP amounts to having to argue the case for the safety of the measures in place in terms of the residual risks. Where hazards are low and authoritative good prac- tice applies, the argument will be short and to the point. (McQuaid, 2007)
	•	The emphasis in applying the ALARP principle is on weighing up the options for improvement in safety. This process is more judgemental than deterministic, though with the caveat that the reasoning behind the judgements needs to be made explicit and transparent to others. The consequence is that the risk-based approach provides a mechanism for constructive dialogue between the regulator and the regulated, (McQuaid, 2007)
	•	Ideally, we would seek to control intolerable risks until the residual risk is tolerable. Sometimes the controls would be impractical or unjustifiably burdensome, in which case risk mangers might accept a residual risk level that is higher than the tolerability level. If so, on practical grounds, they would effectively tolerate a level of risk that they would not tolerate otherwise. This level is described sometimes as the ALARP (as low as reasonably practical) level. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	[…] the ALARP level could be used unscrupulously to justify a multitude of sins, such as laziness or meanness, but ALAPR levels are everywhere, even though most are unadmitted. (Newsome, 2013)
Asset
	•	Assets include people, property, and information. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	Assets are the items considered valuable by the organization. (Landoll, 2011)
	•	Assets are an important element of a security risk assessment for several reasons. (Landoll, 2011)
Critical assests
	•	Critical assets are necessary for the organization to carry out its mission, for without them, functions and processes will fail and cause the mission to fail. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	Critical assets are typically determined through interviews and questionnaires of the people charged with carrying out the organization’s mission. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	When determining the criticality of an asset, it is important to consider the time and money needed to replace the asset. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	Critical asset lists are normally easily attainable from completed risk assessment reports, as is the location of vital records. (Vellani, 2007)
Asset knowledge
	•	Asset knowledge is critical to adversaries, and moving targets are more dif- ficult to attack successfully. (Vellani, 2007)
Assimilation
	•	Assimilation refers to the absorption of new components into the identity structure (Breakwell, 2014)
Assessment
Realistic assessment
	•	Remember that greater control over events will come from realistic assessments of the situation, precisely what is made most difficult by a brain submerged in trivia. (Greene, 2018)
Association of ideas
	•	The essential feature of this complex set of mental events is its coherence. Each element is connected, and each supports and strengthens the others. The word evokes memories, which evoke emotions, which in turn evoke facial expressions and other reactions, such as a general tensing up and an avoidance tendency. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	happens quickly and all at once, yielding a self-reinforcing pattern of cognitive, emotional, and physical responses that is both diverse and integrated—it has been called associatively coherent. (Kahneman, 2012) 
	•	The mechanism that causes these mental events has been known for a long time: it is the association of ideas. We all understand from experience that ideas follow each other in our conscious mind in a fairly orderly way. (Kahneman, 2012)  
	•	An essential design feature of the associative machine is that it represents only activated ideas. (Kahneman, 2012)  
	•	The associative machine is set to suppress doubt and to evoke ideas and information that are compatible with the currently dominant story. (Kahneman, 2012)  
Associative memory
	•	Psychologists think of ideas as nodes in a vast network, called associative memory, in which each idea is linked to many others. There are different types of links: causes are linked to their effects (virus cold); things to their properties (lime green); things to the categories to which they belong (banana fruit). (Kahneman, 2012)  
	•	An idea that has been activated does not merely evoke one other idea. It activates many ideas, which in turn activate others. (Kahneman, 2012)  
	•	associative memory also generates subjectively compelling intuitions that are false. (Kahneman, 2012)  
	•	Associative memory contains a representation of the normal world and its rules. (Kahneman, 2012)  
Assumption
	•	Assumptions that do not associate with probabilities create a false sense of certainty. (Serrat, 2017)

Key assumption
	•	A key assumption is any hypothesis that analysts have accepted to be true and which forms the basis of the assessment. (US Government, 2009)

Athena
	•	Athena was the guiding spirit of Athens, the goddess of wisdom and practical intelligence. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Athena was literally born from the head of Zeus, her name itself reflecting this—a combination of “god” (theos) and “mind” (nous). But Athena came to represent a very particular form of nous—eminently practical, feminine, and earthy. She is the voice that comes to heroes in times of need, instilling in them a calm spirit, orienting their minds toward the perfect idea for victory and success, then giving them the energy to achieve this. (Greene, 2018)
	•	To be visited by Athena was the highest blessing of them all, and it was her spirit that guided great generals and the best artists, inventors, and tradesmen. Under her influence, a man or woman could see the world with perfect clarity and hit upon the action that was just right for the moment. For Athens, her spirit was invoked to unify the city, make it prosperous and productive. In essence, Athena stood for rationality, the greatest gift of the gods to mortals, for it alone could make a human act with divine wisdom. (Greene, 2018)
Athens
	•	Sparta was Athens’s archenemy and in many ways its polar opposite. Athens led a league of democratic states in the region, while Sparta led a confederation of oligarchies, known as the Peloponnesians. Athens depended on its navy and on its wealth—it was the preeminent commercial power in the Mediterranean. Sparta depended on its army. It was a total military state. Up until then, the two powers had largely avoided a direct war because the consequences could be devastating—not only could the defeated side lose its influence in the region, but its whole way of life could be put in jeopardy—certainly for Athens its democracy and its wealth. (Greene, 2018)
Attachment pattern
	•	There are, of course, many gradations within each type and combinations of them, but in every case the quality of attachment that we had in our earliest years will create deep tendencies within us, in particular the way we use relationships to handle or modulate our stress. (Greene, 2018)
Free/autonomous
	•	The free/autonomous stamp comes from mothers who give their children freedom to discover themselves and are continually sensitive to their needs but also protect them. (Greene, 2018)
Dismissing
	•	Dismissing mothers are often distant, even sometimes hostile and rejecting. Such children are stamped with a feeling of abandonment and the idea that they must continually fend for themselves. (Greene, 2018)
	•	children of the dismissing parent will tend to avoid any kind of negative emotional situation and to wall themselves off from feelings of dependency. They might find it harder to commit to a relationship or will unconsciously push people away. (Greene, 2018)
Enmeshed-ambivalent mothers
	•	The enmeshed-ambivalent mothers are not consistent with their attention—sometimes suffocating and overinvolved, other times retreating because of their own problems or anxieties. They can make their children feel as if they have to take care of the person who should be taking care of them. (Greene, 2018)
	•	The children of the enmeshed variety will experience a great deal of anxiety in relationships and will feel many conflicting emotions. They will always be ambivalent toward people, and this will set noticeable patterns in their life in which they pursue people and then unconsciously retreat. (Greene, 2018)
Disorganized mothers
	•	Disorganized mothers send highly conflicting signals to their children, reflecting their own inner chaos and perhaps early emotional traumas. Nothing their children do is right, and such children can develop powerful emotional problems. (Greene, 2018)
Attack
Attack cycle
	•	Some people refer to it as the “terrorist attack cycle” but I would argue that the same steps are also used by other violent actors as they plan an attack, regardless of their motivation. An unbalanced stalker, workplace attacker, school shooter or violent criminal will follow the same planning process, so I prefer to simply refer to it as the attack cycle. (Stewart, 2020)
	•	The attack cycle is an important concept because it provides a useful reference for investigating or analyzing past attacks. However, I believe its most important function is to provide a framework protective intelligence practitioners can use to understand, identify and detect behaviors associated with an imminent attack to prevent the attack from being launched. (Stewart, 2020)
	•	Once an attack is initiated, it is impossible to put the bullets back into a firearm or to turn back the blast wave and shrapnel of a bomb. It is always better to avoid or prevent an attack than it is to react to one. Looking for attack cycle behaviors is an important proactive tool in the protective intelligence kit. (Stewart, 2020)
	•	There are several variations of attack cycle models that tend to highlight different aspects of the cycle. Some insert multiple surveillance phases into the cycle or a final target selection phase, while others add a separate rehearsal or dry run phase. (Stewart, 2020)
	•	When it comes to applying the attack cycle, one of the mistakes I frequently see people make is attempting to apply it too rigidly to a specific attack. When the attack cycle is applied in this type of inflexible manner, there is a tendency to jump to the conclusion that the model does not work and then abandon it. To avoid this trap, it is important to think of the attack cycle as an elastic and general guideline for helping us understand the steps required to plan and execute an attack, as well as a helpful guide to help contextualize pre-attack behaviors. (Stewart, 2020)
	•	As we begin to apply the concept of the attack cycle to actual plots and attacks, it becomes readily apparent that there can be a great deal of variation in how the attack cycle is completed depending on the particular actor or actors involved, as well as their level of training, skill and tradecraft. For example, a complex terrorist organization with professional planners and dedicated surveillance and logistics cells will progress through the attack cycle in a different manner than will a lone assailant. However, despite these differences in how they accomplish the activities associated with the attack cycle, they will all nevertheless be bound to follow these general steps when conducting an attack. (Stewart, 2020)
Target Identification and Selection
	•	This is the step in the attack cycle when the type of target to be attacked is identified and a specific target to be attacked is then selected from a list of potential targets. (Stewart, 2020)
	•	By definition, intentional attacks must involve pre-selected targets. Because of this, it is not difficult to see how this phase of the attack cycle applies to all types of attackers. (Stewart, 2020)
	•	In the case of a stalker, target selection is the result of a fixation the attacker has with the target, and oftentimes this fixation develops long before the would-be-attacker develops a specific grievance or even begins to think about conducting an act of violence against the target. (Stewart, 2020)
	•	The targeting of people or groups of people the attacker has a grievance against also happens in most school shootings. The school itself and the students and faculty inside it are also sometimes selected as targets rather than specific people. (Stewart, 2020)
Surveillance
	•	some attack cycle models delineate specific surveillance phases. However, surveillance can and does occur throughout a large portion of the attack cycle from target selection and identification through the execution of the attack. I believe indicating that surveillance only occurs during certain phases of the cycle can be misleading and possibly harmful. (Stewart, 2020)
	•	The amount of surveillance required to select a target, plan an attack and launch the attack can depend considerably on the type of attacker, the type of attack and the target itself. In some cases, the surveillance can take weeks or even months. (Stewart, 2020)
	•	The amount of research and surveillance required during the attack cycle will also be different for an internal attacker as opposed to an external actor. Insiders have intimate knowledge of the layout of a targeted facility, as well as the security programs, policies and procedures in place. They also have natural cover for status and action as they conduct any additional surveillance required, giving them a distinct advantage over an outside attacker. (Stewart, 2020)
	•	Criminals, terrorists and other attackers often have very little in the way of surveillance training and tend to exhibit poor surveillance tradecraft and demeanor. This makes most attackers vulnerable to detection while conducting surveillance — but only if someone is looking for them. (Stewart, 2020)
	•	In addition to conducting physical surveillance of potential targets during the target selection and planning phases, attackers will often also conduct Internet research. This research can be as basic as compiling a list of potential targets in a city, or as detailed as obtaining building blueprints or combing through the social media of employees at the targeted facility to find photos of building access passes in order to make a counterfeit. (Stewart, 2020)
Planning and Preparation
	•	The planning and preparation phase of the attack cycle can also vary considerably depending on the actor involved and the type of attack being planned. Again, however, it is simply not possible to have an intentional attack without at least some degree of pre-attack planning and preparation. This phase not only includes developing the attack plan, but also a number of preparatory steps such as acquiring weapons and other materials required for the attack, training, rehearsals or dry runs, etc. This stage can also include additional surveillance if that is required to establish the pattern of the target for an assassination or kidnapping, or to answer specific questions the planner may have about security measures at the target. For example, the number of guards, their deterrent capability, types of locks on doors, CCTV coverage and the like. (Stewart, 2020)
	•	Of course, not every attack will take months or years to plan and prepare for. At the other end of the spectrum, a  lone attacker who decides to conduct a Molotov cocktail attack against a particular building may be able to plan such an attack in only a few hours and obtain the materials he needs to construct the incendiary device in his own garage. (Stewart, 2020)
Deployment 
	•	Deployment means getting the attacker or attack team and their weapons the attack site so the attack can be conducted. (Stewart, 2020)
Escape, Suicide or Survive
	•	Some have argued that the escape step in the attack cycle is no longer relevant in the post-9/11 world, but I disagree. (Stewart, 2020)
Exploitation
	•	In the case of a kidnapping or a bank robbery, the exploitation is more about spending the ill-gotten proceeds of the violent crime. But in cases of armed assaults, assassinations or bombings, it is more about promoting the attack as “propaganda of the deed.” (Stewart, 2020)
	•	In the early days of terrorism, the exploitation phase depended on media exposure and it is no mistake that the rise of terrorism paralleled the development of mass distribution newspapers, and telegraphs to transmit news nationally and internationally. More recently, the Internet, and social media in particular, has provided attackers the opportunity to become their own media, and we have even seen jihadist attackers in France and white supremacists in New Zealand and the United State livestream their attacks. (Stewart, 2020)
	•	Even in cases where the attacker commits suicide or is killed by police, they often leave written or video statements they intend to be used to promote the cause that motivated them to conduct their attacks. (Stewart, 2020)
	•	Even when an attacker doesn’t seek to actively exploit the attack themselves, they can still become criminal celebrities who can be idolized by other troubled souls. (Stewart, 2020)
Attack prediction
	•	Although an attack too often cannot be predicted with certainty since the enemy’s intentions remain vague, the alarm bells should go off in light of the unambiguous tactical information. (Honig, 2007)
Attack warning
	•	In attack warning, there is the problem of “noise” and deception. (Betts, 2007)
Intentional attacks 
	•	By definition, intentional attacks must involve pre-selected targets. (Stewart, 2020)
	•	it is simply not possible to have an intentional attack without at least some degree of pre-attack planning and preparation. (Stewart, 2020)
Surprise attack
	•	The 11 September 2001 attacks on New York City and Washington, D.C. have reinforced what has become an academic consensus based on more than fifteen cases of surprise attack after World War II—namely, that surprise attacks are almost inevitable. (Honig, 2007)
	•	A surprise attack is ‘‘a crossing of interstate lines against the victim’s expectations’. (Honig, 2007)
	•	the existing literature essentially presents a long list of causes for surprise attack, which together make it an almost inevitable outcome. (Honig, 2007)
	•	The Orthodox School asserts that surprise attacks are inevitable due to the inherent limits of the intelligence process. (Honig, 2007)
	•	The Orthodox School argues that surprise is almost certain, even in caseswhere ample warning information is available, or, in Betts’s words, surprise occurs ‘‘despite warning.’’ (Honig, 2007)
	•	The terrorism expert Jessica Stern puts it this way: ‘‘Surprise attacks do not arise from too little information too late, but from too much information, too soon.’ (Dahl, 2013)
	•	preventing surprise attacks depends largely on the ability of analysts and policymakers to understand and connect the available signals and warnings. (Dahl, 2013)
	•	The study of surprise attack burgeoned in the 1980s, as scholars developed theo- ries to explain not only Pearl Harbor but also disasters such as the American intelligence failures in the Korean War and the Israeli surprise in the 1973 Yom Kippur War. (Dahl, 2013)
	•	many national security and intelligence experts argue that the problem of surprise attack is indeed still with us. (Dahl, 2013)
	•	Although surprise attacks may be the most disastrous type of intelligence failure, they are only part of a broader category of failure described as strategic surprise. (Dahl, 2013)
	•	surprise attacks, even when they have strategic-level consequences, are essentially tactical events, involving relatively few decision makers and occurring in a relatively confined space and time. (Dahl, 2013)
	•	Surprise attacks can be made least likely by overinsurance in force levels or very high levels of readiness; both are extremely expensive and neither is palatable. (Hopple, 1984)
Attenuation of risk
	•	attenuation of risk is indispensable in that it allows individuals to cope with the multitude of risks and risk events encountered daily, it also may lead to potentially serious adverse consequences from under- estimation and under response. (Kasperson et al., 1988)
	•	amplification and attenuation, through serious disjunctures between expert and public assessments of risk and varying responses among different publics, confound conventional risk analysis. (Kasperson et al., 1988)
	•	Amplification/attenuation produces representation of the risk event. The framework is not concerned with evaluating whether these representations are right or distorted. The representations once generated are the functional reality. (Breakwell, 2014)
Attention
	•	If we experience success in our lives, we become addicted to positive attention, and in the inevitable down moments when the drug of such attention wears off, the Shadow will be disturbed and activated.  (Greene, 2018)
Attitude
	•	Each of us has a particular way of looking at the world, of interpreting events and the actions of people around us. This is our attitude, and it determines much of what happens to us in life. (Greene, 2018)
	•	The human attitude, however, is malleable. By making our attitude more positive, open, and tolerant of other people, we can spark a different dynamic—we can learn from adversity, create opportunities out of nothing, and draw people to us. We must explore the limits of our willpower and how far it can take us. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Each of us sees the world through a particular lens that colors and shapes our perceptions. Let us call this lens our attitude. (Greene, 2018)
	•	The great Swiss psychologist Carl Jung defined this in the following way: “Attitude is a readiness of the psyche to act or react in a certain way. . . . To have an attitude means to be ready for something definite, even though this something is unconscious; for having an attitude is synonymous with an a priori orientation to a definite thing.” (Greene, 2018)
	•	We are never conscious of this process. We merely experience the aftereffects of these sensitivities and firings of the brain; they add up to an overall mood or emotional background that we might call depression, hostility, insecurity, enthusiasm, or adventurousness. We experience many different moods, but in an overall sense we can say that we have a particular way of seeing and interpreting the world, dominated by one emotion or a blend of several, such as hostility and resentment. This is our attitude. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Each person sees and responds to the same brook differently, according to their particular attitude—adventurous, fearful, et cetera. (Greene, 2018)
	•	The attitude that we carry with us throughout life has several roots: First, we come into this world with certain genetic inclinations— toward hostility, greed, empathy, or kindness. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Second, our earliest experiences and attachment schemas (see chapter 4) play a large role in shaping the attitude. We internalize the voices of the mother and father figure. If they were very authoritarian and judgmental, we will tend to be harsher on ourselves than others and have a more critical bent toward everything we see. Equally important are the experiences we have outside the family, as we get older. When we love or admire someone, we tend to internalize a part of their presence, and they shape how we see the world in a positive way. This could be teachers, mentors, or peers. Negative and traumatic experiences can have a constricting effect—they close our minds off to anything that might possibly make us reexperience the original pain. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Our attitude is constantly being shaped by what happens to us, but vestiges of our earliest attitude always live on. No matter how far he progressed, Chekhov remained susceptible to feelings of depression and self-loathing. (Greene, 2018)
	•	What we must understand about the attitude is not only how it colors our perceptions but also how it actively determines what happens to us in life—our health, our relations with people, and our success. Our attitude has a self-fulfilling dynamic. (Greene, 2018)
	•	lthough attitudes come in many varieties and blends, we can generally categorize them as negative and narrow or positive and expansive. Depressive attitude
	•	People with a largely depressive attitude can feel moments of joy, but they are more disposed toward experiencing sadness; they anticipate the feeling in their day-to-day encounters. (Greene, 2018)
	•	His insecurities can also push people away. The way we think about people tends to have a like effect upon them. If we feel hostile and critical, we tend to inspire critical emotions in other people. If we feel defensive, we make others feel defensive. The attitude of the young man tends to lock him into this negative dynamic. (Greene, 2018)
	•	If the attitude is like our lens on the world, the negative attitude narrows the aperture of this lens, and the positive variety expands it as far as possible. We might move between these two poles, but generally we tend to see the world with a more closed or open lens. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Once you have a good feel for the makeup of your own attitude, its negative or positive bent, you have much greater power to alter it, to move it more in the positive direction. (Greene, 2018)
	•	you must not only be aware of the role of your attitude but also believe in its supreme power to alter your circumstances. You are not a pawn in a game controlled by others; you are an active player who can move the pieces at will and even rewrite the rules. (Greene, 2018)
	•	This seems obvious to us now, but such an organic way of thinking has great application to our psychological health as well. Now more than ever people focus on their specific problems—their depression, their lack of motivation, their social inadequacies, their boredom. But what governs all of these seemingly separate problems is our attitude, how we view the world on a daily basis. It is how we see and interpret events. Improve the overall attitude and everything else will elevate as well—creative powers, the ability to handle stress, confidence levels, relationships with people. (Greene, 2018)
	•	A negative, constricting attitude is designed to narrow down the richness of life at the cost of our creative powers, our sense of fulfillment, our social pleasures, and our vital energies. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Our life inevitably involves obstacles, frustrations, pain, and separations. How we come to handle such moments in our early years plays a large role in the development of our overall attitude toward life. (Greene, 2018)
	•	we must recognize the role that willpower plays in our health. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Our attitude plays an enormous role in our health, one that science has begun to explore and will examine in more depth in the coming decades. In general, you can safely push yourself beyond what you think are your physical limits by feeling excited and challenged by a project or endeavor. (Greene, 2018)
	•	hink of the modern concept of attitude in terms of the ancient concept of the soul. (Greene, 2018)
Avoidant attitude
	•	People with this attitude see the world through the lens of their insecurities, generally related to doubts about their competence and intelligence. Perhaps as children they were made to feel guilty and uncomfortable with any efforts to excel and stand out from siblings; or they were made to feel bad about any kind of mistake or possible misbehavior. What they came to dread most was the judgment of their parents. As these people get older, their main goal in life is to avoid any kind of responsibility or challenge in which their self-esteem might be at stake and for which they can be judged. If they do not try too hard in life, they cannot fail or be criticized. (Greene, 2018)
	•	To enact this strategy they will constantly seek escape routes, consciously or unconsciously. They will find the perfect reason for leaving a job early and changing careers, or breaking off a relationship. In the middle of some high-stakes project they will suddenly develop an illness that will cause them to leave. They are prone to all kinds of psychosomatic maladies. Or they become alcoholics, addicts of some sort, always falling off the wagon at the right time but blaming this on the “disease” they have, and their bad upbringing that caused their addiction. If it weren’t for alcohol, they could’ve been a great writer or entrepreneur, so they say. Other strategies will include wasting time and starting too late on something, always with some built-in excuse for why that happened. They then cannot be blamed for the mediocre results. (Greene, 2018)
	•	These types find it hard to commit to anything, for a good reason. If they remained at a job or in a relationship, their flaws might become too apparent to others. Better to slip away at the right moment and maintain the illusion—to themselves and to others—of their possible greatness, if only . . . Although they are generally motivated by the great fear of failing and the judgments that ensue, they are also secretly afraid of success—for with success come responsibilities and the need to live up to them. Success might also trigger their early fears about standing out and excelling. (Greene, 2018)
	•	You can easily recognize such people by their checkered careers and their short-term personal relationships. They may try to disguise the source of their problems by seeming saintly—they look down on success and people who have to prove themselves. Often they will present themselves as noble idealists, propagating ideas that will never come to pass but that will add to the saintly aura they wish to project. Having to enact ideals might expose them to criticism or failure, so they choose those that are too lofty and unrealistic for the times they live in. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Do not be fooled by the holier-than-thou front they present. Look at their actions, the lack of accomplishments, the great projects they never start on, always with a good excuse. (Greene, 2018)
	•	If you notice traces of this attitude in yourself, a good strategy is to take on a project of even the smallest scale, taking it all the way to completion and embracing the prospect of failure. If you fail, you will have already cushioned the blow because you anticipated it, and inevitably it will not hurt as much as you had imagined. Your self- esteem will rise because you finally tried something and finished it. Once you diminish this fear, progress will be easy. You will want to try again. And if you succeed, all the better. Either way, you win. (Greene, 2018)
	•	When you find others with this attitude, be very wary of forming partnerships with them. They are masters at slipping away at the wrong moment, at getting you to do all of the hard work and take the blame if it fails. At all costs avoid the temptation to help or rescue them from their negativity. They are too good at the avoidance game. (Greene, 2018)
Anxious attitude
	•	These types anticipate all kinds of obstacles and difficulties in any situation they face. With people, they often expect some sort of criticism or even betrayal. All of this stimulates unusual amounts of anxiety before the fact. What they really fear is losing control of the situation. Their solution is to limit what can possibly happen, to narrow the world they deal with. This means limiting where they go and what they’ll attempt. (Greene, 2018)
	•	In a relationship, they will subtly dominate the domestic rituals and habits; they will seem brittle and demand extra careful attention. This will dissuade people from criticizing them. Everything must be on their terms. (Greene, 2018)
	•	At work they will be ferocious perfectionists and micromanagers, eventually sabotaging themselves by trying to keep on top of too many things. 
	•	Once outside their comfort zone—the home or the relationship they dominate—they become unusually fretful. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Sometimes they can disguise their need for control as a form of love and concern. (Greene, 2018)
	•	The mother was able to disguise her anxious attitude and need to dominate her son through her apparent love, transforming him into a helpless invalid. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Another disguise, similar to such love, is to seek to please and cajole people in order to disarm any possible unpredictable and unfriendly action. (Greene, 2018)
	•	If you notice such tendencies in yourself, the best antidote is to pour your energies into work. Focusing your attention outward into a project of some sort will have a calming effect. As long as you rein in your perfectionistic tendencies, you can channel your need to control into something productive. With people, try to slowly open yourself to their habits and pace of doing things, instead of the opposite. This can show you that you have nothing to fear by loosening control. Deliberately place yourself in the circumstances you most dread, discovering that your fears are grossly exaggerated. You are slowly introducing a bit of chaos into your overly ordered life. (Greene, 2018)
	•	In dealing with those with this attitude, try to not feel infected with their anxiety, and instead try to provide the soothing influence they so lacked in their earliest years. If you radiate calmness, your manner will have greater effect than your words. (Greene, 2018)
Depressive attitude
	•	A strategy they will employ throughout their lives is to temporarily withdraw from life and from people. This will feed their depression and also make it something they can manage to some extent, as opposed to traumatic experiences imposed upon them. (Greene, 2018)
	•	These types often have a secret need to wound others, encouraging behavior such as betrayal or criticism that will feed their depression. They will also sabotage themselves if they experience any kind of success, feeling deep down that they don’t deserve it. They will develop blocks in their work, or take criticism to mean they should not continue with their career. (Greene, 2018)
	•	 Depressive types can often attract people to them, because of their sensitive nature; they stimulate the desire to want to help them. But like von Bülow, they will start to criticize and wound the ones who wish to help, then withdraw again. This push and pull causes confusion, but once under their spell it is hard to disengage from them without feeling guilty. They have a gift for making other people feel depressed in their presence. This gives them more fuel to feed off. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Most of us have depressive tendencies and moments. The best way to handle them is to be aware of their necessity—they are our body’s and mind’s way of compelling us to slow down, to lower our energies and withdraw. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Depressive cycles can serve positive purposes. The solution is to realize their usefulness and temporary quality. The depression you feel today will not be with you in a week, and you can ride it out. If possible, find ways to elevate your energy level, which will physically help lift you out of the mood. (Greene, 2018)
	•	The best way to handle recurrent depression is to channel your energies into work, especially the arts. You are used to withdrawing and being alone; use such time to tap into your unconscious. Externalize your unusual sensitivity and your dark feelings into the work itself. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Never try to lift up depressive people by preaching to them about the wonderfulness of life. Instead, it is best to go along with their gloomy opinion of the world while subtly drawing them into positive experiences that can elevate their moods and energy without any direct appeal. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Depression and anxiety come from not being your complete self, from always playing a role. (Greene, 2018)
Fearful attitude
	•	If our attitude is essentially fearful, we see the negative in every circumstance. We stop ourselves from taking chances. We blame others for mistakes and fail to learn from them. (Greene, 2018)
Hostile attitude
	•	If we feel hostile or suspicious, we make others feel such emotions in our presence. We sabotage our career and relationships by unconsciously creating the circumstances we fear the most. (Greene, 2018)
Negative/Constricted attitude
	•	Those with a negative attitude tend to operate from a basic position of fear toward life. They unconsciously want to limit what they see and experience to give them more control. (Greene, 2018)
	•	If the attitude is like our lens on the world, the negative attitude narrows the aperture of this lens, and the positive variety expands it as far as possible. We might move between these two poles, but generally we tend to see the world with a more closed or open lens. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Life is inherently chaotic and unpredictable. The human animal, however, does not react well to uncertainty. People who feel particularly weak and vulnerable tend to adopt an attitude toward life that narrows what they experience so that they can reduce the possibility of unexpected events. This negative, narrowing attitude often has its origins in early childhood. Some children have little comfort or support in facing a frightening world. They develop various psychological strategies to constrict what they have to see and experience. They build up elaborate defenses to keep out other viewpoints. They become increasingly self-absorbed. In most situations they come to expect bad things to happen, and their goals in life revolve around anticipating and neutralizing bad experiences to better control them. As they get older, this attitude becomes more entrenched and narrower, making any kind of psychological growth nearly impossible. (Greene, 2018)
	•	These attitudes have a self-sabotaging dynamic. Such people make others feel the same negative emotion that dominates their attitude, which helps confirm them in their beliefs about people. They do not see the role that their own actions play, how they often are the instigators of the negative response. They only see people persecuting them, or bad luck overwhelming them. By pushing people away, they make it doubly hard to have any success in life, and in their isolation their attitude gets worse. They are caught in a vicious cycle. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Negative emotions have a binding power—a person who is angry is more prone to also feel suspicion, deep insecurities, resentment, et cetera. And so we often find combinations of these various negative attitudes, each one feeding and accentuating the other. (Greene, 2018)
	•	On the one side we find people whose goal in life is to inhibit and control this life force. This leads them to self-destructive strategies. They have to limit their thoughts and remain true to ideas that have lost their relevance. They have to limit what they experience. Everything is about them and their petty needs and personal problems. They often become obsessed with a particular goal that dominates all of their thoughts—such as making money or getting attention. All of this renders them dead inside as they close themselves off to the richness of life and the variety of human experience. In this way they veer toward the soulless, an internal lack of depth and flexibility. (Greene, 2018)
Positive attitude
	•	Those with a positive attitude have a much less fearful approach. They are open to new experiences, ideas, and emotions. (Greene, 2018)
	•	If the attitude is like our lens on the world, the negative attitude narrows the aperture of this lens, and the positive variety expands it as far as possible. We might move between these two poles, but generally we tend to see the world with a more closed or open lens. (Greene, 2018)
	•	See yourself as an explorer. With the gift of consciousness, you stand before a vast and unknown universe that we humans have just begun to investigate. (Greene, 2018)
	•	As an explorer you leave all that certainty behind you. You are in continual search of new ideas and new ways of thinking. You see no limits to where your mind can roam, and you are not concerned with suddenly appearing inconsistent or developing ideas that directly contradict what you believed a few months before. Ideas are things to play with. (Greene, 2018)
	•	You are returning to your childlike spirit and curiosity, from before you had an ego and being right was more important than connecting to the world. You explore all forms of knowledge, from all cultures and time periods. You want to be challenged.By opening the mind in this way, you will unleash unrealized creative powers, and you will give yourself great mental pleasure. (Greene, 2018)
Resentful Attitude
	•	As children, these types never felt they got enough parental love and affection—they were always greedy for more attention. They carry this sense of dissatisfaction and disappointment with them throughout their lives. They are never quite getting the recognition they deserve. They are experts at scanning people’s faces for signs of possible disrespect or disdain. They see everything in relation to themselves; if someone has more than they do, it is a sign of injustice, a personal affront. When they feel this lack of respect and recognition, they do not explode in anger. They are generally cautious and like to control their emotions. Instead, the hurt incubates inside them, the sense of injustice growing stronger as they reflect on this. They do not easily forget. At some point they will take their revenge in some shrewdly plotted act of sabotage or passive aggression. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Because they have a continual feeling of being wronged, they tend to project this on to the world, seeing oppressors everywhere. In this way, they often become the leader of those who feel disaffected and oppressed. If such types get power, they can become quite vicious and vengeful, finally able to vent their resentments on various victims. (Greene, 2018)
	•	In general, they carry themselves with an air of arrogance; they are above others even if no one recognizes this. They carry their head a little too high; they frequently have a slight smirk or look of disdain. As they get older, they are prone to pick petty battles, unable to completely contain their resentments that have accumulated over time. Their bitter attitude pushes a lot of people away, and so they often end up congregating with others who have this attitude, as their form of community. (Greene, 2018)
	•	If you notice resentful tendencies within yourself, the best antidote is to learn to let go of hurts and disappointments in life. It is better to explode into anger in the moment, even it if it’s irrational, than to stew on slights that you have probably hallucinated or exaggerated. (Greene, 2018)
	•	People are generally indifferent to your fate, not as antagonistic as you imagine. Very few of their actions are really directed at you. Stop seeing everything in personal terms. Respect is something that must be earned through your achievements, not something given to you simply for being human. You must break out of the resentful cycle by becoming more generous toward people and human nature. (Greene, 2018)
	•	In dealing with such types, you must exercise supreme caution. Although they might smile and seem pleasant, they are actually scrutinizing you for any possible insult. You can recognize them by their history of past battles and sudden breaks with people, as well as how easily they judge others. You might try to slowly gain their trust and lower their suspicions; but be aware that the longer you are around them, the more fuel you will give them for something to resent, and their response can be quite vicious. Better to avoid this type if possible. (Greene, 2018)
Suspicious attitude
	•	If we feel hostile or suspicious, we make others feel such emotions in our presence. We sabotage our career and relationships by unconsciously creating the circumstances we fear the most. (Greene, 2018)
Attraction
	•	On either end of the spectrum—attraction or repulsion—you will tend to be irrational and you will desperately need to distance yourself. A good strategy to utilize is to see through the front they project. They inevitably try to cast a larger-than-life image, a mythic, intimidating quality; but in fact they are all too human, full of the same insecurities and weaknesses we all possess. Try to recognize these very human traits and demythologize them. (Greene, 2018)

Attribution
	•	The first involves systematic assessment or manipulation of antecedents. There is no interest in consequences beyond the attributions themselves, and they are generally measured directly by verbal report. (Kelley and Michela, 1980)
Attractor
	•	If volumes in state space do not shrink in time there can be no attractors. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
Strange attractor
	•	The precise origin of the phrase ‘strange attractor’ has been lost, but the term has proven an inspiring and appropriate label for these objects of mathematical physics. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
Attributional research
	•	"Attributional" research conce s the consequences of attributions. It entails assessment or manipulation of perceived causes and measurement of their e ects on behavior, feelings, and expectancies. (Kelley and Michela, 1980)
	•	the attribution is affected by information, in this case, about the consequences of the action as these are compared with the consequences of other actions the actor might have taken. (Kelley and Michela, 1980)
	•	the attribution is affected by the perceiver's belief in this case, about what other actors would do in the same situation (social desirability). (Kelley and Michela, 1980)
Attribution theory
	•	Attribution theory is a useful framework for explaining the relation between a situation and the selection of communication strategies. (Coombs and Holladay, 1996)
	•	Research demonstrates that people search for causes of events in a variety of domains (Weiner, Perry, & Magnusson, 1988). (Coombs and Holladay, 1996)
	•	McAuley, Duncan and Russell (1992) identified four causal dimensions people might use when making attributions: stability, external control, personal control, and locus. Stability assesses if the event's cause happens frequently (stable) or infrequently (unstable). External control indicates whether or not the event's cause is controllable. Personal control assesses whether or not the event's cause is controllable by the actor. Locus reflects if the event's cause is something about the actor or something about the situation(McAuley et al.. 1992: Russell, 1982; Wilson et al., 1993). (Coombs and Holladay, 1996)
	•	Both personal control and locus reflect intentionality of an act. High personal control and a locus in the actor create perceptions of intentional actions while low personal control and a locus in the situation foster perceptions of unintentional action. (Coombs and Holladay, 1996)
	•	there are three causal dimensions: stability, external control, and locus/personal control (locus for short). (Coombs and Holladay, 1996)
	•	The judgments people make about these three causal dimensions influence their feelings and behaviors toward the actor (Weiner, 1985: Weiner et al., 1988; Wilson et al., 1993). (Coombs and Holladay, 1996)
	•	The explanations that actors offer for an event can affect people's attributions in two ways. First, the messages can shape how people perceive the three attribution dimensions. Second, the messages can affect the feelings created by the attributions (Weiner et al., 1988). (Coombs and Holladay, 1996)
	•	people evaluate organizational responsibility for a crisis when they determine the cause of a crisis. The more publics attribute crisis responsibility to an organization, the stronger the likelihood is of publics developing and acting upon negative images o f the organization. (Coombs and Holladay, 1996)
	•	The three causal dimensions of attribution should affect evaluations of organizational responsibility for a crisis in predictable ways. Organizational crisis responsibility should be perceived as strongest if the cause is stable (i.e., the organization has a history of crises), external control (controlled by others outside the organization) is low, and the locus is strongly internal (intentionality is high). When a crisis event is repeated (stable), publics are more likely to attribute responsibility to the organization. Attributions of low external control indicate that the crisis was not under the control of groups outside of the organization; thus, the crisis should not be attributed to external agents. Attributions that entail a strong internal locus/intentionality suggest that the organization could have done some- thing to prevent the crisis. Such attributions indicate that the organization could have prevented the crisis and knew that preventative measures could have been taken. (Coombs and Holladay, 1996)
	•	Organizational crisis responsibility should be weakest when attributions suggest the cause is unstable (i.e., the crisis is an exception in the organization's performance history), with strong external control and weak internal locus (low intentionality). Attributions reflecting strong external control and low intentionality (weak internal locus) suggest that factors outside the organization and its control are responsible for the crisis event. An unstable crisis creates weak attributions of organizational responsibility. Such conditions suggest that an organization was a victim of circumstances and could do little or nothing to prevent the crisis. (Coombs and Holladay, 1996)
	•	Neoinstitutionalism and attribution theory can be merged to form a symbolic approach to crisis management. (Coombs and Holladay, 1996)
	•	Neoinstitutionalism and attribution theory suggest three means by which crisis strategies might affect an organizational image: 1. Convince stakeholders there is no crisis.
2. Have stakeholders see the crisis as less negative.
3. Have stakeholders see the organization more positively. (Coombs and Holladay, 1996)
	•	The locus of causality concerns whether the cause resides within or is external to the attributor, whereas the stability dimension refers to whether the cause is invariant or changeable over time. Finally, the control dimension reflects whether the cause is controllable or uncontrollable. (McAuley et al., 1992)
	•	The study of perceived causation is identified by the term "attribution theory," attribution referring to the perception or inference of cause. (Kelley and Michela, 1980)
Causal attributions
	•	Causal attributions have been identified as playing an important role in such diverse behaviors as interpersonal relations (Fincham, Bradbury, & Grych, 1990), sport and physical activity (McAuley & Duncan, 1990a), interna- tional conflict (Betancourt, 1990), and health behaviors (Lewis & Daltroy, 1990; Michela & Wood, 1986). (McAuley et al., 1992)
	•	Weiner's (1985) model posits causal attributions to be of little importance in themselves but, rather, to influence behavior in terms of the causal dimensions or common properties underlying attributions. It is theorized that the effects of causal dimensions on behavior are mediated by future expectations and emotional reactions to achievement outcomes (Weiner, 1985). (McAuley et al., 1992)
	•	As considerable importance is placed on causal dimensions in the attribution-behavior link, it is of para- mount importance that we accurately measure these properties theorized to underlie causal attributions. (McAuley et al., 1992)
	•	The causal attributions made for an achievement outcome into causal dimensions, committing what Russell (1982) has called "the fundamental attribution researcher error" (i.e., making the assumption that the researcher per- ceives causes in the same way as the respondent) (McAuley et al., 1992)
	•	causal attributions are assumed to play a central role in human behavior. (Kelley and Michela, 1980)
Automated evolution
	•	Automated evolution is targeted, purposeful and intelligent and it is promis- ing to make life more complex still. In automated evolution technologies change as they learn. The algorithms do not remain the same. (Coker, 2009)
	•	if natural selection shows no evidence of intelligent design, automated evolution does. (Coker, 2009)
	•	Automated evolution is going to change history faster than ever by making it more complex still. (Coker, 2009)
Autopsy
	•	An autopsy—aka a postmortem examination—is a specialized surgical procedure conducted by a pathologist to thoroughly assess a corpse to determine or confirm the exact cause and circumstances of death or the character and extent of changes produced by disease. (Serrat, 2017)
Authoritarian person
	•	We can notice the following interesting phenomenon: people who are domineering often are extremely intolerant of any kind of dissent. They need to be surrounded by sycophants and constantly be reminded of their greatness and superiority. If such types have political power, they work to tamp down any negative publicity and control what people say about them. We must see this hypersensitivity to criticism as a sign of great inner weakness. A person who is truly strong from within can endure criticism and open discussion without feeling personally threatened. Generally, aggressors and authoritarian types are expert at concealing this profound inner weakness by constantly projecting toughness and conviction. But we must train ourselves to look past their façade and see the inner fragility. This can greatly help us control any feelings of fear or intimidation, which aggressors love to stimulate. (Greene, 2018)
Authority
	•	The authorities are those departments or persons assigned to determine how security and risk should be managed. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Although styles of leadership change with the times, one constant remains: people are always ambivalent about those in power. They want to be led but also to feel free; they want to be protected and enjoy prosperity without making sacrifices; they both worship the king and want to kill him. When you are the leader of a group, people are continually prepared to turn on you the moment you seem weak or experience a setback. Do not succumb to the prejudices of the times, imagining that what you need to do to gain their loyalty is to seem to be their equal or their friend; people will doubt your strength, become suspicious of your motives, and respond with hidden contempt. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Authority is the delicate art of creating the appearance of power, legitimacy, and fairness while getting people to identify with you as a leader who is in their service. If you want to lead, you must master this art from early on in your life. Once you have gained people’s trust, they will stand by you as their leader, no matter the bad circumstances. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Throughout history, however, certain notable leaders have been able to erect a bulwark against this volatility, to earn a type of solid respect and support that allowed them to accomplish great things over time. We think of Moses, or the ancient Indian emperor Asoka, or Pericles (see chapter 1), or the Roman general Scipio Africanus, or Queen Elizabeth I. In more modern times we can think of Abraham Lincoln, or Martin Luther King Jr., or Warren Buffett, or Angela Merkel, or Steve Jobs. We shall call such power authority, reverting to the original significance of the word, which comes from the Latin auctoritas, the root meaning “to increase or augment.” (Greene, 2018)
	•	To the ancient Romans, those who had founded their republic possessed tremendous wisdom. Their ancestors had demonstrated this wisdom by how strong and long-lasting were the institutions they had established, and how they had transformed their provincial town into the preeminent power in the known world. To the extent that Roman senators and leaders returned to this basic wisdom and embodied the ideals of the founders, they had authority—an augmented presence, an increased prestige and credibility. Such leaders did not have to resort to speeches or to force. Roman citizens willingly followed their lead and accepted their ideas or advice. Their every word and deed seemed to carry extra weight. This gave them greater leeway in making hard decisions; they were not judged merely by their latest success. (Greene, 2018)
	•	people generally don’t respect the ideas of those lower down in the hierarchy; the same ideas promulgated by a boss would have a different effect. But sometimes it could stem from your own actions, as you violate many of the principles described above. (Greene, 2018)
	•	you must not fall for the counterproductive prejudices of the times we live in, in which the very concept of authority is often misunderstood and despised. Today we confuse authority with leaders in general, and since so many of them in the world seem more interested in preserving their power and enriching themselves, naturally we have doubts about the very concept itself. We also live in fiercely democratic times. “Why should we ever have to follow a person of authority, and assume such an inferior role?” we might ask ourselves. “People in power should simply get the job done; authority is a relic of kings and queens. We have progressed far beyond that.” (Greene, 2018)
	•	This disdain for authority and leadership has filtered its way throughout our culture. We no longer recognize authority in the arts. Everyone is a legitimate critic, and standards should be personal— nobody’s taste or judgment should be seen as superior. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Without authority in the arts, there is nothing to rebel against, no prior movement to overturn, no deep thinking to assimilate and later even reject. (Greene, 2018)
	•	To acknowledge people of authority in the world is not an admission of our own inferiority but rather an acceptance of human nature and the need for such figures. People of authority should not be seen as self-serving or tyrannical—in fact, those are the qualities that diminish their authority. They are not relics of the past but people who fulfill a necessary function and whose style adapts with the times. Authority can be an eminently democratic phenomenon. We must realize that much of what is behind progressive ideas of consensus, the minimal leader, and the parent as friend, is actually a great fear ofresponsibility, of the tough choices that must be made, of standing out and taking the heat. We must move in the opposite direction, embracing the risks and dangers that come with leadership and authority. (Greene, 2018)
	•	In the world today, we humans have become more self-absorbed, more tribal and tenacious in holding on to our narrow agendas; we have become consumed by the barrage of information inundating us; we are even more fickle when it comes to leaders. And so the need for true figures of authority—with an elevated perspective, a high attunement to the group, and a feel for what unifies it—has never been greater. And because of that, we are tasked with establishing our authority and assuming such a necessary role. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Remember that the essence of authority is that people willingly follow your lead. They choose to adhere to your words and advice. They want your wisdom. Certainly at times you may have to use force, rewards and punishments, and inspiring speeches. It is only a matter of degree. The less your need of such devices, the greater your authority. And so you must think of continually striving to engage people’s willpower and overcome their natural resistances and ambivalence. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Those who maintain their presence of mind and elevate their perspective above the moment tap into the visionary powers of the human mind and cultivate that third eye for unseen forces and trends. They stand out from the group, fulfill the true function of leadership, and create the aura of authority by seeming to possess the godlike ability to read the future. And this is a power that can be practiced and developed and applied to any situation. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Equally important is to show some initial toughness; if people get the impression early on that they can maneuver you, they will do so mercilessly. You set limits that are fair. If members don’t rise to the high levels you uphold, you punish them. Your tone in speaking or writing is peremptory and bold. People always respect strength in the leader, as long as it does not stir up fears of the abuse of power. If such toughness is not natural to you, develop it, or you will not last very long in the position. You will always have plenty of time to reveal that softer, kinder side that is really you, but if you start soft, you signal that you are a pushover. (Greene, 2018)
	•	our authority will grow with each action that inspires trust and respect. It gives you the luxury to remain in power long enough to realize great projects. But as you get older, the authority you established can become rigid and stodgy. You become the father figure who starts to seem oppressive by how long he has monopolized power, no matter how deeply people admired him inthe past. A new generation inevitably emerges that is immune to your charm, to the aura you have created. They see you as a relic. You also have the tendency as you get older to become ever so slightly intolerant and tyrannical, as you cannot help but expect people to follow you. Without being aware, you start to feel entitled, and people sense this. Besides, the public wants newness and fresh faces. (Greene, 2018)
	•	En fait, le « grand homme » semble posséder un pouvoir attractif, émanant naturellement de sa personne, sorte de « rayonnement », que Le Bon baptisait « prestige » et que l’on a nommé, à la suite de Max Weber, le charisme. Il est commun depuis d’avoir du chef charismatique une représentation relevant des images d’Epinal. On le voit dressé au milieu de l’histoire de son peuple comme un Guide providentiel, figure de proue mystérieuse et inspirée : il s’avance auréolé de lumière, possédant des qualités quasi divines. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Pelz propose trois éléments permettant d’évaluer le pouvoir de superviseur : la capacité qu’il pense avoir d’agir sur les décisions de son supérieur, sa propre autonomie décisionnelle et son niveau de salaire. La combinaison de ces trois éléments fournissant la mesure de ce que l’auteur nomme l’« influence ». (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Quant aux apparents critères objectifs de l’investiture sociale (port de galons, décorations, bâton de commandement, siège et costume), ils sont des points de repère permettant la circulation des informations et décisions dans un groupe donné et réglant les rapports entre les différents membres, mais ils restent les témoins muets d’un phénomène psychosociologique dont ils ne nous disent rien. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	« d’ordinaire, l’autorité est pour nous un objet non de connaissance, mais d’appréciation, et, souvent, de réprobation ». (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	« le commandement n’est pas un attribut de la personnalité, mais une qualité particulière de son rôle au sein d’un système social défini ». (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	« un chef est une personne qui ne contrôle que certains types de situations sociales, en dehors desquelles il est relativement inefficace ». (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	L’accès au commandement est donc ouvert à celui qui, dans une situation donnée, possède le talent requis pour gérer cette situation. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	une fois que les événements ont fait élire un meneur, celui-ci doit tout de même faire preuve de certaines qualités personnelles : activité, mouvement, efficacité, suivant R.M. Stogdill (op. cit., p. 73). (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	la difficulté ne serait pas de trouver des chefs, mais de les placer dans les situations où ils pourront assurer un commandement. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	les traits de personnalité que possède le meneur ne feront de lui un chef que dans la mesure où les facteurs situationnels exigeront ce profil-là plutôt qu’un autre. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	dépend du chef, mais le chef ne peut pas commander n’importe quel groupe : son pouvoir lui vient, pour l’essentiel, des caractéristiques événementielles. (Mannoni, 1985)
Authority style
	•	Find your authority style: Authenticity. The authority you establish must emerge naturally from your character, from the particular strengths you possess. (Greene, 2018)
	•	By bringing out a style that is natural to you, you give the impression that it is something beyond you, as if your sense of justice or nose for trends came from your DNA or were a gift from the gods. (Greene, 2018)
	•	The earlier you recognize this style the better; you will have more time to hone it, to adapt it to changes in yourself and in the culture, to bring out new facets to impress and fascinate people. And having left signs of this style from the beginning of your career, it will seem all the more like a higher power that you cannot help but follow. (Greene, 2018)
Deliver
	•	A notable archetype is the Deliverer, such as Moses or Martin Luther King Jr., an individual determined to deliver people from evil. Deliverers have an acute dislike of any kind of injustice, particularly those that affect the group they identify with. They have so much conviction, and most often such a way with words, that people are drawn to them. (Greene, 2018)
Founder
	•	These are the ones who establish a new order in politics or business. They generally have a keen sense of trends and a great aversion to the status quo. They are unconventional and independent minded. Their greatest joy is to tinker and invent something new. Many people naturally rally to the side of Founders, because they represent some form of progress. (Greene, 2018)
Visionary Artist 
	•	the Visionary Artist, such as Pablo Picasso or the jazz artist John Coltrane or the film director David Lynch. These artists learn the conventions in their field and then turn them upside down. They crave some new style and they create it. With their skill, they always find an audience and followers. (Greene, 2018)
Truth Seeker 
	•	people who have no tolerance for lies and politicking. (Greene, 2018)
Quiet Pragmatist
	•	they want nothing more than to fix things that are broken, and have infinite patience. (Greene, 2018)
Healer 
	•	they have a knack for finding what will fulfill and unify people. (Greene, 2018)
Teacher
	•	they have a way of getting people to initiate action and learn from their mistakes. (Greene, 2018)
Inner authority
	•	The key to making the struggle between the two sides more even and to perhaps tip the scales toward the higher is to cultivate what we shall call the inner authority. It serves as the voice, the conscience of our higher self. This voice is already there; we hear it at times, but it is weak. We need to increase the frequency with which we hear it and its volume. Think of this voice as dictating a code of behavior, and every day we must make ourselves listen to it. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Feeling the higher self in ascendance, you can afford to indulge that lower self, to let it out at moments to release tension and not become aprisoner of your Shadow. And most important, you no longer need the comfort and guidance of a parent or leader. You have become your own mother and father, your own leader, truly independent and operating according to your inner authority. (Greene, 2018)
Pillars of authority
	•	When leaders fail to establish these twin pillars of authority—vision and empathy—what often happens is the following: Those in the group feel the disconnect and distance between them and leadership. They know that deep down they are viewed as replaceable pawns. They sense the overall lack of direction and the constant tactical reactions to events. And so, in subtle ways, they begin to feel resentful and to lose respect. They listen less attentively to what such leaders say. They spend more hours in the day thinking of their own interests and future. They join or form factions. They work at half or three-quarter speed. (Greene, 2018)
	•	If such leaders, sensing all of this, become more forceful and demanding, the members become more passive-aggressive. If the leaders become pliant and plead for more support, the members feel even less respect, as if the group were now leading the leader. In this way, the members create endless forms of friction for leaders, who might now feel like they have to drag the group up a hill. This friction, caused by their own inattentiveness, is why so many leaders get so little done and are so mediocre. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Without leaders who dedicate much mental energy to foreseeing trends and guiding us to long-term solutions, we are lost. And as this situation becomes the norm, because we humans have always needed some form of authority as a guide, we tend to fall for certain fake forms of authority that proliferate in times of chaos and uncertainty.  (Greene, 2018)
Disdain of authority 
	•	This disdain for authority and leadership has filtered its way throughout our culture. We no longer recognize authority in the arts. Everyone is a legitimate critic, and standards should be personal— nobody’s taste or judgment should be seen as superior. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Without leaders who dedicate much mental energy to foreseeing trends and guiding us to long-term solutions, we are lost. And as this situation becomes the norm, because we humans have always needed some form of authority as a guide, we tend to fall for certain fake forms of authority that proliferate in times of chaos and uncertainty.  (Greene, 2018)
Fake norms of authorities
	•	Without leaders who dedicate much mental energy to foreseeing trends and guiding us to long-term solutions, we are lost. And as this situation becomes the norm, because we humans have always needed some form of authority as a guide, we tend to fall for certain fake forms of authority that proliferate in times of chaos and uncertainty.This could be the strongman, who gives the illusion of leadership and direction but has no real vision of where to go, just ideas and actions that serve his ego and enhance his sense of control. This could be the panderer, the leader who cleverly mimics what the public wants to hear, creating the illusion of being sensitive to the group and giving it what it wants. This could be the chummy leader, who affects the style and mannerisms of everyone else, offering what seems to be the ultimate in fairness, fun, and consensus. This could also be the authority of the group, which becomes that much more powerful in the age of social media: what other people are saying and doing must be true and respected, by dint of sheer numbers. But all of these false forms only lead to more turmoil, chaos, and bad decisions. (Greene, 2018)
Availability bias
	•	The availability bias is easy to manipulate by officials, journalists and their editors, and entertainers – anybody with capacity to release striking images or conceptualizations to a mass audience. (Newsome, 2013)
Avarage
Sample-average 
	•	The average height taken over a sample of human beings is called the sample-average.  (Smith and Smith, 2007)
B
Balance doctrine 
	•	[…] a doctrine of ‘balance’, casting themselves in the role of maintaining a delicate equipoise among opposed policy considerations, with current public attitudes only one of the items to be balanced. (Hood et al., 2001)
Balance of power
	•	The idea that power operates on a regional scale is well known from the concept of a regional balance of power, in which powers that are not directly linked to each other still take part in the same network of relations. (Buzan and Wæver, 2003)
	•	The balance of power remained the principal concern of the Great Powers for almost a century, and the policy challenge for the liberal world was to form a coalition of like-minded societies against any country or combination of countries that challenged the liberal order. (Coker, 2009)
	•	Perceptions of the military balance are derived primarily from the statements of public officials. (Brown, 1983)
Banality
	•	The truth is that banality is part of human existence. (Greene, 2018)
Band wagon effect
	•	when problems are many and diverse, on any one of them the number of experts can be dangerously small, and individual even idiosyncratic views may pass unchallenged, or there may be a déformation professionelle, a tendency to look at things according to the conventions of one’s own specialization or profession, forgetting any broader point of view. (Omand, 2014)
	•	Psychologists recognize a well-known ‘band- wagon’ effect—the tendency to believe things because many other people do. (Omand, 2014)
Bank
Central bank
	•	Central banks worldwide require other banks to place a part of their deposits and debts with them, to create a buffer against liquidity shortages. In this sense, central banks ensure the stability of the banking system, thus avoiding liquidity shocks. The freezing of the interbank lending network was one of the first signals of the 2008 financial crisis. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
Banker
	•	un banquier, vous le savez, doit être esclave de sa parole. (Dumas, 1998)
Baffling interactions
	•	The notion of baffling interactions is increasingly familiar to all of us. It characterizes our social and political world as well as our technological and industrial world. As systems grow in size and in the number of diverse functions they serve, and are built to function in ever more hostile environments, increasing their ties to other systems, they experience more and more incomprehensible or unexpected interactions. They become more vulnerable to unavoidable system accidents. (Perrow, 1999)
Base-reta neglect
	•	Worse, most people are naturally underempirical: They react to the most available and proximate events rather than check the longer-term rate or trend. This dysfunction is called also base-rate neglect. (Newsome, 2013)
Battle field
	•	The battlefield has been important because traditionally victory has been the objective of most military campaigns. (Coker, 2009)
Battle space
Modern battle space
	•	The modern battle space is a fiendishly complex environment. (Coker, 2009)
Barbaric
	•	L'âme de la race représente l'état de civilisation et l'âme de la foule l'état de barbarie. (Lebon, 1895)
Behavior
Acceptable behaviour
	•	Keep in mind that people from different cultures will consider different forms of behavior acceptable. These are known as display rules. In some cultures people are conditioned to smile less or touch more. Or their language involves greater emphasis on vocal pitch. Always consider the cultural background of people, and interpret their cues accordingly. (Greene, 2018)
Accidental behaviour
	•	People might talk of quitting some addiction, or not working so damned hard, or staying away from a self- destructive relationship. They then fall into the behavior they spoke of trying to avoid, blaming it on an uncontrollable illness or dependency. This salves their conscience for indulging their dark side; they simply can’t help it. Ignore the justifications and see the Shadow operating and releasing. Also remember that when people are drunk and behave differently, often it is not the alcohol that is speaking but the Shadow. (Greene, 2018)
Behavior modification
	•	How to change individual and organizational behaviour is another issue that figures large in the politics and public debate surrounding risk regulation. (Hood et al., 2001)
	•	behaviour modification can often be a highly problematic component of risk regulation. Not only can the preferences and incentive structures of bureaucrats produce distortions (Clay and Schaffer 1984: 10; Dunleavy 1991), but the attitudes and beliefs of those regulated can unexpectedly shape the outcome produced by implementation instruments. (Hood et al., 2001)
	•	The plasticity and unpredictability of cultural shifts often makes such effects hard to gauge in advance. (Hood et al., 2001)
	•	The overall bias of a regulatory regime towards emphasis on compliance or deterrence can be expected to be a key feature of its behaviour-modification style. (Hood et al., 2001)
Behavior protocols
	•	Behavior protocols such as eye movement protocols, performance tests, and doze tests can provide information such as what text or graphics readers are actually processing, how fast they can find information in a brochure, and how easily they can interpret a narrative. (Bostrom et al., 1994)
Compulsive behaviour
	•	We see these patterns and they don’t, because nobody likes to believe that they are operating under some kind of compulsion beyond their control. It is too disturbing a thought. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Confidence without Self-awareness and control can become grandiosity. Without conscious effort, these strengths will tend to wear down or turn into weaknesses. What this means is that the weakest parts of our character are the ones that create habits and compulsive behavior, because they do not require effort or practice to maintain. (Greene, 2018)
Contradictory behavior
	•	It consists of actions that belie the carefully constructed front that people present. For instance, a person who preaches morals is suddenly caught out in a very compromising situation. Or someone with a tough exterior reveals insecurities and hysteria at the wrong moment. Or a person who preaches free love and open behavior suddenly becomes quite domineering and authoritarian. (Greene, 2018)
	•	The strange, contradictory behavior is a direct expression of the Shadow. (Greene, 2018)
Individual behaviour
Contextual theory of individual behaviour
	•	Contextual theories of individual behaviour argue that (i) individual preferences and actions are influenced through social interaction and (ii) social interaction is structured by the social composition of the relevant environment [47]. The dynamic of “meeting” and “mating” by which strangers are converted to acquaintances, acquaintances to friends, and even maybe friends into partner follow the same rules. Meeting depends on opportunities alone (i.e., to be in the same place at the same time); instead, mating depends on both opportunities and attraction. How readily an acquaintance is converted to close friend depends on how attractive two people find each other and how easily they can get together. (Hassan et al., 2011)
Human behavior
Patter of human behaviour
	•	Throughout recorded history we can detect patterns of human behavior that transcend culture and time, indicating certain universal features that belong to us as a species. (Greene, 2014)
	•	Some of these traits are quite positive—for instance, our ability to cooperate with one another in a group—while some of them are negative and can prove destructive. (Greene, 2014)
	•	you must come to understand your own character, examining as best you can the elements in your past that have gone into forming it, and the patterns, mostly negative, that you can see recurring in your life. It is impossible to get rid of this stamp that constitutes your character. It is too deep. But through awareness, you can learn to mitigate or stop certain negative patterns. You can work to transform the negative and weak aspects of your character into actual strengths. You can try to create new habits and patterns that go with them through practice, actively shaping your character and the destiny that goes with it. (Greene, 2018)
	•	you must develop your skill in reading the character of the people you deal with. To do so, you must consider character as a primary value when it comes to choosing a person to work for or with or an intimate partner. This means giving it more value than their charm, intelligence, or reputation. The ability to observe people’s character—as seen in their actions and patterns—is an absolutely critical social skill. It can help you avoid precisely those kinds of decisions that can spell years of misery—choosing an incompetent leader, a shady partner, a scheming assistant, or the kind of incompatible spouse who can poison your life. But it is a skill you must consciously develop, because we humans are generally inept when it comes to such assessments. (Greene, 2018)
Pacifying behavior
	•	As opposed to feeling entitled to touch others, they will tend to touch themselves in what is known as pacifying behavior. They will touch their hair, their neck, their forehead, all in an attempt to soothe their nerves. People trying to hide their insecurities will assert themselves a little too loudly in a conversation, their voices rising. (Greene, 2018)
Belief
	•	These beliefs are usually expressed in statements such as "I think that ...," "chances are ...," "it is unlikely that ...," and so forth. (Tversky and Kahneman, 1974)
	•	Occasionally, beliefs concerning uncertain events are expressed in numerical form as odds or subjective probabilities. (Tversky and Kahneman, 1974)
	•	Values and beliefs are said to be 'generated' by social relationships; the former are causally produced by the latter. (Boholm, 1996)
	•	Our natural tendency is to project onto other people our own beliefs and value systems, in ways in which we are not even aware. When it comes to studying another culture, it is only through the use of our empathic powers and by participating in their lives that we can begin to overcome these natural projections and arrive at the reality of their experience. To do so we must overcome our great fear of the Other and the unfamiliarity of their ways. We must enter their belief and value systems, their guiding myths, their way of seeing the world. Slowly, the distorted lens through which we first viewed them starts to clear up. Going deeper into their Otherness, feeling what they feel, we can discover what makes them different and grasp their reality. This ability to understand from the inside-out is an essential part of mastery.  (Greene, 2014)

Et c'est pourquoi, en étudiant les croyances et les opinions d'un peuple, on constate toujours un fonds très fixe sur lequel se greffent des opinions aussi mobiles que le sable qui recouvre le rocher. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Les croyances et les opinions des foules forment donc deux classes bien distinctes. D'une part, les grandes croyances permanentes, qui durent plusieurs siècles, et sur lesquelles une civilisation entière repose, telles, par exemple, autrefois, la conception féodale, les idées chrétiennes, celles de la Réforme; tels de nos jours, le principe des nationalités, les idées démocratiques et sociales. D'autre part, les opinions momentanées et changeantes, dérivées le plus souvent des conceptions générales, que chaque âge voit naître et mourir: telles sont les théories qui guident les arts et la littérature à certains moments, celles, par exemple, qui ont produit le romantisme, le naturalisme, le mysticisme, etc. Elles sont aussi superficielles, le plus souvent, que la mode, et changent comme elle. Ce sont les petites vagues qui naissent et s'évanouissent sans cesse à la surface d'un lac aux eaux profondes. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Les grandes croyances générales sont en nombre fort restreint. Leur naissance et leur mort forment pour chaque race historique les points culminants de son histoire. Elles constituent la vraie charpente des civilisations. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Il est très facile d'établir une opinion passagère dans l'âme des foules, mais il est très difficile d'y établir une croyance durable. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Les révolutions n'ont même ce pouvoir que lorsque la croyance a perdu presque entièrement son empire sur les âmes. Les révolutions servent alors à balayer finalement ce qui était à peu près abandonné déjà, mais ce que le joug de la coutume empêchait d'abandonner entièrement. Les révolutions qui commencent sont en réalité des croyances qui finissent. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Le jour précis où une grande croyance est marquée pour mourir est facile à reconnaître; c'est celui où sa valeur commence à être discutée. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Toute croyance générale n'étant guère qu'une fiction ne saurait subsister qu'à la condition de n'être pas soumise à l'examen. Mais alors même qu'une croyance est fortement ébranlée, les institutions qui en dérivent conservent leur puissance et ne s'effacent que lentement. Lorsqu'elle a enfin perdu complètement son pouvoir, tout ce qu'elle soutenait s'écroule bientôt. (Lebon, 1895)

	•	Ce qui mène surtout les hommes, ce sont les croyances et les coutumes dérivées de ces croyances. Elles règlent les moindres actes de notre existence, et l'esprit le plus indépendant ne songe pas à s'y soustraire. (Lebon, 1895)

Belief system
	•	détermination culturelle des valeurs : c’est l’appartenance au groupe qui fixe les croyances et leurs limites. (Mannoni, 1985)
Large-scale belief system
	•	This ability to observe the group and detach ourselves is more critical now than ever for several reasons. In the past, people’s sense of belonging to certain groups was more stable and secure. To be a Baptist or a Catholic or a communist or a French citizen provided one with a strong sense of identity and pride. With the diminishing power of these large-scale belief systems, we have lost this inner security, and yet we retain the same profound human need to belong. So many of us are searching for groups to join, hungry for the approval of others who share our values. We are more permeable than ever. This makes us eager to become a member of the latest cult or political movement. It makes us highly susceptible to the influence of some unscrupulous populist leader who preys upon this need. (Greene, 2018)
Low-scale belief system
	•	This makes us eager to become a member of the latest cult or political movement. It makes us highly susceptible to the influence of some unscrupulous populist leader who preys upon this need. Instead of forming large-scale groups, we now form tribes of diminishing size, to get a greater narcissistic boost. We view larger groups with suspicion.  (Greene, 2018)
Fundamental belief
	•	De la croyance fondamentale, des idées momentanées accessoires peuvent surgir, mais elles portent toujours l'empreinte de la croyance dont elles sont issues. (Lebon, 1895)
General belief
	•	Il les transforme jusqu'à ce qu'il ait trouvé une nouvelle croyance générale qui soit acceptée; et jusque-là il vit forcément dans l'anarchie. (Lebon, 1895)

	•	Ce n'est donc pas sans cause que les peuples ont toujours défendu leurs convictions avec intolérance. Cette intolérance, si critiquable au point de vue philosophique, représente dans la vie des peuples la plus nécessaire des vertus. C'est pour fonder ou maintenir des croyances générales que le moyen âge a élevé tant de bûchers, que tant d'inventeurs et de novateurs sont morts dans le désespoir quand ils évitaient les supplices. C'est pour les défendre que le monde a été tant de fois bouleversé, que tant de millions d'hommes sont morts sur les champs de bataille, et y mourront encore. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Il y a de grandes difficultés à établir une croyance générale, mais, quand elle est définitivement établie, sa puissance est pour longtemps invincible; et quelle que soit sa fausseté philosophique, elle s'impose aux plus lumineux esprits. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Rien ne démontre mieux l'hypnotisation produite par les croyances générales, mais rien ne marque mieux aussi les humiliantes limites de notre esprit. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Dès qu'un dogme nouveau est implanté dans l'âme des foules, il devient l'inspirateur de ses institutions, de ses arts et de sa conduite. L'empire qu'il exerce alors sur les âmes est absolu. Les hommes d'action ne songent qu'à le réaliser, les législateurs ne font que l'appliquer, les philosophes, les artistes, les littérateurs ne sont préoccupés que de le traduire sous des formes diverses. (Lebon, 1895)

	•	L'absurdité philosophique que présentent souvent les croyances générales n'a jamais été un obstacle à leur triomphe. Ce triomphe ne semble même possible qu'à la condition qu'elles renferment quelque mystérieuse absurdité. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Ce n'est donc pas l'évidente faiblesse des croyances socialistes actuelles qui les empêchera de triompher dans l'âme des foules. Leur véritable infériorité par rapport à toutes les croyances religieuses tient uniquement à ceci: l'idéal de bonheur que promettaient ces dernières ne devant être réalisé que dans une vie future, personne ne pouvait contester cette réalisation. L'idéal de bonheur socialiste devant être réalisé sur terre, dès les premières tentatives de réalisation, la vanité des promesses apparaîtra aussitôt, et la croyance nouvelle perdra du même coup tout prestige. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Tous ceux contraires aux croyances générales et aux sentiments de la race n'ont qu'une durée éphémère, et le fleuve détourné reprend bientôt son cours.

Formées par suggestion et contagion, elles sont toujours momentanées; elles naissent et disparaissent parfois aussi rapidement que les dunes de sable formées par le vent au bord de la mer. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	L'effacement des croyances générales laisse place à une foule d'opinions particulières sans passé ni avenir. La seconde raison est que la puissance des foules devenant de plus en plus grande et ayant de moins en moins de contrepoids, la mobilité extrême d'idées que nous avons constatée chez elles, peut se manifester librement.

	•	L'opinion des foules tend donc à devenir de plus en plus le régulateur suprême de la politique. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Cette absence totale de direction de l'opinion, et en même temps la dissolution des croyances générales, ont eu pour résultat final un émiettement complet de toutes les convictions, et l'indifférence croissante des foules pour ce qui ne touche pas nettement leurs intérêts immédiats.

Best alternative to a negotiated agreement
	•	Fisher and Ury (1981) have developed the tenn "BATNA" to explain the motivation behind a group having incentive to negotiate. (Baughman, 1995)
	•	Susskind and Cruikshank (1987) note that no group should choose to participate in a negotiation if what it can obtain apart from the bargaining process (its BATNA) is better than what negotiation is likely to provide. (Baughman, 1995)
	•	Prior to the initiation of negotiations, the mediator can assist parties in estimating their BATNA. Once negotiations begin, the ability of all parties to know that participants are participating in good faith can, in part, be based upon the knowledge that each group understands its BATNA. (Baughman, 1995)
	•	Once matters of BATNA and representation have been resolved, the mediator should seek to develop and have the parties agree to protocols to govern the mediation process. Participants are free to structure the process in any manner consistent with their needs to achieve a consensual agreement. (Baughman, 1995)
Best Available Technology principles
	•	The BAT principle is a well established risk management principle that is closely related to the principle of inherent safety and substitution principles. (Swedish Chemicals Agency et al., 2007)
Biases
	•	Biases can affect risk management policies in many ways. Irrational fears among the public caused by these biases, for example, can affect local and national policy-makers if they perceive that a particular regulation may be popular among the voting public. (Löfstedt, 2005)
	•	BAT is included in the EU rules for permitting and controlling industrial installations (Directive 96/61/EC) concerning integrated pollution prevention and control (the IPPC Directive). (Swedish Chemicals Agency et al., 2007)
	•	the BAT principle requires the use of “the most effective and advanced stage in the development of activities and their methods of operation”, taking into account e.g. the use of less hazardous substances, the furthering of recovery and recycling of substances, technological advances and changes in scientific knowledge and understanding, the need to prevent or minimize the overall impact of the emissions, and the need to prevent accidents (European directive 96/61EC September 24th, 1996). (Swedish Chemicals Agency et al., 2007)
	•	While they may be described in many ways, for simplicity’s sake, the taxonomy of errors might include at least four major forms of bias: cognitive, organizational, cultural, and political. At times, these categories blend together and often, but not always, they reinforce each other. (George, 2010)
	•	When psychological experiments reveal the existence of a bias, this does not mean that every judgment by every individual person will be biased. It means that in any group of people, the bias will exist to a greater or lesser degree in most judgments made by most of the group. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	On the basis of this kind of experimental evidence, one can only generalize about the tendencies of groups of people, not make statements about how any specific individual will think. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Bias is the inclination to present or hold a partial perspective at the expense of possibly equally valid alternatives. A related, prevalent phenomenon, groupthink, refers to the mode of thinking that happens when the desire for harmony in a decision-making group overrides a realistic appraisal of options. (Serrat, 2017)
	•	Bias can be minimized, however, by enforcing rigorous standards of evidence and comparison, and the effects of bias can be mitigated or made productive by organizing the confrontation of views in as systematic a manner as possible. (Betts, 2007)
	•	Analysts’ and policy makers’ biases and preconceptions shape how information is received and analyzed. (Byman, 2005)
Appearance bias
	•	I understand the people I deal with; I see them just as they are. (Greene, 2018)
	•	We see people not as they are, but as they appear to us. And these appearances are usually misleading. (Greene, 2018)
	•	people have trained themselves in social situations to present the front that is appropriate and that will be judged positively. They seem to be in favor of the noblest causes, always presenting themselves as hardworking and conscientious. We take these masks for reality. (Greene, 2018)
	•	we are prone to fall for the halo effect—when we see certain negative or positive qualities in a person (social awkwardness, intelligence), other positive or negative qualities are implied that fit with this. People who are good-looking generally seem more trustworthy, particularly politicians. If a person is successful, we imagine they are probably also ethical, conscientious, and deserving of their good fortune. This obscures the fact that many people who have gotten ahead have done so through. (Greene, 2018)
Attribution bias
	•	When we make a mistake, we attribute it to circumstances that pushed us into doing it. But when others make a mistake, we tend to see it as a character flaw, as something that flowed from their imperfect personality. This is known as the attribution bias. You must work against this. With an empathic attitude, you consider first the circumstances that might have made a person do what they did, giving them the same benefit of the doubt as you give yourself. (Greene, 2018)

Confirmation bias
	•	The most common cognitive bias identified in anthropologist Rob Johnston’s study of intelligence professionals was confirmation bias, “the tendency of individuals to select evidence that supports rather than refutes a given hypothesis.”(Betts, 2007)
	•	There is confirmation bias, the natural tendency to pay more attention to news that appears to confirm your views. (Omand, 2014)
	•	“Satisficing” and “confirmation bias,” two common causes of analytic failure, stand in the way of a rigorous examination of the evidence. (Pherson, 2009)
	•	“Confirmation bias” refers to viewing the evidence only from the perspective of whether or not it supports our preconceived answer.(Pherson, 2009)
	•	The leading techniques for overcoming “satisficing” and “confirmation bias” are Multiple Hypotheses Generation, Analysis of Competing Hypotheses (ACH), and a recent web-based variant called Collaborative-Analysis of Competing Hypotheses (C-ACH). (Pherson, 2009)
	•	The confirmation bias or heuristic is an example of a bias created by the attitude of the listener. In the case of an advisory report, for instance, a reader may choose which chapters, sections, and sentences to read, and the amount of attention to be paid to each. It has been demonstrated that readers with a positive attitude toward a report’s conclusion read it in more depth than those with a negative attitude. (Weiss, 2008)
	•	a tendency to search for or interpret information in ways that confirm preconceptions, preferences, and assumptions, while downplaying or discrediting alternative or less-agreeable explanations that tend not to confirm the preferred explanation or interpretation of events (Artner et al., 2016)
	•	I look at the evidence and arrive at my decisions through more or less rational processes. (Greene, 2018)
	•	because of the pleasure principle and its unconscious influence, we manage to find the evidence that confirms what we want to believe. This is known as confirmation bias. (Greene, 2018)
	•	A plan is designed to lead to a positive, desired objective. If people considered the possible negative and positive consequences equally, they might find it hard to take any action. Inevitably they veer toward information that confirms the desired positive result, the rosy scenario, without realizing it.  (Greene, 2018)
	•	The more powerful the person, the more they are subject to this form of the confirmation bias. (Greene, 2018)
Conviction bias
	•	I believe in this idea so strongly. It must be true. (Greene, 2018)
	•	This bias is revealed even more clearly in our relationship to leaders—if they express an opinion with heated words and gestures, colorful metaphors and entertaining anecdotes, and a deep well of conviction, it must mean they have examined the idea carefully to express it with such certainty. (Greene, 2018)
	•	This bias makes us susceptible to salesmen and demagogues who display conviction as a way to convince and deceive. They know that people are hungry for entertainment, so they cloak their half-truths with dramatic effects. (Greene, 2018)
Satisficing
	•	“Satisficing” and “confirmation bias,” two common causes of analytic failure, stand in the way of a rigorous examination of the evidence. (Pherson, 2009)
	•	“Satisficing” is the technical term for the tendency to accept the first answer that comes to mind that is “good enough.” (Pherson, 2009)
	•	The leading techniques for overcoming “satisficing” and “confirmation bias” are Multiple Hypotheses Generation, Analysis of Competing Hypotheses (ACH), and a recent web-based variant called Collaborative-Analysis of Competing Hypotheses (C-ACH). (Pherson, 2009)
	•	As classically expounded by Simon (1955, 1956), satisficing  is  a  theory  of  choice  focused  on  the process  by  which  alternatives  are  examined  and assessed.  As  such,  it  contrasts  with  optimization theory.  Simon  has  explained  that  the  contrast  is between  ‘looking  for  the  sharpest  needle  in  the haystack’  (optimizing)  and  ‘looking  for  a  needle sharp  enough  to  sew  with’  (satisficing)  (Simon,1987:  244). (Winter, 2000)
	•	the  costs  of  the  satisficing  process  are radically lower  than  those of  optimizing. (Winter, 2000)
	•	the satisficing framework  depend  crucially  on  the  ability  to  characterize  the  likely  behavior  of  performance  aspiration. (Winter, 2000)
	•	satisficing leads to impaired performance. (Oppenheimer et al., 2009)
Cognitive bias / mindsets
	•	cognitive bias is inherent to the ‘‘cognition’’ process every analyst uses to examine an intelligence topic. (George, 2010)
	•	As analysts become more expert in their field—be it ballistic missile developments, Iranian domestic politics, or global energy resources—they develop a pattern of thinking (sometimes called a ‘‘mindset’’) which is a working model of how missile programs develop, Iranian political leaders behave, or energy resources are discovered, exploited, and marketed. (George, 2010)
	•	This expertise and demonstrated skill at understanding one’s field naturally increases the analyst’s confidence in his or her judgments. Others rely on the word of such experts, and the analyst develops a reputation for being one of the office’s best and brightest. (George, 2010)
	•	Over time, however, this expertise can develop a kind of paradox: that is, the more expert one becomes—relying upon a highly developed mental model of the intelligence target—the more the analyst becomes prone to missing major discontinuities or key changes in a foreign government’s politics or in an economic or technical phenomenon. (George, 2010)
	•	the symptoms of cognitive bias were there: adhering to a ‘‘conventional wisdom’’ of how the subject behaved, resisting any evidence that was contrary or inconsistent with the current explanation of the problem, and presuming that the future would look pretty much like the past. (George, 2010)
	•	Although he was aware of what is now called cognitive bias, his writings urge analysts to “make the call” without much discussion of how limitations of the human mind were to be overcome. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Cognitive biases are mental errors caused by our simplified information processing strategies. It is important to distinguish cognitive biases from other forms of bias, such as cultural bias, organizational bias, or bias that results from one’s own self-interest. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	a cognitive bias does not result from any emotional or intellectual predisposition toward a certain judgment, but rather from subconscious mental procedures for processing information. A cognitive bias is a mental error that is consis- tent and predictable. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Cognitive biases are similar to optical illusions in that the error remains compelling even when one is fully aware of its nature. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Awareness of the bias, by itself, does not produce a more accurate perception. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Cognitive biases, therefore, are, exceedingly difficult to overcome. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	affect the evaluation of evidence, perception of cause and effect, estimation of probabilities, and retrospective evaluation of intelligence reports. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Like optical illusions, cognitive biases remain compelling even after we become aware of them. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Mindsets, as bad as they may sound, are neither good nor bad, they are simply unavoidable. (Pherson, 2009)
	•	analytic mindsets are easy to form and extraordinarily difficult to overcome. If the analyst is lucky and has happened on the correct mental mindset─or, better yet, has tested his or her mindset and found it sound, the analysis will be accurate. (Pherson, 2009)
	•	It is far more often the case that first impressions, partial information, and sometimes faulty assumptions underpin analytic mindsets. This weak foundation then gradually gains credence as analysts encounter more data that reinforces their mindset. In some cases, analysts will actively mold new data to make it consistent with their emerging conceptual framework─often a key reason that the warning klaxon is not sounded. When new data is consistently interpreted as “business as usual” and key assumptions are not challenged, the result, at best, is poor analysis; at worst, it becomes the explanation for why we have stumbled into another major intelligence failure. (Pherson, 2009)
	•	‘‘Mind-sets’’ can pose a fatal trap in that process: history is full of examples in which commanders have erred because they held to an inaccurate picture of the other’s value, or their goals, intentions, or capabilities. (George, 2004)
	•	A simple definition of a mind-set might be a series of expectations through which a human being sees the world. Over time, the strategist and intelligence analyst develop these expectations, based on how past events have occurred; each will draw general conclusions about therelationships among important international phenomena, about how states typically behave (e.g., maximizing power vis-à-vis others), or about foreign leaders’ motivations. As new events occur, data consistent with earlier patterns of beliefs are more likely to be accepted as valid, while data that conflicts with an analyst’s expectations is discounted or set aside. (George, 2004)
	•	It is human nature, according to many psychological studies, for individuals to ‘‘perceive what they expect to perceive,’’ and holding such mind-sets is virtually unavoidable. The more expert one becomes, the more firm become one’s set of expectations about the world. (George, 2004)
	•	While these mind-sets can be very helpful in sorting through incoming data, they become an Achilles heel to a professional strategist or intelligence analyst when they become out of date because of new international dynamics. Knowing when a mind-set is becoming obsolete and in need of revision can test the mettle of the best expert. (George, 2004)
	•	the application of rigorous analytic techniques can help significantly in averting the likelihood of surprise by uncovering analytical mind-sets and sensitizing policymakers to the inherent uncertainty surrounding major international developments that they confront each day. (George, 2004)
	•	From the very beginning, the problem of ‘‘mind-sets’’ was recognized as a key impediment to effective intelligence analysis. (George, 2004)
	•	Sherman Kent, a Yale historian, wartime member of the OSS, and faculty member at the National War College in 1947, was one of the earliest intelligence officers to identify—among many things—the problem of ‘‘mind-sets’’ as a barrier to proper interpretation of international developments. (George, 2004)
	•	Despite all the technological advances made in U.S. intelligence capabilities, the battle against mind-sets, or what Kent described as ‘‘intellectual frailties,’’ remains unfinished business. (George, 2004)
	•	Analysts naturally favor information that fits their well-formed mental models, and often dismiss other information that might support an alternative hypothesis. Or, they minimize the importance of intelligence gaps and foreign deception and denial efforts, believing U.S. intelligence systems are spoof-proof or American analysts too clever to be outwitted by third-class intelligence services. Even more invidious, the more expert one becomes, the more likely one is to discount the possibility of surprise. (George, 2004)
	•	‘‘The disadvantage of a mind-set,’’ notes Heuer, ‘‘is that it can color and control our perception to the extent that an experienced specialist may be among the last to see what is really happening when events take a new and unexpected turn.’’ (George, 2004)
	•	Cognitive and perceptual biases in human perception and judgment are another important reason for analysts to consider alternatives. (US Government, 2009)
	•	As Richards Heuer and others have argued, all individuals assimilate and evaluate information through the medium of “mental models” (sometimes also called “frames” or “mind-sets”). These are experience-based constructs of assumptions and expectations both about the world in general and more specific domains. (US Government, 2009)
	•	These constructs strongly influence what information analysts will accept—that is, data that are in accordance with analysts’ unconscious mental models are more likely to be perceived and remembered than information that is at odds with them. (US Government, 2009)
	•	Mental models are critical to allowing individuals to process what otherwise would be an incomprehensible volume of information. Yet, they can cause analysts to overlook, reject, or forget important incoming or missing information that is not in accord with their assumptions and expectations. Seasoned analysts may be more susceptible to these mind-set problems as a result of their expertise and past success in using time-tested mental models. (US Government, 2009)
	•	The key risks of mind-sets are that: analysts perceive what they expect to perceive; once formed, they are resistant to change; new information is assimilated, sometimes erroneously, into existing mental models; and conflicting information is often dismissed or ignored. (US Government, 2009)
	•	Intelligence analysts must actively review the accuracy of their mind-sets by applying structured analytic techniques that will make those mental models more explicit and expose their key assumptions. (US Government, 2009)
	•	The techniques found in this primer are designed to assist in this regard by: Instilling more structure into the intelligence analysis. Making analytic arguments more transparent by articulating them and challenging key assumptions. Stimulating more creative, “out-of-the- box” thinking and examining alternative outcomes, even those with low probability, to see if available data might support these outcomes. Identifying indicators of change (or signposts) that can reduce the chances of surprise. (US Government, 2009)
	•	Information that is consistent with an existing mind-set is perceived and processed easily and reinforces existing beliefs. Because the mind strives instinctively for consistency, information that is inconsistent with an existing mental image tends to be overlooked, perceived in a distorted manner, or rationalized to fit existing assumptions and beliefs. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Beliefs, assumptions, concepts, and information retrieved from memory form a mind-set or mental model that guides perception and processing of new information. The nature of the intelligence business forces us to deal with issues at an early stage when hard information is incomplete. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	A mind-set is neither good nor bad. It is unavoidable. It is, in es- sence, a distillation of all that analysts think they know about a subject. It forms a lens through which they perceive the world, and once formed, it resists change. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	To avoid this mind- set problem, each research report was reviewed by a committee of three analysts from other branches handling other countries or issues. None of them had specialized knowledge of the subject. They were, however, highly accomplished analysts. Precisely because they had not been im- mersed in the issue in question, they were better able to identify hidden assumptions and other alternatives, and to judge whether the analysis adequately supported the conclusions. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	As a general rule, people are too slow to change an established view, as opposed to being too willing to change. The human mind is conservative. It resists change. Assumptions that worked well in the past continue to be applied to new situations long after they have become outmoded. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Analysts should keep a record of unexpected events and think hard about what they might mean, not disregard them or explain them away. It is important to consider whether these surprises, however small, are consistent with some alternative hypothesis. One unexpected event may be easy to disregard, but a pattern of surprises may be the first clue that your understanding of what is happening requires some adjustment, is at best incomplete, and may be quite wrong. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Guard against the various cognitive biases. Especially dangerous are those biases that occur when you lack sufficient understanding of how a situation appears from another country’s point of view. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Management should also support research on the mind-sets and im- plicit mental models of intelligence analysts. Because these mind-sets or models serve as a “screen” or “lens” through which analysts perceive for- eign developments, research to determine the nature of this “lens” may contribute as much to accurate judgments as does research focused more directly on the foreign areas themselves. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Cognitive barriers play a role too: individuals and groups may be biased; when they have worked hard on a plan they can also become psychologically committed to the idea of success, be overconfident, and therefore blind to some of its risks. (Serrat, 2017)
	•	Among cognitive biases some that have been recognized are:• The Von Restorff effect—the tendency for an item that ‘stands out like a sore thumb’ to be more likely to be remembered than other items.• Contrast effect—the enhancement or diminishment of the weight of a piece of evidence when compared with recently observed contrast- ing information.• Focusing effect—prediction bias occurring when people place too much importance on one aspect of an event.• Anchoring—the tendency to rely too heavily, or ‘anchor,’ on one trait or piece of information when making decisions.• The halo effect—if one aspect is bad (or good), a tendency to interpret all aspects as bad (or good).• The observer-expectancy effect—when an analyst expects a given result and therefore unconsciously misinterprets data in order to find it. (Omand, 2014)

Cultural bias
	•	Often accompanying well-known forms of cognitive bias, analysts must often contend with a more culturally based form of analytic error. (George, 2010)
	•	prone to view an adversary by referencing their own cultural norms, ways of behaving, and sense of what is ‘‘rational’’ behavior, a tendency often referred to as ‘‘mirror imaging.’’ (George, 2010)
	•	Typically, analysts must reach a judgment on a foreign government’s actions or decision on the basis of what they assume would be the most ‘‘logical’’ or ‘‘rational’’ choice. (George, 2010)
	•	What an intelligence analyst might view as the most logical way to calculate the risks and benefits of different actions is, perhaps more often than not, not the way leaders in Arab, Asian, or African cultures will calculate. The importance of tribal, religious, and ethnic customs—particularly as regards a ruler’s ‘‘status, his sense of ‘‘honor,’’ or the need for ‘‘face-saving’’—can often complicate the analyst’s challenge in forecasting how a decision will be reached. (George, 2010)

(George, 2010)
	•	the cultural bias will never be satisfactorily addressed until the IC seriously reviews its analytic outreach and hiring practices. (George, 2010)
Group bias
	•	The feeling of isolation, of difference from the group, is depressing and terrifying. We experience tremendous relief when we find others who think the same way we do. In fact, we are motivated to take up ideas and opinions because they bring us this relief. (Greene, 2018)
	•	When we are in a group of a large enough size, we become different. Notice yourself and others at a sporting event, a concert, a religious or political gathering. It is impossible to not feel yourself caught up in the collective emotions. Your heart beats faster. Tears of joy or sadness come more readily. Being in a group does not stimulate independent reasoning but rather the intense desire to belong. (Greene, 2018)
	•	This can happen equally in a work environment, particularly if the leader plays on people’s emotions to spur competitive, aggressive desires, or creates an us-versus-them dynamic. The group effect does not necessarily require the presence of others. It can occur virally, as some opinion spreads over social media and infects us with the desire to share the opinion—generally of a strong variety, such as outrage. (Greene, 2018)
	•	There is an exhilarating, positive aspect to the stimulation of group emotions. It is how we can be rallied to do something for the collective good. (Greene, 2018)
	•	It is often best to avoid the group setting if possible in order to maintain your reasoning powers, or to enter such moments with maximum skepticism. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Be aware of demagogues who exploit the group effect and stimulate outbreaks of irrationality. They inevitably resort to certain devices. In a group setting, they begin by warming up the crowd, talking about ideas and values that everyone shares, creating a pleasant feeling of agreement. They rely on vague but loaded words full of emotive quality such as justice or truth or patriotism. They talk of abstract, noble goals rather than the solving of specific problems with concrete action. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Demagogues in politics or the media try to stir a continual sense of panic, urgency, and outrage. They must keep the emotional levels high. Your defense is simple: Consider your reasoning powers, your ability to think for yourself, your most precious possession. Resent any kind of intrusion upon your independent mind by others. When you feel you are in the presence of demagogue, become doubly wary and analytical. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Examine your strengths, what makes you different from other people. This will help you decide upon goals that mesh with your long-term interests and that are aligned with your skills. By knowing and valuing what marks you as different, you will also be able to resist the pull of the group bias and effect. (Greene, 2018)
	•	you must develop your skill in reading the character of the people you deal with. To do so, you must consider character as a primary value when it comes to choosing a person to work for or with or an intimate partner. This means giving it more value than their charm, intelligence, or reputation. The ability to observe people’s character—as seen in their actions and patterns—is an absolutely critical social skill. It can help you avoid precisely those kinds of decisions that can spell years of misery—choosing an incompetent leader, a shady partner, a scheming assistant, or the kind of incompatible spouse who can poison your life. But it is a skill you must consciously develop, because we humans are generally inept when it comes to such assessments. (Greene, 2018)

Organizational bias
	•	That is, the analyst is likely to believe that his organization’s view should prevail, in part to reflect the primacy of that office in following the topic in question. (George, 2010)
	•	A CIA tradecraft expert, Jack Davis, has termed this phenomenon ‘‘tribal think’’—to reflect the pressure within an office to preserve the prevailing paradigm, tamp down deviant views that challenge the office’s long held views, and reeducate younger analysts to understand and accept how an office perceives an issue. (George, 2010)
	•	In the Agency, and in other intelligence agencies, only ‘‘one organizational view’’ of an issue can prevail. Such conformity defies both human nature and logic. (George, 2010)
	•	As former Deputy Director of National Intelligence (DDNI) for Analysis Thomas Fingar contrasted it a few years ago: ‘‘Imagine if Harvard or Princeton had a single view on an issue; that just would not happen.’’ So, within the CIA and other analytic shops, the insistence is on a degree of conformity that is not natural and, in many respects, not accurate. Getting away from characterizing a viewpoint as being the ‘‘CIA’s’’ or ‘‘INR’s’’ (the State Department’s Bureau of Intelligence and Research) is probably healthy, as it helps to break down the unnatural tendency to side with one’s own agency merely because the analyst is part of the office where one’s career is made. (George, 2010)
	•	Individual analysts are often not sensitive to these organizational biases until they begin to work with other offices and agencies. As they begin their careers within an office, they can easily and quickly become captive to the office perspective without knowing it. (George, 2010)
	•	The danger of not acknowledging the power of organizational cultures is that offices will hang onto obsolete views of an issue too long, without recognizing that perhaps the issue has changed and the office’s line should change as well. (George, 2010)
	•	This per- ceptual bias is reinforced by organizational pressures favoring consistent interpretation; once the analyst is committed in writing, both the analyst and the organization have a vested interest in maintaining the original assessment. (Heuer, 1999)
Political bias
	•	More than any other form of bias so far mentioned, political bias is a many-headed dragon. Coming in a variety of forms, it depends greatly on the interpretation of motives behind the intelligence analysis, not the judgments per se. (George, 2010)
	•	political bias in analysis does occur. But, it is much less frequent than the other forms of bias that crop up. (George, 2010)
	•	Most political bias that can be proven is the result of analysts being pressured—or at least feeling pressure—from senior managers or outside customers to alter their views to accord with a prevailing opinion within an administration. (George, 2010)
	•	Cases of ‘‘politicization’’ occur most often in the misuse of analysis rather than the misconduct of analysts themselves. (George, 2010)
	•	This form of politicization is the least internally controllable because intelligence agencies are ultimately producers, not users, of intelligence. (George, 2010)
	•	the question arises as to how much responsibility analysts have to ‘‘correct the record’’ when they feel their analysis is being misused or skewed for political purposes. (George, 2010)
	•	Minimal contamination by political bias, or open and balanced competition be- tween analysis from different predispositions, must be the norm, but enforcing it may generate just as many charges of politicization as it averts. Much depends on the artful straddling of thin lines by intelli- gence managers—something not easily done—or on signals sent in the choice of managers. (Betts, 2007)

Pre-existing imppressions
	•	The tendency to interpret new information in the context of pre-existing impressions is relevant but probably not sufficient to explain why the pre-existing impression cannot be eradicated even when new information authoritatively discredits the evidence on which it is based. (Heuer, 1999)
Superiority bias
	•	I’m different. I’m more rational than others, more ethical as well. (Greene, 2018)
	•	for instance, we’ll easily believe that those in the other political party do not come to their opinions based on rational principles, but those on our side have done so. (Greene, 2018)
Systematic biases
	•	Evaluations of intelligence analysis—analysts’ own evaluations of their judgments as well as others’ evaluations of intelligence products—are distorted by systematic biases. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	As a result, analysts overestimate the quality of their analytical performance, and others underestimate the value and quality of their efforts. These biases are not simply the product of self-interest and lack of objectivity. They stem from the nature of human mental processes and are difficult and perhaps impossible to overcome. (Heuer, 1999)
Hindsight biases
	•	Hindsight biases influence the evaluation of intelligence reporting in three ways: Analysts normally overestimate the accuracy of their past judgments; Intelligence consumers normally underestimate how much they learned from intelligence reports.; Overseers of intelligence production who conduct postmortem analyses of an intelligence failure normally judge that events were more readily foreseeable than was in fact the case. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	these biases are not only the product of self-interest and lack of objectivity. They are examples of a broader phenomenon that is built into human mental processes and that cannot be overcome by the simple admonition to be more objective. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	The analyst, consumer, and overseer evaluating analytical performance all have one thing in common. They are exercising hindsight. They take their current state of knowledge and compare it with what they or others did or could or should have known before the current knowledge was received. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	The amount of good information that is available obviously is greater in hindsight than in foresight. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	With the benefit of hindsight, for example, factors previously considered relevant may become irrelevant, and factors previously thought to have little relevance may be seen as determinative. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	pervasive fallac y-the hindsight bias- encourages us to assume that what we know after the fact could have been foreseen. (Hopple, 1984)
	•	with the hindsight bias, the methodological difficulties of trying to explain and forecast rare but catastrophic events makes the job of the warning analyst more than challenging. (Hopple, 1984)
Mental bias
	•	We imagine we are looking for the truth, or being realistic, when in fact we are holding on to ideas that bring a release from tension and soothe our egos, make us feel superior. This pleasure principle in thinking is the source of all of our mental biases. (Greene, 2018)
Biases of judgment and choice 
Overconfidence
	•	As the WY SIATI rule implies, neither the quantity nor the quality of the evidence counts for much in subjective confidence. The confidence that individuals have in their beliefs depends mostly on the quality of the story they can tell about what they see, even if they see little. We often fail to allow for the possibility that evidence that should be critical to our judgment is missing—what we see is all there is. Furthermore, our associative system tends to settle on a coherent pattern of activation and suppresses doubt and ambiguity. (Kahneman, 2012)
Framing effects
	•	Different ways of presenting the same information often evoke different emotions. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	the large changes of preferences that are sometimes caused by inconsequential variations in the wording of a choice problem. (Kahneman, 2012)
Biodegradation
	•	Biodegradation or volatilization are generally considered the predominant pathway in the soil environment, although screening tests for determining the degradation of chemicals in soil have not always distinguished between biological, chemical, or photochemical degradation. (Paustenbach, 2002b)
	•	Biodegradation of an organic chemical refers to the reduction in molecular complexity owing to the metabolic activity of living organisms, usually micro- organisms and particularly bacteria and fungi. When an organic chemical is totally biodegraded in the presence of oxygen (aerobic biodegradation), the end products are inorganic carbon dioxide and water and may also include organic compounds involved in the normal metabolic processes of aerobic micro- organisms. (Paustenbach, 2002b)
	•	Biodegradation is the main process by which organic chemicals, following introduction into the environment, are reduced in complexity. (Paustenbach, 2002b)
Biologic extrapolation
	•	"Biologic extrapolation" involves making inferences from .mouse to man," or scaling the results of laboratory animal experimentsto fit human physiology. (Matheny and Williams, 1984) 
Bisphenol A
	•	Bisphenol A, or BPA, is a human-made chemical used in the manufacture of plastics, that was  first developed in 1891. (Lofstedt, 2011)
	•	Bisphenol A (BPA), a synthetic chemical used in the production of plastics since the 1950s and a known endocrine disruptor, is a ubiquitous component of the material environment and human body. (Vogel, 2009)
	•	Bisphenol A (BPA) is a chemical used extensively to manufacture commonly used plastics and epoxy resin liners for food and beverage cans. (Erler and Novak, 2010)
	•	BPA, with properties similar to diethylstilbestrol, has been shown to exert endocrine-disrupting effects and result in behavioral changes, altered growth, and early secondary sexual maturation. (Erler and Novak, 2010)
	•	BPA is a single hydrocarbon molecule that binds with other molecules to form polymers, such as polystyrene and polycarbonates (Le, Carlson, Chua, & Belcher, 2008). (Erler and Novak, 2010)
	•	Bisphenol A (BPA) is used as a monomer in the synthesis of polycarbonates (PC), a type of polymer utilized in the manufacture of plastic food containers, such as infant feeding bottles. Exhibiting high transparency, low weight and high heat and impact resistance, polycarbonate plastics are increasingly replacing glass in such applications (Plastics Europe 2007). (Maragou et al., 2008)
	•	Bisphenol A (BPA), a man-made chemical used in the manufacture of plastics, was first developed in 1891. (Lofstedt, 2014)

Blame
	•	Blame is associated with competence, compliance with guidance and good practice and is a central issue in a litigious society (Kemshall et al 1997) (Roberts, 2001a)
	•	Reputation and blame have emerged as distinctive kinds of meta-risk objects for all organizations. (Power, 2009)
	•	Regret and blame are both evoked by a comparison to a norm (Kahneman, 2012)

Blame allocation
	•	Blame allocation has an important role in risk management and is a method of exerting political control (Douglas, 1994) (Roberts, 2001a)
Board
	•	The existence of business groups is explicit and legally regulated in most countries; but softer and less regulated forms of influence can exist. The most common of these happens within boards. Managers often sit on many boards at the same time. Obviously, they act as channels of information, alliances, or interests between boards. Their simultaneous presence in different boards establishes an interlock between their companies. If the companies are explicit competitors, this situation is clearly incompatible with a free market. A shared director will either favour one of the companies against the other or establish a cartel between them (which is generally ruled out by law). In general, such a director will find it very difficult to operate in the interest of all the investors in the different companies. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
	•	In company boards, interlocking grants a kind of connectedness that encompasses the vast majority of companies. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
Body
	•	The mind and the body are one, and your thoughts affect your physical responses. People can recover much more quickly from illness through sheer desire and willpower. (Greene, 2018)
Boundary
	•	A new boundary typically identifies a new agent, so boundaries are closely associated with emergent phenomena. (Holland, 2014)
	•	This formation of boundaries that mediate interactions between agents leads directly to the notion of ‘niche’. Niche is a widely used term, as in ‘market niche’ or ‘ecological niche’, but it is difficult to define. (Holland, 2014)
	•	Emergence is tightly tied to the formation of boundaries. These boundaries can arise from symmetry breaking, as in Ising’s bar magnet model or Turing’s model of morphogenesis (Chapter 2), or they can arise by assembly of component building blocks, as in the assembly of semi-permeable membranes from proteins (Chapter 3). For CAS? The agent-defining boundaries determine the interactions between agents. Indeed the agent-defining boundaries act like semi-permeable membranes, admitting some signals and excluding others. Adaptation, and the emergence of new kinds of agents, then arises from changes in the relevant boundaries. (Holland, 2014)
Boundary objects 
	•	boundary objects, that is, as a focal point for practical change with the ability to appeal across boundaries to a multiplicity of interest groups and potential allies. (Power, 2009)
	•	A boundary object is an object which can inhabit 'several communities of practice and satisfy the informational requirements of each of them. (Power, 2009)
	•	Boundary objects are both plastic enough to adapt to local needs and constraints, yet robust enough to maintain a common identity across sites' (Bowker and Star, 1999: 297). (Power, 2009)
Bounded rationality
	•	“bounded rationality” (i.e. the cognitive limits that prevent individuals and institutions from adopting contingency plans or contracts for all possible states of the world), which limits such goal-setting capacity (Hood and Jones, 1996)
Boomerang effect
	•	The boomerang effect need not manifest itself as a direct threat to life; it can also affect secondary media, money, property and legitimation. It does not just strike back directly at the individual source; in a wholesale, egalitarian way it impairs everyone (Beck, 1992)
	•	Boomerang effect which breaks up the pattern of class and national society (Beck, 1992)
Boss
	•	how people handle power and responsibility will tell you a lot about them. (Greene, 2018)
	•	On the way to gaining power, people will tend to play the courtier, to seem deferential, to follow the party line, to do what it takes to make it to the top. Once at the top, there are fewer restraints and they will often reveal something about themselves you had not noticed before. Some people stay true to the values they had before attaining a high position—they remain respectful and empathetic. On the other hand, far more people suddenly feel entitled to treat others differently now that they have the power. (Greene, 2018)
	•	you need to take notice of what people reveal once they are in power. So often we think that power has changed people, when in fact it simply reveals more of who they are. (Greene, 2018)
Micromanaging boss
	•	because of our blind spot, we suffer under the irresolute leader, the micromanaging boss, the conniving partner. This is the source of endless tragedies in history, our pattern as a species. (Greene, 2018)
Bottomry
	•	[…] the concept of bottomry, which formed the basis for maritime contracts on vessels and cargoes. These bottomry contracts contained three elements: (1) the loan on the vessel, cargo, or freight; (2) an interest rate; and (3) a risk premium for the chance of loss and consequent cancellation of the debt. (Covello and Mumpower, 1986)

Brain
	•	Recent discoveries in neuroscience are overturning long-held beliefs that the brain is genetically hardwired. Scientists are demonstrating the degree to which the brain is actually quite plastic—how our thoughts determine our mental landscape. (Greene, 2014)
	•	Our brains were built for continual social interaction; the complexity of this interaction is one of the main factors that drastically increased our intelligence as a species. (Greene, 2018)
	•	You are not born with fixed intelligence and inherent limits. See your brain as a miraculous organ designed for continual learning and improvement, well into old age. The rich neural connections in your brain, your creative powers, are something you develop to the degree that you open yourself up to new experiences and ideas. (Greene, 2018)
	•	The brain is full of networks where various web-like structures provide the integration between specialized areas. In the cerebellum, neurons form modules that are repeated again and again: the interaction between modules is restricted to neighbours, similarly to what happens in a lattice. In other areas of the brain, we find random connections, with a more or less equal probability of connecting local, intermediate, or distant neurons. Finally, the neocortex—the region involved in many of the higher functions of mammals—combines local structures with more random, long-range connections. Some scientists think that these wiring schemes may be responsible for subjective awareness: the emerging conscience may be the result of a sufficiently complex network structure. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
Briefing
	•	Briefings are a step up, but dependence on them saps intellectual acuity. It takes much longer to hear a given presentation than to read it, further reducing the effective use of limited time, and mediocre analysis seems better than it should when dressed up with PowerPoint, a confident voice, and an entertaining manner. (Betts, 2007)
	•	Dependence on briefings is inevitable, however, not just because they are ingrained in official culture but because they require less energy from the consumer, in the same way that watching televi- sion requires less energy than reading. (Betts, 2007)
Bureaucratic organizations
	•	Bureaucratic organizations have a propensity to trust routine procedures for risk management. They tend, therefore, to have most confidence in long- established institutions that have stood the test of time. The implicit assumption is that those whose routines are not appropriately adapted to cope with the hazards they manage will not survive. (Rayner and Cantor, 1987)
	•	Bureaucratic realities have frustrated other attempts to consolidate the intelligence structure. (Betts, 2007)
Business
	•	Dans les affaires, monsieur, dit-il, on n'a point d'amis, vous le savez bien, on n'a que des correspondants. (Dumas, 1998) 
	•	Comme il l'avait dit, dans le commerce, on a des correspondants et pas d'amis. (Dumas, 1998)
Business continuity
	•	il ne faut jamais, quelque catastrophe qui arrive aux individus, que les affaires souffrent. (Dumas, 1998)
Business intelligence
	•	Business intelligence is the application of intelligence, research and analytical tools to meet key business objectives. (Falanx Assynt, 2018)
Business processes
	•	“business processes and organizational culture ultimately determine the effectiveness of (interagency) collaboration.” The report highlighted impediments to collaboration such as “a cultural tradition inconsistent with information sharing; lack of common goals for collaboration across the community; lack of trust in organizations, individuals and systems; lack of perceived mutual benefit to participate in collaboration efforts; and inadequate reward systems to support collaboration.” (Marrin, 2002)
C
Calling
Inner calling 
	•	With those whos stand out by their later mastery, they experience this inclination more deeply and clearly than others. They experience it as an inner calling. It tends to dominate their thoughts and dreams. They find their way, by accident or sheer effort, to a career path in which this inclination can flourish. The instense connection and desire allow them to withstand the pain of the process – the self-doubts, the tedious hours of practice and study, the inevitable setbacks, the endless barbs from the envious. They develop a resiliency and confidence that others lack. (Greene, 2014)
Cancer
	•	Cancer is a term in today's society loaded with emotions and stigmatization (including death), and industry and regulators have been poor communicators regarding this dis ease (Fischhoff, 1999; Fischhoff et al., 2002). (Lofstedt, 2008)
Capability
	•	Capabilities take time to build up and can be monitored objectively and are thus in the nature of secrets to be uncovered.   (Omand, 2014)

Threat’s capability
	•	an easy way to measure a threat’s capabilities is to count their weapons or rank their weapons, from, for instance: no weapons, blunt objects, knives, hand guns, rifles, heavier weapons. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	if we proved certainty of a threat’s capability and intent to harm a particular target and we proved certainty of the target’s exposure and vulnerability to the threat, we should predict harm. (Newsome, 2013)
Organizational capability
	•	Organizational capabilités can be measured objectively by counting threatening assests (such as weapons and personnel) or inputs (such as military speding). (Newsome, 2013)
Relative capability / Net Assessment
	•	Relative capabilities can be measured by comparing the other’s capabilities against our capabilities (in the military, this process often is know as net assessment). 
	•	We could also compare their offensive capabilities against our defensive capabilities. (Newsome, 2013)For instance, if the other is armed with only blunt instruments and we are armed with firearms or are protected behind materials proof against blunt instruments, then we should conclude that the other actor practically lacks capabilities to harm us and is therefore not a threat but a hazard (although we should remember that the hazard could become a threat by acquiring different weapons). (Newsome, 2013)
	•	an assessment is made of the relative capa- bilities of two military forces, not just the absolute capability of the adversary. Without capability we need not normally fear intention (at least for now, although future capability has of course to be the subject of careful assessment). But capabilities are not of themselves indicators of hostile intent. In assessing intentions, the danger of implicit assump- tions about the hostile nature of the adversary is that they quickly lead to a paranoid state in which all developments are read as hostile. (Omand, 2014)
Adversary capability
Adversarial capability assessment
	•	Assessing adversarial capability relies heavily on good intelligence. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	For security decision makers, assessing the capability of an adversaryincludes the following factors: Number of attackers; SkillsKnowledge of the facility’s security; Types of weapons; Other equipmentMethods and tactics (deceit, force, stealth); Means of transporting attackers, weapons, and equipment; Possible collusion with an insider. (Vellani, 2007)
Capabilities-based model
	•	A capabilities-based model - one that focuses more on how an adversary might fight than who the adversary might be and where a war might occur - broadens the strategic perspective. (DOD, 2001)
	•	Moving to a capabilities-based force also requires the United States to focus on emerging opportunities that certain capabilities, including advanced remote sensing, long-range precision strike, transformed maneuver and expeditionary forces and systems, to overcome anti-access and area denial threats, can confer on the U.S. military over time. (DOD, 2001)
Capacity
	•	Capacitiy is the potential to achieve something. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Different capacities include the potentials to, for instance, acquire capabilities or deliver performance. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	When we identify capacity, we should define also what the capacity might be converted into, because capacities might be useful for one thing but not another. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Capacity is “the ability or power to do something”. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Capacity is “a combination of all the strenghs and resources available within a community, society, or organization that can be used to achieve agreed goals. Comment: Capacity may include infrastructure and physical means, institutions, societal coping abilities, as well as human knowledge, skills, and collective attriutes such as social relationships, leardership, and management. Capacity also may be described as capability. Capacity assessment is a term for the process by which the capacity of a group is reviewed against desired goals, and the capacity gaps are identified for further actions.” (Newsome, 2013)
	•	“Capacity reflects the extent to which a country can absorb or manage a risk factor and take advantage of external stabilitzation.” (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Since capacity is the potential for something, it must be converted into something else to be useful, but different forms of capacity are fungible into some things but not others. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Within political units, economic capacity is the focus, because the economy can be a source of revenues and technologies and expertise that could be converted into other things. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	People with capacity can acquire the various controls that dramatically lower the risks, so when a negative returns are controlled to survivable levels. (Newsome, 2013)

Coping capacity
	•	Coping capacity is “the ability of people, organizations, and systems, using available skills and resources, to face and manage adverse conditions, emergencies, or disasters”. (Newsome, 2013)
Executive capacity
	•	Executive capacity is “the ability of the state to deliver key functions”, such as public health, education, and security. (Newsome, 2013)
Fungible capacity
	•	Some capacity remains somewhat fungible even after conversion into more specialized forms. For instance, military organizations are required for defense against major violent threats and are acquired with expensively trained personnel and specialized equipment but often are mobilized to rescue citizens from natural disasters, too. (Newsome, 2013)
Capitalism
	•	If all the technical forces of capitalism can be understood as tools for the making of separations, in the case of urbanism we confront the basis of these technical forces, the treatment of the earth which is suitable for their deployment, the very technique of separation. (Debord, 2012)
Capitalist production 
	•	Capitalist production has unified space, which is no longer bounded by external societies. This unification is at the same time an extensive and intensive process of banalization. (Debord, 2012)
Captivity
	•	le pis aller, s'il restait prisonnier, était d'avoir un compagnon ; or la captivité partagée n'est plus qu'une demi-captivité. (Dumas, 1998)
Casino
	•	Casinos deal with risks every time a punter plays a roulette table, but they know the odds. And while they cannot predict the outcome of a particular whirl of the roulette wheel, they know that in the aggregate they will make a profit (there is no system that has yet been devised to beat the house). (Coker, 2009)
Caste
	•	La caste représente le plus haut degré d'organisation dont la foule soit susceptible. Alors que la secte comprend des individus de professions, d'éducation, de milieux fort différents et rattachés seulement par la communauté des croyances, la caste ne comprend que des individus de même profession et par conséquent d'éducation et de milieux à peu près semblables. Telles sont la caste militaire et la caste sacerdotale, par exemple. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Redoutons la puissance des foules, mais redoutons beaucoup plus encore la puissance de certaines castes. Les premières peuvent se laisser convaincre, les secondes ne fléchissent jamais. (Lebon, 1895)
Career
Career counselling
	•	Vocational and career counselling examines the nature of rewarding and satisfying career paths in the context of individuals’ different patterns of interest and abilities. (Furnham, 2005)
Career world
	•	The career world is like an ecological system: People occupy particular fields within which they must compete for resources and survival. The more people there are crowded into a space, the harder it becomes to thrive there. Working in such a field will tend to wear you out as you struggle to get attention, to play the political games, to win scarce resources for yourself. (Greene, 2014)
Career path
	•	To follow any career path is difficult, and requires the cultivation of much patince and discipline. We have so many elements to master that it can be intimidating. We must learn to handle the technical aspects, the social and political gamesmanship, the public reactions to our work, and the constantly changing picture in our field. When we ad to this already-daunting quantity of study the vast amounts of information now available to us, and that we must keep on to of, it all seems beyond our capability. (Greene, 2014)
False path
	•	A false path in life is generally a career we are attracted to for the wrong reasons—money, fame, attention, and so on. (Greene, 2014)
Catastrophe
	•	catastrophes send us warning signals. (Perrow, 1999)
	•	« comportements dans les catastrophes », mais la plupart des autres auteurs optent pour le terme pourtant plus littéraire et ambigu de « panique ». (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	il semble, que « catastrophe » et « panique » soient liées par un rapport de causalité, l’une déterminant l’autre. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Essayons donc de préciser tout d’abord ce que l’on ented par catastrophe. Un groupe de recherche a pu souligner que les définitions du langage sont loin de donner des précisions suffisantes pour des besoins opérationnels. Aussi estime-t-il necessaire d’énumérer tout un ensemble de caractères, don’t certains paraissent discutables ou mal délimités: soudaineté, apparition brusque ;  — implication d’un nombre suffisant d’individus plus ou moins organisés en collectivité ;  — dommages matériels importants ; changement complet de tous ou presque les caractères de la situation antérieure de la collectivité ;  — désorganisation ;  — réactions émotives intenses ;  — apparition de phénomènes de masses : solidarité, fuite, panique, convergence, etc. ;  — mise en œuvre de services extérieurs ;  — nécessité de mesures spéciales pour ramener la collectivité à son état antérieur ou à un nouvel état d’équilibre. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	les catastrophes ont un caractère traumatique et laissent des séquelles. (Mannoni, 1985)
Cause
	•	Properties of the cause are “. . .inferred on the basis of being correspondent with or similar to properties of the effect.” (Heuer, 1999)
Causation
	•	It is well known that correlation does not imply causation; the study of chaos has made it clear that causation does not imply (linear) correlation either. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
Causality
	•	causality ‘a metaphysical hypostalization of a well justified methodological rule’ (Carr 1972:94), which is merely a philosopher’s way of saying that the idea that everything has a cause is a condition of understanding what is going on around us. (Coker, 2009)
	•	Causality, in a word, is only partial. We can partially model, predict and control events; we can even make decisions according to a probability checklist. But a cause may not lead to an effect, and not every effect will have a discernible cause. Behaviour emerges like life. (Coker, 2009)
	•	The conclusion that one ball caused the other to move results only from a complex process of inference, not from direct sensory perception. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	In more formal analysis, inferences are made through procedures that collectively comprise the scientific method. The scientist advances a hypothesis, then tests this hypothesis by the collection and statistical analysis of data on many instances of the phenomenon in question. Even then, causality cannot be proved beyond all possible doubt. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	The prevalence of the word “because” in everyday language reflects the human tendency to seek to identify causes. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	When systematic analysis of covariation is not feasible and several alternative causal explanations seem possible, one rule of thumb people use to make judgments of cause and effect is to consider the similarity between attributes of the cause and attributes of the effect. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	The tendency to reason according to similarity of cause and effect is frequently found in conjunction with the previously noted bias toward inferring centralized direction. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	In examining causal relationships, analysts generally construct causal explanations that are somehow commensurate with the magnitude of their effects and that attribute events to human purposes or predictable forces rather than to human weakness, confusion, or unintended consequences. (Heuer, 1999)
Biased attribution of causality
	•	Susceptibility to this biased attribution of causality depends upon whether people are examining their own behavior or observing that of others. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	It is the behavior of others that people tend to attribute to the nature of the actor, whereas they see their own behavior as conditioned almost entirely by the situation in which they find themselves. This dif- ference is explained largely by differences in information available to actors and observers. People know a lot more about themselves. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	attribution of causality helps sow the seeds of mistrust and misunderstanding between people and between governments. We tend to have quite different perceptions of the causes of each other’s behavior. (Heuer, 1999)
Causal judgement
	•	Judgments about cause and effect are necessary to explain the past, understand the present, and estimate the future. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	These judgments are often biased by factors over which people exercise little conscious control, and this can influence many types of judgments made by intelligence analysts. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Because of a need to impose order on our environment, we seek and often believe we find causes for what are actually accidental or random phenomena. People overestimate the extent to which other countries are pursuing a coherent, coordinated, rational plan, and thus also overestimate their own ability to predict future events in those nations. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	People also tend to assume that causes are similar to their effects, in the sense that important or large effects must have large causes. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	When inferring the causes of behavior, too much weight is accorded to personal qualities and dispositions of the actor and not enough to situational determinants of the actor’s behavior. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	People also overestimate their own importance as both a cause and a target of the behavior of others. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	people often perceive relationships that do not in fact exist, because they do not have an intuitive understanding of the kinds and amount of information needed to prove a relationship. (Heuer, 1999)
Causal reasoning
	•	Causal reasoning about human activity and affairs involves complexities and subtleties rarely acknowledged in the academic or scientific literatures of psychology, philosophy or sociology. For all the studies and discourses on causal reasoning generated over the centuries, this is still an open area for cognitive research and discoveries about analytical reasoning. (Hoffman et al., 2011)
	•	Theorists may tend to assume that ‘causal reasoning’ is a isolable process. But causal reasoning does not always have clear-cut beginnings and endings: some key event happens and leads to a cause, and in retrospectively understanding this, the decision maker has to apprehend the effect and the cause and feel satisfied that the effect has been plausibly explained. Sometimes the ‘trigger’ does not perk the decision maker’s curiosity at all, and causal reasoning is not engaged when it should be (Klein and Hoffman 2009). (Hoffman et al., 2011)
	•	reasoning about causation often does not always resolve or have a clear-cut terminus. Indeed, it can be very extended over time and have no clear-cut conclusion, resolution or point of satisfaction. (Hoffman et al., 2011)
	•	Events that occur over time are difficult to link causally if only because they always involve multiple interactive causation (Mill 1882). We have found about a dozen repeating patterns of causal reasoning, and the simple cause-effect chain is one of the least frequent of them (Klein and Hoffman 2009). Other patterns involve complex causation. (Hoffman et al., 2011)
Pattern of causality
	•	There are many patterns to causality and although these can sometimes be known, causality can remain difficult to resolve. (Hoffman et al., 2011)
Swarms
	•	‘swarms’ are multiple converging causes. (Hoffman et al., 2011)
Onions
	•	‘onions’ are when causes are unpacked into other cause-effect relations. (Hoffman et al., 2011)
Spirals
	•	‘spirals’ are when one effect feeds-back to increase the power of some other effect. (Hoffman et al., 2011)
Clockwork
	•	A pattern called ‘clockwork’ is when there are multiple causes that influence one another. (Hoffman et al., 2011)
	•	‘clockwork’ seems common in discussions of the causes of events in economies. (Hoffman et al., 2011)
Dramatic reversible
	•	Explanation by ‘dramatic reversible’ is common in analyses of the outcomes of sporting events. (Hoffman et al., 2011)

Cause
	•	A cause is the reason for some change. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	An analysis of the causes and sources is usefully developed and communicated diagrammatically. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	People have a profound need to believe in something, and in the absence of great unifying belief systems, this void is easily filled by all kinds of microcauses and cults. (Greene, 2018)
CCTV
	•	The CCTV camera is merely another example of modernity’s endless quest for control which makes our civic culture increasingly less tolerant or inclusive and increasingly less capable of trust (Garland 2001:195). (Coker, 2009)
Celebration
	•	L’exaltation eut effectivement déboucher sur la violence : on assiste alors à des manifestations sado-masochistes à caractère mystique (processions de flagellants, amputations délibérément consenties et vouées à la divinité) ou politique. Des révoltes éclatent en embrasements soudains et sauvages (émeutes, jacqueries, soulèvements accompagnés de meurtres, d’atrocités diverses, de pillages). (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Les célébrations et commémorations, tout en relevant par certains côtés de la fête, sont, en général, plus modérées dans leur expression. Leur but fondamental, consécration solennelle d’un souvenir ou exercice liturgique, reste centré sur l’action communautaire. A travers ces procédures renouvelées de glorification du passé où chacun reconnaît ses racines, la société se révèle à elle-même tandis qu’elle exerce ses offices. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Les cérémonies sont, en effet, des conduites collectives hautement ritualisées, s’exprimant d’une manière fixe, suivant une ordonnance réglée qui donne sa stabilité au fait cérémoniel. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	fonction essentielle de stabiliser la vie sociale dans son ensemble en proposant des repères de temps et de lieux, mais aussi des modèles de comportements aux membres de la société. La cérémonie, quelle qu’elle soit (mariage, épreuve initiatique, enterrement), est l’un des principaux véhicules de la conformité sociale et l’on peut même dire qu’en la matière l’exigence de conformité tend à être maximale : le groupe attend activement que chacun participe à un système défini de valeurs religieuses, éthiques ou politiques. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	La fonction psychosociale de la cérémonie est donc évidente : agissant dans le sens d’un conventionnalisme étroit, elle aboutit à un renforcement de la cohérence intragroupale. En un mot, la cérémonie rassemble autant qu’elle célèbre. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	L’adaptation sociale passe donc par l’abandon d’une importante partie des désirs personnels. (Mannoni, 1985)
Celebrity
	•	The celebrity, the spectacular representation of a living human being, embodies this banality by embodying the image of a possible role. Being a star means specializing in the seemingly lived; the star is the object of identification with the shallow seeming life that has to compensate for the fragmented productive specializations which are actually lived. Celebrities exist to act out various styles of living and viewing society unfettered, free to express themselves globally. They embody the inaccessible result of social labor by dramatizing its by-products magically projected above it as its goal: power and vacations, decision and consumption, which are the beginning and end of an undiscussed process. (Debord, 2012)
Cells
	•	Cells are a miniature cyberspace: genetic regulatory networks, protein interaction networks, and metabolic networks are nested into one another; for this reason, some scientists have proposed fusing the conceptso f genome, proteome, metabolome, etc. into the comprehensive idea of interactome. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
	•	Networks in nature and society may very well be fragmented in separated parts. In the cell, some groups of chemicals interact only with each other and with nothing else. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
Cell replication
	•	Genomes often evolve through the process of duplication and diversification. During cell replications, all the DNA is copied to the new cells, but sometimes a mistake happens: a full gene of the original DNA chain is duplicated, and appears twice in the genome of the daughter cell (duplication). Most of the time, this new gene just produces redundant proteins that do the same as its twin. However, in further replications, one of the two can suffer a mutation that may allow its protein to perform new biological functions, for example interacting with different proteins than its former twin (diversification). (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
Censorship
	•	Censorship spells the end of the flow of information on which hierarchy depends, and digs its trap (Douglas, 2005:144)
	•	Censorship, however, will continue in spite of the producers as long as there is a willingness on the part of the public to accept this censorship. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
Ceremony
	•	L’exaltation eut effectivement déboucher sur la violence : on assiste alors à des manifestations sado-masochistes à caractère mystique (processions de flagellants, amputations délibérément consenties et vouées à la divinité) ou politique.

	•	L’adaptation sociale passe donc par l’abandon d’une importante partie des désirs personnels. (Mannoni, 1985)

Certainty
	•	Certainty, like definitely, implies a probability of 100%. (Newsome, 2013)
Challenge
	•	For ‘challenge’ (Lat.: ‘calumnia’, false accusation; Fr.: ‘defi’; Sp.: ‘desafío’, ‘reto’; Port.: ‘desafio’; It.: ‘sfida’; Ger.: ‘Herausforderung’) the synonyms are “confrontation, defiance, interrogation, provocation, question, summons to contest, test, trial, ultimatum”, as well as “questioning, dispute, stand opposition; difficult task, test trial”. (Brauch, 2011)
	•	British English dictionaries offered thesmeanings of the term challenge: “1. something difficult ... that tests strength, skill, or ability...; 2. questioning rightness: a refusal to accept that something is right and legal; 3. invitation to compete: a suggestion to someone that they should try to defeat you in a fight, game etc.; 4. a demand to stop: a demand from someone such as a guard to stop and give proof who you are, and an explanation of what you are doing”; or: “a demanding task or situation”; as well as: “call to try one’s skill or strength; demand to respond or identify oneself; formal objection”; or: “a call to engage in a fight, argument or contest; a questioning of a statement or fact; a demanding or stimulating situation, career, etc.” (Brauch, 2011)
	•	The term ‘challenge’ has often been used for security and global issues but it has hardly been defined, and in many cases it is used synonymously with ‘threat’ (chap. 12 by Brauch).6 Dodds and Schnabel (2001: 42– 43) pointed to ‘new’ and ‘non-traditional’ security challenges as a major concern in the post-cold war se- curity environment. (Brauch, 2011)
Challenge role
	•	‘challenge role’, helping bring discussions away from esoteric science, back to the ‘real world’ (Stilgoe et al., 2006)
Chameleon effect (mirroring)
	•	mirroring people on any level will draw out an empathic response from them. This can be physical, and is known as the chameleon effect. People who are connecting physically and emotionally in a conversation will tend to mimic each other’s gestures and posture, both crossing their legs, for instance. To a degree, you can do this consciously to induce a connection by deliberately mimicking someone. Similarly, nodding your head as they talk and smiling will deepen the connection. Even better, you can enter the spirit of the other person. You absorb their mood deeply and reflect it back to them. You create a feeling of rapport. People secretly crave this emotional rapport in their daily lives, because they get it so rarely. It has a hypnotic effect and appeals to people’s narcissism as you become their mirror. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Also, doing this too strongly and obviously can create a creepy effect. The nodding, smiling, and mirroring at selected moments should be subtle, almost impossible to detect. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Perhaps the best and most exciting sign of all is synchrony, the other person unconsciously mirroring you. Their legs cross in the same direction, the head tilts in a similar manner, one smile inducing another. At the deepest level of synchrony, as Milton Erickson discovered, you will find breathing patterns falling into the same rhythm, which can sometimes end in the complete synchrony of a kiss. (Greene, 2018)
Chance
	•	Chance is commonly viewed as a self-correcting process in which a deviation in one direction induces a deviation in the opposite direction to restore the equilibrium. In fact, deviations are not "corrected" as a chance process unfolds, they are merely diluted. (Tversky and Kahneman, 1974)
	•	When we use the word 'chance' we simply mean the probability of something happening, as for example of a horse we fancied winning a race. (Great Britain and Health and Safety Executive, 1992)
	•	Probability, likelihood, and chance each mean the extent to which something could occur. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Likelihood and chance imply qualitative expressions (using words). (Newsome, 2013)
	•	The prevalence of the word “because” in everyday language reflects the human tendency to seek to identify causes. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Ce que les hommes appellent les chances du sort, c'est-à-dire la ruine, le changement, les éventualités, je les ai toutes prévues. (Dumas, 1998)

Misconceptions of chance
	•	Misconceptions of chance. People expect that a sequence of events generated by a random process will represent the essential characteristics of that process even when the sequence is short. (Tversky and Kahneman, 1974)
	•	Misconceptions of chance are not limited to naive subjects. (Tversky and Kahneman, 1974)
Change
	•	The change is a response to a demand of the times. (Coker, 2009)
Evolutionary change
	•	evolutionary change often goes unnoticed. (Heuer, 1999)
Change of situation
	•	Changes of situation include forced migration or displacement from normal place of residence, homelessness, loss of work, separation from family, loss of rights, and injustice. (Newsome, 2013)
Character
	•	The etymology of the word character, from the ancient Greek, refers to an engraving or stamping instrument. Character, then, is something that is so deeply ingrained or stamped within us that it compels us to act in certain ways, beyond our awareness and control. We can conceive of this character as having three essential components, each layered on top of the other, giving this character depth. (Greene, 2018)
	•	The earliest and deepest layer comes from genetics, from the particular way our brains are wired, which predisposes us toward certain moods and preferences. This genetic component can make some people prone to depression, for instance. It makes some people introverts and others extroverts. It might even incline some toward becoming especially greedy—for attention or privilege or possessions. The psychoanalyst Melanie Klein, who studied infants, believed that the greedy and grasping type of child came into the world predisposed toward this character trait. There might be other genetic factors as well that predispose us toward hostility or anxiety or openness. (Greene, 2018)
	•	The second layer, which forms above this, comes from our earliest years and from the particular type of attachments we formed with our mother and care-givers. In these first three or four years our brains are especially malleable. We experience emotions much more intensely, creating memory traces that are much deeper than anything that will follow. In this period of life we are at our most susceptible to the influence of others, and the stamp from these years is profound. (Greene, 2018)
	•	There are, of course, many gradations within each type and combinations of them, but in every case the quality of attachment that we had in our earliest years will create deep tendencies within us, in particular the way we use relationships to handle or modulate our stress. (Greene, 2018)
	•	In general, from these earliest years people will display a particular tone to their character—hostile and aggressive, secure and confident, anxious and avoidant, needy and enmeshing. These two layers are so deep that we have no real conscious awareness of them and the behavior they compel, unless we expend great effort in examining ourselves. (Greene, 2018)
	•	a third layer will form from our habits and experiences as we get older. Based on the first two layers, we will tend to rely on certain strategies for dealing with stress, looking for pleasure, or handling people. These strategies now become habits that are set in our youth. There will be modifications to the particular nature of our character depending on the people we deal with—friends, teachers, romantic partners—and how they respond to us. (Greene, 2018)
	•	in general these three layers will establish certain noticeable patterns. We will make a particular decision. This is engraved in our brains neurologically. We are compelled to repeat this because the path is already laid. It becomes a habit, and our character is formed out of these thousands of habits, the earliest ones set well before we could be conscious of them. (Greene, 2018)
	•	There is a fourth layer as well. It often is developed in late childhood and adolescence as people become aware of their character flaws. They do what they can to cover them up. If they sense that deep inside they are an anxious, timid type of person, they come to realize that this is not a socially acceptable trait. They learn to disguise it with a front. They compensate by trying to appear outgoing or carefree or even domineering. This makes it all the more difficult for us to determine the nature of their character. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Confidence without Self-awareness and control can become grandiosity. Without conscious effort, these strengths will tend to wear down or turn into weaknesses. What this means is that the weakest parts of our character are the ones that create habits and compulsive behavior, because they do not require effort or practice to maintain. (Greene, 2018)
	•	in studying character is to be aware of these illusions and façades and to train ourselves to look through them. We must scrutinize everybody for signs of their character, no matter the appearance they present or the position they occupy. With this firmly in mind, we can then work on several key components to the skill: recognizing certain signs that people emit in certain situations and that clearly reveal their character; understanding some general categories that people fit into (strong versus weak character, for instance), and finally being aware of certain types of characters that often are the most toxic and should be avoided if possible. (Greene, 2018)
	•	We are locked inside our own character (see chapter 4) and cannot become someone else. (Greene, 2018)
	•	your character was set in your earliest years (see chapter 4), along with your inclinations toward certain activities, your likes and dislikes. As you get older, this character only becomes more apparent. Feeling organically connected to who you were in the past gives you a strong sense of identity. You know what you like and dislike, you know who you are. This will help you maintain your self- love, which is so critical in resisting the descent into deep narcissism and in helping you to develop empathy (see chapter 2). Also, you will pay greater attention to the mistakes and lessons of the past, which those who are locked in the present tend to repress. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Do not be afraid to bring out the more sensitive or ambitious sides to your character. These repressed parts of you are yearning to be let out. In the theater of life, expand the roles that you play. Don’t worry about people’s reactions to any changes in you they sense. You are not so easy to categorize, which will fascinate them and give you the power to play with their perceptions of you, altering them at will. (Greene, 2018)
Character traits
	•	Some character traits can be positive and reflect inner strength. For instance, some people have a propensity toward being generous and open, empathetic, and resilient under pressure. But these stronger, more flexible qualities often require awareness and practice to truly become habits that can be relied upon. (Greene, 2018)
	•	you must come to understand your own character, examining as best you can the elements in your past that have gone into forming it, and the patterns, mostly negative, that you can see recurring in your life. It is impossible to get rid of this stamp that constitutes your character. It is too deep. But through awareness, you can learn to mitigate or stop certain negative patterns. You can work to transform the negative and weak aspects of your character into actual strengths. You can try to create new habits and patterns that go with them through practice, actively shaping your character and the destiny that goes with it. (Greene, 2018)
	•	when we look at people we often are really seeing only their reputation, the myth that surrounds them, the position they occupy, and not the individual. (Greene, 2018)
	•	We are all born as complete beings, with many sides to us. We have qualities of the opposite sex, both genetically and from the influence of the parent of the other gender. Our character has natural depths and dimensions to it. (Greene, 2018)
Conflicting character
	•	we can develop conflicting character traits, perhaps stemming from a difference between our genetic predispositions and our earliest influences, or from parents who stamp in us different values. (Greene, 2018)
	•	The conflicted character, which is developed in the earliest years, will merely reveal a different kind of pattern, with decisions that tend to reflect a person’s ambivalence, or that swing back and forth. (Greene, 2018)
Person character
	•	People’s character is formed in their earliest years and by their daily habits. (Greene, 2018)
	•	 It is what compels them to repeat certain actions in their lives and fall into negative patterns. Look closely at such patterns and remember that people never do something just once. They will inevitably repeat their behavior. Gauge the relative strength of their character by how well they handle adversity, their ability to adapt and work with other people, their patience and ability to learn. Always gravitate toward those who display signs of strength, and avoid the many toxic types out there. Know thoroughly your own character so you can break your compulsive patterns and take control of your destiny. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Train yourself to ignore the front that people display, the myth that surrounds them, and instead plumb their depths for signs of their character. This can be seen in the patterns they reveal from their past, the quality of their decisions, how they have chosen to solve problems, how they delegate authority and work with others, and countless other signs. (Greene, 2018)
	•	If we are honest with ourselves, we must admit there is some truth to the concept of fate. We are prone to repeat the same decisions and methods of dealing with problems. There is a pattern to our life, particularly visible in our mistakes and failures. But there is a different way of looking at this concept: it is not spirits or gods that control us but rather our character. (Greene, 2018)
	•	The most significant indicator of people’s character comes through their actions over time. Despite what people say about the lessons they have learned (see Howard Hughes), and how they have changed over the years, you will inevitably notice the same actions and decisions repeating in the course of their life. In these decisions they reveal their character. (Greene, 2018)
	•	You must take notice of any salient forms of behavior—disappearing when there is too much stress, not completing an important piece of work, turning suddenly belligerent when challenged, or, conversely, suddenly rising to the occasion when given responsibility. With this fixed in your mind, you do some research into their past. You look at other actions you have observed that fit into this pattern, now in retrospect. You pay close attention to what they do in the present. You see their actions not as isolated incidents but as parts of a compulsive pattern. If you ignore the pattern it is your own fault. (Greene, 2018)
	•	people never do something just once. They might try to excuse themselves, to say they lost their heads in the moment, but you can be sure they will repeat whatever foolishness they did on another occasion, compelled by their character and habits. In fact, they will often repeat actions when it is completely against their Self-interest, revealing the compulsive nature of their weaknesses. (Greene, 2018)
	•	It is hard for us to believe that people cannot control tendencies that are so Self-destructive, and we want to give them the benefit of the doubt, as the Romans did. (Greene, 2018)
	•	You can see eloquent signs of people’s character in how they handle everyday affairs. If they are late in finishing simple assignments, they will be late with larger projects. If they become irritated by little inconveniences, they will tend to crumble under larger ones. If they are forgetful on small matters and inattentive to details, they will be so on more important ones. Look at how they treat employees in everyday settings and notice if there are discrepancies between the persona they present and their attitude toward underlings. (Greene, 2018)
	•	In everyday life people can often do well at disguising their character flaws, but in times of stress or crisis these flaws can suddenly become very apparent. People under stress lose their normal Self-control. They reveal their insecurities about their reputation, their fear of failure and lack of inner resilience. On the other hand, some people rise to the occasion and reveal strength under fire. There’s no way to tell until the heat is on, but you must pay extra attention to such moments. (Greene, 2018) 
	•	people can be divided into introverts and extroverts, and this will play a large role in the character they develop. (Greene, 2018)
	•	in general people trend in one or the other direction. It is important to gauge this in others for a simple reason: introverts and extroverts do not naturally understand each other. To the extrovert, the introvert has no fun, is stubborn, even antisocial. To the introvert, the extrovert is shallow, flighty, and overly concerned with what people think. Being one or the other is generally something genetic and will make two people see the same thing in a totally different light. Once you understand you are dealing with someone of the other variety than yourself, you must reassess their character and not foist your own preferences on them. Also, sometimes introverts and extroverts can work well together, particularly if people have a mix of both qualities and they complement each other, but more often than not they do not get along and are prone to constant misunderstandings. Keep in mind that there are generally more extroverts than introverts in the world. (Greene, 2018)
	•	it is critical that you measure the relative strength of people’s character. Think of it in this way: such strength comes from deep within the core of the person. It could stem from a mixture of certain factors—genetics, secure parenting, good mentors along the way, and constant improvement (see the final section of this chapter). Whatever the cause, this strength is not something displayed on the outside in the form of bluster or aggression but manifests itself in overall resilience and adaptability. (Greene, 2018)
	•	We are all a mix of strong and weak qualities, but some people clearly veer in one or the other direction. As much as you can, you want to work and associate with strong characters and avoid weak ones. (Greene, 2018)
	•	In gauging strength or weakness, look at how people handle stressful moments and responsibility. (Greene, 2018)
	•	each person’s character is as unique as a fingerprint. (Greene, 2018)
	•	you have a set character. It was formed out of elements that predate your conscious awareness. From deep within you, this character compels you to repeat certain actions, strategies, and decisions. The brain is structured to facilitate this: once you think and take a particular action, a neural pathway is formed that leads you to do it again and again. And in relation to this law, you can go in one of two directions, each one determining more or less the course of your life. (Greene, 2018)
	•	The first direction is ignorance and denial. You don’t take notice of the patterns in your life; you don’t accept the idea that your earliest years left a deep and lasting imprint that compels you to behave in certain ways. You imagine that your character is completely plastic, and that you can re-create yourself at will. You can follow the same path to power and fame as someone else, even though they come from very different circumstances. (Greene, 2018)
	•	The concept of a set character can seem like a prison, and many people secretly want to be taken outside themselves, through drugs, alcohol, or video games. The result of such denial is simple: the compulsive behavior and the patterns become even more set into place. You cannot move against the grain of your character or wish it away. It is too powerful. (Greene, 2018) Extroverts
	•	Extroverts are largely governed by external criteria. The question that dominates them is “What do others think of me?” They will tend to like what other people like, and the groups they belong to frequently determine the opinions they hold. They are open to suggestion and new ideas, but only if they are popular in the culture or asserted by some authority they respect. Extroverts value external things—good clothes, great meals, concrete enjoyment shared with others. They are in search of new and novel sensations and have a nose for trends. They are not only comfortable with noise and bustle but actively search it out. If they are bold, they love physical adventure. If they are not so bold, they love creature comforts. In any event, they crave stimulation and attention from others. (Greene, 2018)
	•	extroverts, who are fascinated by facts and statistics for their own sake. (Greene, 2018)
	•	in general people trend in one or the other direction. It is important to gauge this in others for a simple reason: introverts and extroverts do not naturally understand each other. To the extrovert, the introvert has no fun, is stubborn, even antisocial. To the introvert, the extrovert is shallow, flighty, and overly concerned with what people think. Being one or the other is generally something genetic and will make two people see the same thing in a totally different light. Once you understand you are dealing with someone of the other variety than yourself, you must reassess their character and not foist your own preferences on them. Also, sometimes introverts and extroverts can work well together, particularly if people have a mix of both qualities and they complement each other, but more often than not they do not get along and are prone to constant misunderstandings. Keep in mind that there are generally more extroverts than introverts in the world. The only way to do so is to work on your habits, which go into the slow formation of your character.  (Greene, 2018)
	•	you need to also refine or cultivate those traits that go into a strong character—resilience under pressure, attention to detail, the ability to complete things, to work with a team, to be tolerant of people’s differences. (Greene, 2018)
Introverts
	•	Introverts are more sensitive and easily exhausted by too much outward activity. They like to conserve their energy, to spend time alone or with one or two close friends. As opposed to extroverts, who are fascinated by facts and statistics for their own sake, introverts are interested in their own opinions and feelings. They love to theorize and come up with their own ideas. If they produce something, they do not like to promote it; they find the effort distasteful. What they make should sell itself. They like to keep a part of their life separate from others, to have secrets. Their opinions do not come from what others think or from any authority but from their inner criteria, or at least they think so. (Greene, 2018)
	•	The bigger the crowd, the more lost and lonely they feel. They can seem awkward and mistrustful, uncomfortable with attention. They also tend to be more pessimistic and worried than the average extrovert. Their boldness will be expressed by the novel ideas they come up with and their creativity. (Greene, 2018)
	•	in general people trend in one or the other direction. It is important to gauge this in others for a simple reason: introverts and extroverts do not naturally understand each other. To the extrovert, the introvert has no fun, is stubborn, even antisocial. To the introvert, the extrovert is shallow, flighty, and overly concerned with what people think. Being one or the other is generally something genetic and will make two people see the same thing in a totally different light.

Keep in mind that there are generally more extroverts than introverts in the world. (Greene, 2018)
Strong character
	•	A person of strong character is like gold—rare but invaluable. They can adapt, learn, and improve themselves. Since your success depends on the people you work with and for, make their character the primary object of your attention. You will spare yourself the misery of discovering their character when it is too late. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Strong character has a tensile quality like a good piece of metal—it can give and bend but still retains its overall shape and never breaks. The strength emanates from a feeling of personal security and Self-worth. This allows such people to take criticism and learn from their experiences. This means they do not give up so easily, since they want to learn how to get better. They are rigorously persistent. People of strong character are open to new ideas and ways of doing things without compromising the basic principles they adhere to. In adversity they can retain their presence of mind. They can handle chaos and the unpredictable without succumbing to anxiety. They keep their word. They have patience, can organize a lot of material, and complete what they start. Not continually insecure about their status, they can also subsume their personal interests to the good of the group, knowing that what works best for the team will in the end make their life easier and better. (Greene, 2018)
	•	People of real strength are as rare as gold, and if you find them, you should respond as if you had a discovered a treasure. (Greene, 2018)
Toxic character
	•	As opposed to the more obviously evil or manipulative characters that you can spot a mile away, these types are trickier. They often lure you in with an appearance that presents their weaknesses as something positive. Only over time do you see the toxic nature beneath the appearance, often when it is too late. Your best defense is to be armed with knowledge of these types, to notice the signs earlier on, and to not get involved or to disengage from them as quickly as possible. (Greene, 2018)
Big talker
	•	You are impressed by their ideas, the projects that they are thinking about. They need help, they need backers, and you are sympathetic, but step back for a moment and examine their record for signs of past achievements or anything tangible. You might be dealing with a type that is not overtly dangerous but can prove maddening and waste your valuable time. (Greene, 2018)
	•	In essence, these people are ambivalent. On the one hand they are secretly afraid of the effort and responsibility that go with translating their ideas into action. On the other hand, they crave attention and power. The two sides go to war within them, but the anxious part inevitably wins out and they slip away at the last moment. They come up with some reason for getting out of it, after you have committed to them. They themselves never finish anything. In the end, they tend to blame others for not realizing their visions—society, nebulous antagonistic forces, or bad luck. Or they try to find a sucker who will do all of the hard work in bringing to life their vague idea but who will take the blame if it all goes wrong. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Often such people had parents who were inconsistent, would turn on them suddenly for the smallest misdeed. Consequently their goal in life is to avoid situations in which they might open themselves up to criticism and judgment. They handle this by learning to talk well and impressing people with stories but running away when called to account, always with an excuse. Look carefully at their past for signs of this, and if they seem the type, be amused by their stories but take it no further. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Grandiose people are generally big talkers. They take credit for anything that is even tangential to their work; they invent past successes. They talk of their prescience, how they foresaw certain trends or predicted certain events, none of which can be verified. All such talk should make you doubly dubious. If people in the public eye suddenly say something that gets them into trouble for being insensitive, you can ascribe that to their potent grandiosity. They are so attuned to their own great opinions that they assume everyone else will interpret them in the right spirit and agree with them. (Greene, 2018)
Drama Magnet
	•	They will draw you in with their exciting presence. They have unusual energy and stories to tell. Their features are animated and they can be quite witty. They are fun to be around, until the drama turns ugly. (Greene, 2018)
	•	As children, they learned that the only way to get love and attention that lasted was to enmesh their parents in their troubles and problems, which had to be large enough to engage the parents emotionally over time. This became a habit, their way of feeling alive and wanted. Most people shrink from any kind of confrontation, but they seem to live for it. As you get to know them better, you hear more stories of bickering and battles in their life, but they manage to always position themselves as the victim. (Greene, 2018)
	•	You must realize that their greatest need is to get their hooks into you by any means possible. They will embroil you in their drama to the point that you will feel guilty for disengaging. (Greene, 2018)
	•	It is best to recognize them as early as possible, before you become enmeshed and dragged down. Examine their past for evidence of the pattern and run for the hills if you suspect you are dealing with such a type. (Greene, 2018)
Easy moralizer
	•	They communicate a sense of outrage at this bit of injustice or that, and they are quite eloquent. With such conviction they find followers, including you. But sometimes you detect cracks in their righteous veneer.  (Greene, 2018)
	•	They don’t treat their employees so well; they are condescending to their spouse; they may have a secret life or vice you catch glimpses of.  (Greene, 2018)
	•	As children, they were often made to feel guilty for their own strong impulses and desires for pleasure. They were punished and tried to repress these impulses. Because of this they develop some self-loathing and are quick to project negative qualities onto others or look enviously at people who are not so repressed. They don’t like other people enjoying themselves. Instead of expressing their envy, they choose to judge and condemn. You will notice in the adult version a complete lack of nuance. People are good or evil, no middle ground. They are in fact at war with human nature, incapable of coming to terms with our less-than-perfect traits.  (Greene, 2018)
	•	Their morality is as easy and compulsive as drinking or gambling, and it requires no sacrifices on their part, just a lot of noble words. They thrive in a culture of political correctness.In truth they are secretly drawn toward what they condemn, which is why they will inevitably have a secret side. You will certainly be the target of their inquisition at some point if you get too close to them. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Notice their lack of empathy early on and keep your distance. (Greene, 2018)
Hyperperfectionists
	•	You are lured into their circle by how hard they work, how dedicated they are to making the best of whatever it is they produce. They put in longer hours than even the lowliest employee. (Greene, 2018)
	•	they might explode and yell at people below them for not doing the job right, but that is because they want to maintain the highest standards, and that should be a good thing. (Greene, 2018)
	•	if you have the misfortune of agreeing to work with or for such a type, you will slowly discover the reality. They cannot delegate tasks; they have to oversee everything. It is less about high standards and dedication to the group than about power and control. Such people often have dependency issues stemming from their family background, similar to Howard Hughes. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Any feeling that they might have to depend on someone for something opens up old wounds and anxieties. They can’t trust anyone. Once their back is turned, they imagine everyone slacking off. Their compulsive need to micromanage leads to people feeling resentful and secretly resistant, which is precisely what they fear the most. (Greene, 2018)
	•	You will notice that the group they lead is not very well organized, since everything must flow through them. This leads to chaos and political infighting as the courtiers struggle to get closer to the king, who controls everything. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Hyperperfectionists will often have health problems, as they work themselves to the bone. They like to blame others for everything that goes wrong—nobody is working hard enough. (Greene, 2018)
	•	They have patterns of initial success followed by burnout and spectacular failures. It is best to recognize the type before getting enmeshed on any level. (Greene, 2018)
	•	They cannot be satisfied by anything you do and will chew you up slowly with their anxieties, abusiveness, and desire to control. (Greene, 2018)
	•	If you are a hyperperfectionist who likes to control everything, you must redirect this energy into some productive work instead of using it on people. Your attention to detail and high standards are a positive, if you channel them correctly. (Greene, 2018)
Relentless rebel
	•	At first glance such people can seem quite exciting. They hate authority and love the underdog. Almost all of us are secretly attracted to such an attitude; it appeals to the adolescent within us, the desire to snub our nose at the teacher. They don’t recognize rules or precedents. Following conventions is for those who are weak and stodgy. (Greene, 2018)
	•	These types will often have a biting sense of humor, which they might turn on you, but that is part of their authenticity, their need to deflate everyone, or so you think. But if you happen to associate with this type more closely, you will see that it is something they cannot control; it is a compulsion to feel superior, not some higher moral quality. (Greene, 2018)In their childhood a parent or father figure probably disappointed them. They came to mistrust and hate all those in power. In the end, they cannot accept any criticism from others because that reeks of authority. They cannot ever be told what to do. Everything must be on their terms. If you cross them in some way, you will be painted as the oppressor and be the brunt of their vicious humor. (Greene, 2018)
	•	They gain attention with this rebel pose and soon become addicted to the attention. In the end it is all about power—no one shall be above them, and anyone who dares will pay the price. Look at their past history—they will tend to split with people on very bad terms, made worse by their insults. Do not be lured in by the hipness of their rebel pose. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Such types are eternally locked in adolescence, and to try work with them will prove as productive as trying to lock horns with a sullen teenager. (Greene, 2018)
	•	If you have a rebellious character, you have a natural dislike of conventions and the usual ways of doing things. Channel this into some kind of innovative work, instead of compulsively insulting and alienating people. (Greene, 2018)
Personalizer
	•	These people seem so sensitive and thoughtful, a rare and nice quality. They might seem a little sad, but sensitive people can have it rough in life. You are often drawn in by this air of theirs, and want to help. Also, they can appear quite intelligent, considerate, and good to work with. What you come to realize later on is that their sensitivity really only goes in one direction—inward. (Greene, 2018)
	•	They are prone to take everything that people say or do as personal. They tend to brood over things for days, long after you have forgotten some innocuous comment that they have taken personally. As children, they had a gnawing feeling that they never got enough from their parents—love, attention, material possessions. As they get older, everything tends to remind them of what they didn’t get. (Greene, 2018)
	•	They go through life resenting this and wanting others to give them things without their having to ask. They are constantly on guard—are you paying them attention, do you respect them, are you giving them what they paid for? Being somewhat irritable and touchy, they inevitably push people away, which makes them even more sensitive. At some point they start to have a look of perpetual disappointment. (Greene, 2018) 
	•	You will see in their life a pattern of many falling-outs with people, but they will always see themselves as the wronged party. Do not ever inadvertently insult such a type. They have a long memory and can spend years getting back at you. If you can recognize the type early enough, it’s better to avoid them, as they will inevitably make you feel guilty for something. (Greene, 2018)
	•	If you are highly sensitive and prone to take things personally, you can work to redirect this into active empathy (see chapter 2), and transform this flaw into an asset to use for positive social purposes. (Greene, 2018)
Pleaser
	•	You have never met anyone so nice and considerate. You almost can’t believe how accommodating and charming they are. Then slowly you begin to have some doubts, but nothing you can put your finger on. Perhaps they don’t show up as promised or don’t do a job so well. It is subtle. The further this goes, however, the more it seems like they are sabotaging you or talking behind your back. (Greene, 2018)
	•	These types are consummate courtiers, and they have developed their niceness not out of a genuine affection for their fellow humans but as a defense mechanism. Perhaps they had harsh and punishing parents who scrutinized their every action. Smiling and a deferential front was their way of deflecting any form of hostility, and it becomes their pattern for life. They also probably resorted to lying to their parents, and they are generally practiced and expert liars. Just as when they were children, behind the smiles and flattery is a great deal of resentment at the role they have to play. (Greene, 2018)
	•	They secretly yearn to harm or steal from the person they serve or defer to. You must be on your guard with people who actively exert so much charm and politeness, past the point of what is natural. They can turn out to be quite passive-aggressive, particularly hitting you when your guard is down. (Greene, 2018)
	•	If you are a pleaser, you have developed courtier skills and real charm. If you can see the source of this trait, you can control the compulsive and defensive aspect of it and use it as a genuine social skill that can bring you great power. (Greene, 2018)
Prince/Princess
	•	They will draw you in with their regal air. They are calm and ever so slightly imbued with a feeling of superiority. It is pleasant to meet people who appear confident and destined to wear a crown. Slowly you might find yourself doing favors for them, working extra hard for no pay, and not really understanding how or why. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Somehow they express the need to be taken care of, and they are masters at getting others to pamper them. In childhood, their parents indulged them in their slightest whim and protected them from any kind of harsh intrusion from the outside world. There are also some children who incite this behavior in their parents by acting especially helpless. Whatever the cause, as adults their greatest desire is to replicate this early pampering. It remains their lost paradise. 
	•	You will notice often that when they don’t get what they want, they display baby-like behavior, pouting, or even tantrums. This is certainly the pattern for all of their intimate relationships, and unless you have a deep need to pamper others, you will find the relationship maddening, always on their terms. (Greene, 2018)
	•	They are not equipped to handle the harsh aspects of adult life and either manipulate a person into the pampering role or resort to drinking and drugs to soothe themselves. If you feel guilty for not helping them, it means you are hooked and should look to take care of yourself instead. (Greene, 2018)
Savior
	•	You cannot believe your good luck—you have met someone who will save you from your difficulties and troubles. Somehow they recognized your need for help and here they are with books to read, strategies to employ, the right foods to eat. In the beginning it is all quite seductive, but your doubts begin the moment you want to assert your independence and do things on your own. (Greene, 2018)
	•	In childhood, these types often had to become the caregivers of their own mother, father, or siblings. The mother, for instance, made her own needs the primary concern of the family. Such children compensate for the lack of care that they receive with the feeling of power that they derive from the inverted relationship. This sets a pattern: they gain their greatest satisfaction from rescuing people, from being the caregiver and savior. They have a nose for those in possible need of salvation. (Greene, 2018)
	•	you can detect the compulsive aspect of this behavior by their need to control you. If they are willing to let you stand on your own two feet after some initial help, then they are truly noble. If not, it is really about the power they can exercise. In any event, it is always best to cultivate Self-reliance and tell saviors to save themselves. (Greene, 2018)
Sexualizer
	•	They seem charged with sexual energy, in a way that is refreshingly unrepressed. They have a tendency to mix work with pleasure, to blur the usual boundaries for when it is appropriate to use this energy, and you might imagine that this is healthy and natural. But in truth it is compulsive and comes from a dark place. (Greene, 2018)
	•	In their earliest years such people probably suffered sexual abuse in some way. This could have been directly physical or something more psychological, which the parent expressed through looks and touching that was subtle but inappropriate. A pattern is deeply set from within and cannot be controlled—they will tend to see every relationship as potentially sexual. Sex becomes a means of Self-validation, and when they are young, such types can lead an exciting, promiscuous life, as they will tend to find people to fall under their spell. But as they get older, any long periods without this validation can lead to depression and suicide, so they become more desperate. (Greene, 2018)
	•	If they occupy positions of leadership, they will use their power to get what they want, all under the guise of being natural and unrepressed. The older they get, the more pathetic and frightening this becomes. You cannot help or save them from their compulsion, only save yourself from entanglement with them on any level. (Greene, 2018)
Weak characer
	•	People of weak character begin from the opposite position. They are easily overwhelmed by circumstances, making them hard to rely upon. They are slippery and evasive. Worst of all, they cannot be taught because learning from others implies criticism. This means you will continually hit a wall in dealing with them. They may appear to listen to your instructions, but they will simply revert to what they think is best. (Greene, 2018)
	•	weak character will neutralize all of the other possible good qualities a person might possess. For instance, people of high intelligence but weak character may come up with good ideas and even do a job well, but they will crumble under pressure, or they will not take to kindly to criticism, or they will think first and foremost of their own agenda, or their arrogance and annoying qualities will cause others around them to quit, harming the general environment. There are hidden costs to working with them or hiring them. Someone less charming and intelligent but of strong character will prove more reliable and productive over the long run. (Greene, 2018)
	•	People of real strength are as rare as gold, and if you find them, you should respond as if you had a discovered a treasure. (Greene, 2018)
Charisma
	•	the ability to express eloquently emotions they are feeling, which inevitably stirs parallel emotions in others. But some of them can also be quite narcissistic; they project their internal drama and troubles outward, catching other people up in the turmoil they create. This leads to profound feelings of attraction in some and repulsion in others. (Greene, 2018)
	•	It is best to recognize these inflamers by how they affect others, not just yourself. No one can remain indifferent to them. People find themselves incapable of reasoning or maintaining any distance in their presence. They make you think of them continually when not in their presence. (Greene, 2018)
	•	They have an obsessive quality, and they can lead you to extreme actions as a devoted follower or as an inveterate enemy. (Greene, 2018)
	•	On either end of the spectrum—attraction or repulsion—you will tend to be irrational and you will desperately need to distance yourself. A good strategy to utilize is to see through the front they project. They inevitably try to cast a larger-than-life image, a mythic, intimidating quality; but in fact they are all too human, full of the same insecurities and weaknesses we all possess. Try to recognize these very human traits and demythologize them. (Greene, 2018)
Charismatic individuals
	•	In many cases charismatic individuals can make or break outcomes. (Löfstedt, 2005)
Charismatic speaker
	•	That person seems to be invested with some sort of special force that commands our respect and fills us with increasing excitement. (Greene, 2018)
Charities
	•	Charities accept risks that otherwise would not be covered by those exposed, perhaps because they are too poor inmaterial terms or too poorly represented. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Charities often appear in response to crisis. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Charities are the least certain of the actors to which we could transfer our risks, since they themselves usually rely on voluntary donations and their reserves tend to be unpredictable and particular in form. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Few people give to charities anonymously—they want their names loudly advertised.You must never inadvertently cast doubts on this saintly self- opinion. To make positive use of this trait in people, frame what you are asking them to do as part of a larger cause that they can participate in. They are not merely buying clothes but helping the environment or keeping jobs local. In taking these actions, people can feel better about themselves. (Greene, 2018)
Charm
	•	people will charm and flatter us and, blinded by our desire to like them, we fail to look deeper and see the character flaws. (Greene, 2018)
Passive-aggressive charmer
	•	These types are amazingly nice and accommodating when you first meet them, so much so that you tend to let them into your life rather quickly. They smile a lot. They are upbeat and always willing to help. At some point, you may return the favor by hiring them for a job or helping them in their careers. You will detect along the way some cracks in the veneer—perhaps they make a somewhat critical comment out of the blue, or you hear from friends that they have been talking about you behind your back. Then something ugly occurs—a blowup, some act of sabotage or betrayal—so unlike that nice, charming person you first befriended. (Greene, 2018)
	•	The truth is that these types realize early on in life that they have aggressive, envious tendencies that are hard to control. They want power. They intuit that such inclinations will make life hard for them. Over many years they cultivate the opposite façade—their niceness has an almost aggressive edge. Through this stratagem they are able to gain social power. But they secretly resent having to play such a role and be so deferential. They can’t maintain it. Under stress or simply worn out by the effort, they will lash out and hurt you. They can do this well now that they know you and your weak spots. They will, of course, blame you for what ensues.Your best defense is to be wary of people who are too quick to charm and befriend, too nice and accommodating at first. Such extreme niceness is never natural. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Keep your distance and look for some early signs, such as passive-aggressive comments. If you notice that—somewhat out of character—they indulge in malicious gossip about someone, you can be sure the Shadow is speaking and that you will be the target of such gossip one day. (Greene, 2018)
Chaos
	•	all of this chaos is exponentially increased by the information available through technology. (Greene, 2014)
	•	When allowed a bit of uncertainty, presumed to be the active ingredient of forecasting, chaos has reignited a centuries-old debate on the nature of the world. (Smith and Smith, 2007) 
	•	The concept now called ‘chaos’ has its origins both in science fiction and in science fact. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
	•	The mathematical version of this concept is known as sensitive dependence. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
	•	Chaos is important, in part, because it helps us to cope with unstable systems by improving our ability to describe, to understand, perhaps even to forecast them. Indeed, one of the myths of chaos we will debunk is that chaos makes forecasting a useless task. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
	•	Chaos is the name given to the mechanism which allows such rapid growth of uncertainty in our mathematical models. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
	•	this sensitivity is no threat as long as there is no uncertainty in the position of the points. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
	•	Chaos impacts the ways and means of weather forecasting, which affect us directly through the weather, and indirectly through economic consequences both of the weather and of the forecasts themselves. Chaos also plays a role in questions of climate change and our ability to foresee the strength and impacts of global warming. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
	•	Chaos has also had a major impact on the sciences, forcing a close re-examination of what scientists mean by the words ‘error’ and ‘uncertainty’ and how these meanings change when applied to our world and our models. As Whitehead noted, it is dangerous to interpret our mathematical models as if they somehow governed the real world. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
	•	In his 1927 Gifford Lectures, Sir Arthur Eddington went to the heart of the problem of chaos: some things are trivial to predict, especially if they have to do with mathematics itself, while other things seem predictable, sometimes. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
	•	The story of chaos is important because it enables us to see the world from the perspective of each of these players. Are we merely developing the mathematical language with which the game is played?. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
	•	chaos emerged from the noise of traditional linear statistics. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
	•	Before the nonlinear dynamics of chaos were widely recognized within science, these questions fell primarily in the domain of the philosophers.. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
	•	observational uncertainties are said to be caused by noise. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
	•	A small error in the initial number of rabbits results in a very large error in the forecast. In fact, the error is growing exponentially in time. This has many implications. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
	•	Chaos is a property of dynamical systems. And a dynamical system is nothing more than a source of changing observations. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
	•	There are at least three different kinds of dynamical systems. Chaos is most easily defined in mathematical dynamical systems. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
	•	chaos is a property of a dynamical system with fixed equations (structure) and specified parameter values, so the uncertainty that chaos acts on is only the uncertainty in the initial state. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
	•	Chaos is only found in deterministic systems. But to understand its impact on science we need to view it against the background of traditional stochastic models developed over the past century. Whenever we see something repetitive in nature, periodic motion is one of the first hypotheses to be deployed. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
	•	The study of chaos has clarified the importance of distinguishing two different issues: one being the effects of uncertainty in the state or the parameters, the other being the inadequacy of our mathematics itself. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
	•	Motion caused by two competing forces often gives rise to chaos. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
	•	methods of analysis developed for chaos may prove of value in practice regardless of the nature of the underlying dynamics of the real systems that generate the signals analysed. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
	•	Chaos and nonlinearity impact many fields. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
	•	the word ‘chaos’ is used to describe the dynamics of the system. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
	•	Chaos exposes our prejudices when we examine the dynamics of uncertainty. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
	•	chaos does not imply that prediction is hopeless. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
	•	It is well known that correlation does not imply causation; the study of chaos has made it clear that causation does not imply (linear) correlation either. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
	•	One of the insights of chaos is to focus on information content. In linear systems variance reflects information content. Information content is more subtle in nonlinear systems, where size is not the only indicator of importance. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
	•	Chaos is defined in the long run. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
	•	chaos does not imply prediction is hopeless. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
	•	We are always putting the wrong numbers into our machines; the study of chaos has refocused interest in determining whether or not any ‘right numbers’ exist. Prediction allows us to examine the connection between our models and the real world in two somewhat different ways. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
	•	Chaos poses no prediction problems for Laplace’s demon: given exact initial conditions, a perfect model and the power to make exact calculations, it can trace a chaotic system forward in time as accurately as it can a periodic system. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
	•	The study of chaos suggests that difficulty lies not with uncertainty in the number to ‘put in’ but the lack of an empirically adequate model to put anything into: chaos we might cope with, but it is model inadequacy, not chaos, that limits predictability. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
	•	The study of chaos has initiated a rethink of modelling and clarified the restrictions on what we can see through our models. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
	•	coming to understand chaos and nonlinear dynamics has improved both the experimental design in and the practice of climate studies, allowing more insightful decision support for policy makers. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
	•	When a large number of people are playing a game with clear rules but unknown dynamics, it is hard to distinguish those who win with skill from those who win by chance. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
	•	We must contend both with observational uncertainty and with model inadequacy. Interpreting an ensemble forecast of the real world as if it were a perfect model probability forecast of a mathematical system is to make the most naïve of forecasting blunders. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
	•	If we stay with mathematical standards of proof, then very few systems can be proven to be chaotic. The definition of mathematical chaos can only be applied to mathematical systems, so we cannot begin to prove a physical system is chaotic, or periodic for that matter. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
	•	if our best models of a physical system appear to be chaotic, if they are deterministic, appear to be recurrent, and suggest sensitive dependence by exhibiting the rapid growth of small uncertainties, then these facts provide a working definition of what it means for a physical system to be chaotic. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
	•	The study of chaos helps us to see more clearly which questions make sense and which are truly nonsensical: the study of chaotic dynamics has forced us to accept that some of our goals are unreachable given the awkward properties of nonlinear systems. And given that our best models of the world are nonlinear – models for the weather, the economy, epidemics, the brain, the Moore-Spiegel circuit, even the Earth’s climate system – this insight has implications beyond science, extending to decision support and policy making. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
	•	All difficult decisions are made under uncertainty; understanding chaos has helped us to provide better decision support. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
Burn effect
	•	The Burns effect places the focus firmly on us and our attempts to make rational decisions in the real world given only collections of different simulations under various imperfect models. The failure to distinguish between reality and our models, between observations and mathematics, arguably between an empirical fact and scientific fiction, is the root of much confusion regarding chaos both by the public and among scientists. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
Chaotic behaviour
	•	chaotic behaviour where small changes in initial conditions (‘the flapping of a butterfly’s wings in Argentina’) produce large later changes (‘a hurricane in the Caribbean’). (Holland, 2014)

Chaotic dynamics
	•	Chaotic dynamics is usually modeled by the action of a set of coupled nonlinear differential equations. (Hayes, 2005)
Chaotic model
	•	In any chaotic model, almost all nearby initial states will eventually diverge. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
Chaotic systems
	•	Chaotic systems not only exhibit sensitive dependence, but two other properties as well: they are deterministic, and they are nonlinear. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
	•	a nonlinear system will show a disproportionate response. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
	•	Nonlinear systems need not, giving nonlinearity a critical role in the origin of sensitive dependence. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
	•	chaotic systems are nonlinear, they are deterministic, and they are unstable in that they display sensitivity to initial condition. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
	•	on average a small uncertainty will grow exponentially fast in a chaotic system.  (Smith and Smith, 2007)
	•	In practice there is an art of ‘tuning’ parameter values. And while nonlinearity requires us to reconsider how we find ‘good parameter values’, chaos will force us to re-evaluate what we mean by ‘good’. A very small difference in the value of a parameter which has an unnoticeable impact on the quality of a short-term forecast can alter the shape of an attractor beyond recognition. Systems in which this happens are called structurally unstable. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
	•	If the model state has more than one component, then uncertainty in one of its components can contribute to future uncertainty in other components. This brings in a whole new set of mathematical issues, since the order in which you multiply things together becomes important. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
	•	Predicting chaotic systems is far from hopeless, betting against someone who naïvely believes it is hopeless might even prove profitable. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
Chaos theory
	•	Now reducing the uncertainty in a measurement is rarely free (we have to hire someone else to count the rabbits a second time), and large reductions of uncertainty can be expensive, so when uncertainty grows exponentially fast, the cost sky-rockets. (Smith and Smith, 2007).
Strange attractor
	•	We can see them as ‘strange attractors’ in the jargon of chaos theory. The fractal nature of reality means that it is not possible for the analyst to plot an exact course from here to the future to establish into which orbit we will be pulled, and thus in which future we will end up. (Omand, 2014)
Fractal of chaos
	•	the fractals of chaos are mathematical objects found in state spaces. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
Imperfect chaotic models
	•	In imperfect chaotic models, we cannot get the noise to allow a coherent account of the difference between our models and the observations. Model error and observational noise are inextricably mixed together. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
Mathematical chaos
	•	This book traces out the remarkable richness that follows from three simple constraints, which we’ll call sensitivity, determinism, and recurrence. These constraints allow mathematical chaos: behaviour that looks random, but is not random. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
Chekov
	•	His approach in these cases was to imagine that each person, no matter how twisted, has a reason for what they’ve become, a logic that makes sense to them. In their own way, they are striving for fulfillment, but irrationally. By stepping back and imagining their story from the inside, Chekhov demythologized the brutes and aggressors; he cut them down to human size. (Greene, 2018)
Chemical intake rate
	•	The chemical intake rate is the amount of chemical crossing the outer boundary per unit of time. which is the product or the concentration in the media times the ingestion or inhalation rate. (Paustenbach, 2002a)
	•	A chemical uptake rate is the amount (alchemical absorbed per unit of time. In this process. mass transfer occurs by diffusion. so uptake will depend on the concentration gradient across the boundary. permeability of the barrier. and other factors. (Paustenbach, 2002a)
	•	Chemical uptake rates can be expressed as a function of the exposure concentration, permeability coefficient. and surface area exposed. or as flux. (Paustenbach, 2002a)
Chemical policy
Sound chemical policy
	•	A sound chemical policy would promote the use of safe chemicals, and quickly identify and manage those few dangerous chemicals that cause cancer; neurological or development disabilities; or are otherwise devastating to human health. (U.S. Senate Committee on Environment & Public Works, 2006)
	•	A sound chemicals policy accepts the limits of science and enables decisionmakers to make decisions without waiting for full proof of cause and effect, which is all the more important considering that such proof is virtually unobtainable, unless damage already occurred, by when it is too late. (Schorling, 2003)
Chernobyl effect
	•	the idea that risk comes free of responsibility for that risks (Beard, 2011)
Chief Scientific Adviser
	•	As a Chief Scientific Adviser, one of my principal roles is to ensure that there is a constructive dialogue between the scientific community and the policy-makers (and those who implement policy) within this grey area of uncertainty. Part of this role is also to make clear where the certainty of the scientific evidence stops and where un- certainty begins. (Boyd, 2013)
Chilhood
	•	we all secretly mourn for the child part of our character we have lost—the wildness, the spontaneity, the intensity of experience, the open mind. Our overall energy is diminished by the loss. (Greene, 2018)
Earlychilhood
	•	In early childhood we were at our most sensitive and vulnerable. Our relationship to our parents had a much greater impact on us the further back in time we go. (Greene, 2018)
Children
	•	Children are naturally creative. They actively transform everything around them, play with ideas and circumstances, and surprise us with the novel things they say or do. But the natural creativity of children is limited; it never leads to discoveries, inventions, or substantial works of art. (Greene, 2014)
	•	When we were children, we were almost all great observers of people. Because we were small and weak, our survival depended on decoding people’s smiles and tones of voice. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Children quickly see through their front. Slowly, from the age of five onward, this sensitivity is lost as we start to turn inward and become more concerned with how others see us. (Greene, 2018)
	•	As children, our minds were much more fluid and open. We would make the most surprising and creative associations between ideas. But as we get older, we tend to tighten this down. We live in a sophisticated, high-tech world dominated by statistics and ideas gleaned from big data. Free associations between ideas, images from dreams, hunches, and intuitions seem irrational and subjective. But this leads to the most sterile forms of thinking. The unconscious, the Shadow side of the mind, has powers we must learn to tap into. And in fact some of the most creative people in our midst actively engage this side of thinking. (Greene, 2018)
Greedy children
	•	The earliest and deepest layer comes from genetics, from the particular way our brains are wired, which predisposes us toward certain moods and preferences. This genetic component can make some people prone to depression, for instance. It makes some people introverts and others extroverts. It might even incline some toward becoming especially greedy—for attention or privilege or possessions. The psychoanalyst Melanie Klein, who studied infants, believed that the greedy and grasping type of child came into the world predisposed toward this character trait. There might be other genetic factors as well that predispose us toward hostility or anxiety or openness. (Greene, 2018)
Choice
	•	Choice presupposes alternatives between which to choose; it presupposes a society which contains and encourages "different opinions" (page 249), "antagonistic modes of thought," 45 as well as "different experiments of living'' (page 249), so that the "worth of different modes of life is proved not just in the imagination, but practically" (page 250). (Feyerabend, 1993)
Chronicle
	•	The chronicle is the expression of the irreversible time of power. It is also the instrument which preserves the voluntaristic progression of this time. Time begins with the end of the predecessor, since this orien-1 29tation of time collapses with the force of every particular power, falling back to the indifferent oblivion of the only cyclical time known to the peasant masses who, during the collapse of empires and their chronolo­ gies, never change. (Debord, 2012)
Chronic reference dose
	•	The chronic reference dose (RID) is defined as—an estimate (with uncertainty spanning perhaps an order of magnitude) of a daily oral exposure to the human population (including sensitive subgroups) that is likely to he without an appreciable risk of deleterious effects during a lifetime" (page 11). (Williams and Paustenbach, 2002)
Chronic reference concentration
	•	The chronic reference concentration (RfC) has the same definition, except it refers to "continuous inhalation exposure" over a life-time (page 11). (Williams and Paustenbach, 2002)
Citation
	•	Researchers recognize this by citing several older publications at the end of their papers. Citations provide recognition of relevant results of the past, give credibility to new results and make reference to facts, technologies, and experiments that are accepted as valid, or criticized, within a work. Publications have been extensively standardized in recent years: articles are mostly in English, control methods have been homogenized (mainly through peer review), measures of impact have been devised, etc. At the same time, large electronic databases of publications have been established, with thousands of new items being added every day: articles, books, patents, projects, etc. All this produces a large network of publications: two items are connected if one of them cites the other. We can also identify authorship from these databases and create networks of collaborations between scientists. These systems are increasingly used to map and visualize the development of knowledge and the most active areas of science. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
	•	The most exact realization of this case if the network of citations within scientific papers. New papers appear every day, with citations to older ones, and once they are published, the respective citations cannot be changed any more. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
Citizen
	•	[…] citizens in democratic societies are not willing to manage all hazardous organizations as if they were “total institutions,” completely isolating their members from broader social life, socializing them into conformity, and controlling every aspect of their behavior. (Sagan, 1995)
	•	Citizens believe that governmental officials regard them as unwanted intruders in the decision making process. (Webler and Renn, 1995)
Citizen advisory committees
	•	Citizen advisory committees (CACs), a group of individuals appointed “for the purposes of examining an issue or set of issues” (10) meet over a longer term than public meetings or workshops and thus are believed to encourage more extensive interaction. (Chess and Purcell, 1999)
	•	although CACs are reputed to allow meaningful interaction among participants, other studies suggest that agencies hampered citizens’ ability to play meaningful roles. (Chess and Purcell, 1999)
	•	CAC organizers typically seem to use two criteria to select participants: They represent established interest groups or interest positions that the problem owner deems to be relevant, they are seen as legitimate representatives of a constituency. (Vari, 1995)
	•	The primary function ofthe CAC model is value reconciliation among the participants. (Vari, 1995)
	•	The agenda for CAC activities is usually defmed by the problem owners. As a consequence, many important issues may be excluded from the discourse, including the questions of alternative solutions or the social need for the project. The problem owners may select the agenda strategically, so as to support their interests. (Vari, 1995)
	•	CACs are expected to formulate a more-or-Iess consensual position with regard to certain issues with the help of a moderator. (Vari, 1995)
	•	Legitimacy of the CAC model is based on the argument that citizens and interest positions affected by a certain problem are represented by CAC members. (Vari, 1995)
	•	The CAC model provides the general public with the opportunity to attend committee meetings. The chance for the general public to influence the discourse is, however, limited. (Vari, 1995)
	•	CACs are most frequently invited to participate in stages of the decision making process where public interest and values have to be made explicit, for example, in defming evaluation criteria and their relative weights. (Vari, 1995)
	•	CACs are most frequently invited to participate in stages of the decision making process where public interest and values have to be made explicit, for example, in defming evaluation criteria and their relative weights. The CAC context also facilitates the translation of fears, feelings, and concerns into values and norms. (Vari, 1995)
	•	CAC members usually have little chance to make factual judgments, for example, to evaluate the feasibility of alternative solutions, since these activities are usually assumed to be the tasks oftechnical experts. (Vari, 1995)CACs possess little opportunity to define the terms to be applied, because the problems are traditionally conceptualized by the problem owners before public participation gets started. (Vari, 1995)
	•	CACs do have the opportunity to criticize claims and arguments put forth by other parties. (Vari, 1995)
	•	CACs have merely advisory power, problem owners mayor may not take their criticisms and recommendations into consideration. (Vari, 1995)
	•	the primary function of CACs is value reconciliation, discussions are expected to be highly competent with regard to the values, norms, fears, feelings, and concerns of the groups and organizations represented. (Vari, 1995)
	•	In CAC sessions, decision analytical models, including multi-attribute utility models or other multi-criteria structures, are frequently used to provide a framework for the iterative development of a coherent representation ofthe problem. (Vari, 1995)
	•	The CAC model - due to its conciliatory approach to conflict resolution - does not encourage the confrontation of contradictory opinions. (Vari, 1995)
	•	Implementation of the CAC model usually results in more participatory processes and more supportable decisions than negotiation or mediation, but less participatory processes and less supportable decisions than direct methods, especially with regard to local and regional problems. (Vari, 1995)
	•	the CAC model does not provide for communication between committee members and the general public. (Vari, 1995)
	•	The technical feasibility of the CAC model is relatively high, since it does not require any special mechanism nor any substantial funding. (Vari, 1995)
	•	CACs are created and fmanced by private firms or governments. (Vari, 1995)
	•	There has to exist a legal framework or some other incentive which makes industry or government recognize that public participation is ultimately also in their interests. This, however, assumes a relatively high degree of environmental awareness of the affected population and a society where the success of private business and the legitimacy of government is dependent on good public reputation. (Vari, 1995)
	•	CACs are established to represent a variety of public interests in environmental decision processes. (Vari, 1995)
	•	The model can be functional only in a society where these interests are well articulated and the public is relatively well organized. (Vari, 1995)
	•	the CAC model can effectively function only in a political context where the mutual acceptance of multiple perspectives and the cooperation between the various parties is more rewarding than direct political confrontation. (Vari, 1995)
	•	Both the major strengths and weaknesses of the CAC model originate from the relatively small number of participants and the reconciliatory approach taken to conflict resolution. (Vari, 1995)
	•	The small size of CACs makes the use of effective group facilitation and decision support technologies feasible. This can assure that participants extensively discuss and clarify the terms, defmitions, concepts, and data that they use. (Vari, 1995)
	•	Various tools (e.g., decision analytical models) can help to separate factual and value judgments, elicit judgments from CAC members, and translate expressive claims into cognitive or normative ones. (Vari, 1995)
	•	the CAC model is that it allows public participation in a procedural stage where no preliminary decisions have already been taken. Participation does not have to be restricted to the fmal decision, it can also include the defmition of goals and constraints, as well as the generation and evaluation of alternative solutions. (Vari, 1995)
	•	The CAC model also allows - at least in principle - that public participation does not end as soon as the decision is made, it can include participation in the implementation phase (e.g., monitoring) as well. (Vari, 1995)
	•	The major weakness of the CAC model is the lack of representativeness of the participants in cases where a large number of affected groups are involved. (Vari, 1995)

	•	In some cases, the moderator is selected from the members of the CAC, in other cases, he/she is a professional facilitator specialized in group decision or negotiation support. (Vari, 1995)
	•	Typically, moderators are selected by the problem owners, but the methods of facilitation are determined by the moderators. (Vari, 1995)
CAC members
	•	In the majority of cases, CAC members have a very limited opportunity to influence the decisions regarding the moderator and the facilitation method. (Vari, 1995)
Citizen jury
	•	A Citizens Jury is a group of randomly selected people, gathered in such a way as to represent a microcosm of their community, who are paid to attend a series of meetings to learn about and discuss a set of candidates in an election or a specific public policy issue and make public their conclusions. (Crosby, 1995)
	•	A Citizens Jury should be designed and conducted so as to serve the general public and not a special interest. The process works better on value questions than technical issues. (Crosby, 1995)
	•	the ability of any group to make good judgments is strongly affected by the time they have and the size of discussion group. (Crosby, 1995)
	•	There are two essentials in maintaining the integrity of the process: minimization of staff biases and maintenance of effective citizen control. (Crosby, 1995)

Jurors
	•	The jurors are selected at random through a quota system which makes them a microcosm of the community from which they are drawn. Typically, the quotas include demographics such as age, gender, education and race, or else rely on balancing the attitudes of the jurors on the question at hand so that they resemble their community. Sometimes both demographic and attitudinal quotas are used. (Crosby, 1995)
	•	The jurors are paid to attend hearings where they become informed about the topic at hand. (Crosby, 1995)
	•	The information presented to the jurors must come from several points of view and be presented in a way which is fair to the concerned parties. (Crosby, 1995)
	•	The jurors should be given adequate time to deliberate and should have the option of conducting their deliberations in private. (Crosby, 1995)
	•	The jurors must have the opportunity to review and approve all of their fmdings and recommendations. (Crosby, 1995)
	•	The jurors must be given the opportunity to evaluate the process and make public their views at the project's conclusion. This evaluation should include at least one standardized question on the fairness ofthe proceedings so that comparisons with other projects are possible. (Crosby, 1995)
	•	one or more of the jurors should be selected at the end of the hearings to attend an "oversight" meeting with jurors from other projects to review the rules and staff performance. (Crosby, 1995)
Citizen jury process
	•	The Citizens Jury process uses random selection to impanel a group of citizens to study specific public policy issues or to review candidates in an election. (Crosby, 1995)
	•	The main goal of the process is to enable a microcosm of the community to exercise both reason and concern for others to answer the question: "How should we live together?" (Crosby, 1995)
	•	A Citizens Jury process can improve on this situation by insuring that the group o f people gathered to discuss needs are also those who must decide how and where to locate the facility. (Crosby, 1995)
	•	The Citizens Jury process was created to deal with normative problems and it is here that its greatest strength lies. The Citizens Jury process was created on the assumption that there is no intellectual way to create a foundation from which an objective definition of normative concepts like "bias" or "general will" is possible.4 If one wants an answer to whether or not the Citizens Jury process is biased or in tune with the general will, one should not tum to academia, but to the people themselves in a reflective mode. (Crosby, 1995)
	•	The hearing format of the Citizens Jury process means that the jurors are given a good opportunity to check out the truthfulness of claims by the principal participants. (Crosby, 1995)
	•	The Citizens Jury process does a good job of meeting the three fairness and four competency criteria. (Crosby, 1995)
Citizen panels
	•	Citizen panels, sometimes called planning cells, originated in Germany. They have been used since 1972 to give citizens a chance to take part in local planning. Unlike the citizen jury process in which the jurors are actually empowered to make decisions for a certain community, the role of the panellists is to offer advice to policy makers. (Lofstedt, 1999)
	•	Citizen panels are not problem free. (Lofstedt, 1999)
	•	citizen panels can aid in siting noxious facilities if those facilitating are competent and have public credibility. (Lofstedt, 1999)
Citizendium 
	•	Citizendium – a ‘citizens’ compendium of everything’ – aims to use the wiki model but build in expert editors to ensure quality control (Stilgoe et al., 2006)
City
Capital city
	•	Il n'y a que ces villes-là qui deviennent capitales. Ce sont des entonnoirs où viennent aboutir tous les versants géographiques, politiques, moraux, intellectuels d'un pays, toutes les pentes naturelles d'un peuple ; des puits de civilisation, pour ainsi dire, et aussi des égouts, où commerce, industrie, intelligence, population, tout ce qui est sève, tout ce qui est vie, tout ce qui est âme dans une nation, filtre et s'amasse sans cesse goutte à goutte, siècle à siècle. (Hugo and Chamarat, 1998)
Civilization
	•	Les civilisations n'ont été créées et guidées jusqu'ici que par une petite aristocratie intellectuelle, jamais par les foules. Les foules n'ont de puissance que pour détruire. Leur domination représente toujours une phase de barbarie. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Une civilisation implique des règles fixes, une discipline, le passage de l'instinctif au rationnel, la prévoyance de l'avenir, un degré élevé de culture, conditions que les foules, abandonnées à elles-mêmes, se sont toujours montrées absolument incapables de réaliser. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Quand l'édifice d'une civilisation est vermoulu, ce sont toujours les foules qui en amènent l'écroulement. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Le merveilleux et le légendaire sont les vrais supports des civilisations.—L'imagination populaire a toujours été la base de la puissance des hommes d'État. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	chaque civilisation dérive d'un petit nombre d'idées fondamentales fort rarement renouvelées. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	L'âme de la race représente l'état de civilisation et l'âme de la foule l'état de barbarie. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Arrivée à un certain niveau de puissance et de complexité, la civilisation cesse de grandir, et, dès qu'elle ne grandit plus, elle est condamnée à décliner bientôt. (Lebon, 1895)
Civilization decline
	•	Cette heure inévitable est toujours marquée par l'affaiblissement de l'idéal qui soutenait l'âme de la race. À mesure que cet idéal pâlit, tous les édifices religieux, politiques ou sociaux dont il était l'inspirateur commencent à s'ébranler. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Avec l'évanouissement progressif de son idéal, la race perd de plus en plus ce qui faisait sa cohésion, son unité et sa force. L'individu peut croître en personnalité et en intelligence, mais en même temps aussi l'égoïsme collectif de la race est remplacé par un développement excessif de l'égoïsme individuel accompagné par l'affaissement du caractère et par l'amoindrissement de l'aptitude à l'action. Ce qui formait un peuple, une unité, un bloc, finit par devenir une agglomération d'individualités sans cohésion et que maintiennent artificiellement pour quelque temps encore les traditions et les institutions. C'est alors que, divisé par leurs intérêts et leurs aspirations, ne sachant plus se gouverner, les hommes demandent à être dirigés dans leurs moindres actes, et que l'État exerce son influence absorbante. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Avec la perte définitive de l'idéal ancien, la race finit par perdre entièrement son âme; elle n'est plus qu'une poussière d'individus isolés et redevient ce qu'elle était à son point de départ: une foule. Elle en a tous les caractères transitoires sans consistance et sans lendemain. La civilisation n'a plus aucune fixité et est à la merci de tous les hasards. La plèbe est reine et les barbares avancent. La civilisation peut sembler brillante encore parce qu'elle possède la façade extérieure qu'un long passé a créée, mais c'est en réalité un édifice vermoulu que rien ne soutient plus et qui s'effondrera au premier orage. (Lebon, 1895)
Class society
	•	Class societies remain related to the ideal of equality in their developmental dynamic (in its various formulations from ‘equal opportunity’ to the variants of socialist models of society) (Beck, 1992)
	•	[…] the value system of the ‘unequal’ society (Beck, 1992)
	•	[…] the utopia of equality contains a wealth of substantial and positive goals of social change (Beck, 1992)
	•	the dream of class society is that everyone wants and ought to have a share of the pie. (Beck, 1992)
Class struggle
Bourgoisie
	•	The linear schema loses sight of the fact that the bourgeoisie is the only revolutionary class that eyer won; at the same time it is the only class for which the development of the economy was the cause and the con­ sequence of its taking hold of society. (Debord, 2012)
	•	The bourgeoisie developed its autonomous economic power in the medieval period of the weakening of the State, at the moment of feudal fragmentation of balanced powers. But the modern State which, through Mercantilism, began to support the development of the bourgeoisie, and which finally""became its State at the time of Iaisser faire, laisser passer, was to re­veal later that it was endowed with a central power in the calculated management of the economic process. (Debord, 2012)
	•	the bourgeois revolution is over; the proletarian revolution is a project born on the foundation of the preceding revolution but differing from it qualitatively. (Debord, 2012)
	•	The bourgeoisie came to power because it is the class of the developing economy. (Debord, 2012)
Proletariat
	•	the bourgeois revolution is over; the proletarian revolution is a project born on the foundation of the preceding revolution but differing from it qualitatively. (Debord, 2012)
	•	The proletariat cannot itself be the power except by becoming the class of consciousness. (Debord, 2012)
Totalitarian-ideological class
	•	The totalitarian-ideological class in power is the power of an over­turned world: the stronger it is, the more it claims not to exist, and its force serves above all to affirm its inexistence. (Debord, 2012)
Climate change policy
	•	Climate change is a vivid case in point; it is a highly complex policy issue involving multiple causal factors and high levels of disagreement about the nature of the problem and the best way to tackle it. (Coker, 2009)
Climate modelling
	•	Climate modelling differs fundamentally from weather forecasting. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
	•	Looking at just one run of a climate model carries the same dangers as looking at just one forecast for Burns’ Day in 1990, although the repercussions of such naïve over-confidence would be much greater in the climate case. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
Closed-ended knowledge tests
	•	Closed-ended knowledge tests (e.g., multiple-choice, true—false tests) are relatively cheap to administer, but they are also particularly vulnerable to several potential design flaws: (a) reactivity—changing people's beliefs through the cues offered by questions or answer options; (b) illusory expertise—restricting the expression of nonexpert beliefs; and (c) illusory dicscrimination—suppressing (or at least not allowing) the expression of inconsistent beliefs. (Bostrom et al., 1994)
Code
	•	Codes, by definition, must carry information. (Brown, 2018)
	•	Codes do not occur naturally in the world. (Brown, 2018)
	•	Codes are the deliberate inventions of intelligence consciousnesses. (Brown, 2018)
	•	Codes don’t appear organically; they must be created. (Brown, 2018)
Genetetic code
	•	The genetic code obviously carried data – specific instructions on how to build organism. (Brown, 2018)
Collective representation
	•	ces représentations collectives sont, par nature, différentes des représentations individuelles. (Mannoni, 1985)
Commissionner
	•	un commissaire ceint de son écharpe n'est plus un homme, c'est la statue de la loi, froide, sourde, muette. (Dumas, 1998)
Communication
	•	Communication often begins before a word is said. (Fischhoff, 1995)
	•	Communications should tell people things that they need to know. Doing so requires thinking, in detail, about recipients’ circumstances. That is a natural part of everyday conversations with specific individuals. It be- comes much more difficult with distant and diverse audiences. (Fischhoff, 1995)
	•	Communications can be crafted to fill gaps, reinforce correct beliefs, and correct misconceptions with some assurance that the messages are to the point and can be comprehended by recipients. (Fischhoff, 1995)
	•	The coinage of good communication is trust in the message source ("Will you believe me when I tell you something?"), and this is the underpinning for credibility, which is a perception of the intrinsic honesty of the whole process. (Leiss, 1996)
	•	Communication research has focused on the processes, antecedents, and consequences of news media in a broad range of societal systems. (Kleinnijenhuis et al., 2015)
	•	Unless communications avoid repeating facts that go without saying, they can test their audience’s patience and lose its trust (“Why do they keep saying that? Don’t they think that I know anything?”). (Fischhoff, 2013)
	•	Whatever its content, a communication has little value unless it reaches its audience, either directly (e.g., through warning labels, financial disclosures, or texted alerts) or indirectly (e.g., through friends, physicians, or journalists). (Fischhoff, 2013)
	•	Communications are adequate if they reach people with the in- formation that they need in a form that they can use. (Fischhoff, 2013)
	•	Communication presumes mutual understanding (Sjoberg et al., 2000). (Sjöberg, 2008)
Communication advisor
	•	Tout se résume, pour les media, et quel que soit pratiquement le sujet traité (politique, science, technique, social), à monter un spectacle, avec tout ce que cela suppose de mise en scène, de dramatisation, de rebondissements, de suspens, de jeu de silhouettes familières ou, au contraire, surprenantes. Les media c'es le théâtre sans le théâtre. Et lorsque S. Moscovici (op. cit., p. 281) nous dit que « l’art du gouvernement n’est plus un art de la séduction, mais un art (une science ?) de la communication », on peut se demander s'il ne profère pas un magistral pléonasme. Aucun candidat moderne à une magistrature ou à un pouvoir ne saurait se passer, en effet, d'un conseiller en matière de communication. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Quant au contenu des discours politiques, leur analyse, comme le montre bien celle de R. Ghiglione et de ses collaborateurs (1989, p. 30 sq.), révèle la « restauration de la de la rhétorique (pour ne pas dire la sophistique). (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Et même si l’on peut dire aujourd’hui que le médiatique prime le politique, il convient de rajouter que l’un comme l’autre sont assujettis à l’impératif catégorique du spectaculaire : plaire. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	L’objectif reste la recherche systématique de l’impact qui assure aux media la fidélité de leur public. (Mannoni, 1985)
Mass communication
	•	les moyens de communication de masse, en particulier audiovisuels, créeraient un « monde de mythes » si différent du monde réel que l’appréhension et le jugement humains seraient faussés. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	la presse mais surtout la radio et la télévision « pratiquent (...) l’hypnose sur une grande échelle. (Mannoni, 1985)
Poor communication
	•	Poor communications cause immediate damage if they keep people from using available science knowledge. They cause lasting damage if they erode trust between scientists and the public. That happens when lay people see scientists as insensitive to their needs and scientists see lay people as incapable of grasping seemingly basic facts (2, 9, 24, 50). Such mistrust is fed by the natural tendency to attribute others’ behavior to their essential properties rather than to their circumstances (59). (Fischhoff, 2013)
	•	a communication that does not achieve its desired outcome is not only a waste of time and money, it also represents the loss of an opportunity to have done something that would have worked. (Downs, 2014)
Persuasive communication
	•	statements about risk situations ought to be regarded as acts of persuasive communication, that is, as messages in- tended to persuade a listener of the correctness of a point of view.
	•	Guidance for this new approach was found in the history of twentieth-century marketing communications, which had demonstrated—first in commercial advertising, then more broadly— the effectiveness of a strategy that takes into account two key factors: the characteristics of the audience itself, and the intrinsic legitimacy of the audience's perception of the situation. (Leiss, 1996)
	•	The paradigm of persuasion in the marketing communication approach had identified a broad range of techniques for enhancing trust and credibility for messages. (Leiss, 1996)
	•	In the more prosaic world of risk issues, therefore, emotive techniques of effective persuasive communication—that is, techniques for convincing that audience that a particular person is a credible spokesman on risk issues—could take precedence over the informational content of the risk message itself. (Leiss, 1996)
	•	key ingredient of successful persuasive communication—trust—cannot be manufactured by the use of techniques alone, no matter how artful the practitioners are. A working hypothesis is that trust in institutional risk actors (governments and industry) can ac- cumulate, slowly, through the commitments by those institutions—as demonstrated by deeds, not words— to carry out responsible risk communication and, furthermore, to do so consistently, as a matter of daily practice over the long term, not just in response to crisis events. (Leiss, 1996)
Prestigious communication source
	•	a prestigious communication source can (at least in the short run) compensate for trivial factual messages. (Kasperson et al., 1988)

Delayed treatment design 
	•	a “delayed treatment” design, where half of the participants are randomly designated to receive the communi- cation immediately and the other half to get it at a future time. Behaviors of the two groups can be compared after the former has received the communication but before the latter has. Out- come measures might be further simplified to focus on knowl- edge, understanding, and intentions, all of which can be collected in a single session with the communication, to avoid the need for longitudinal data collection. (Downs, 2014)

Non-verbal communication
	•	Making his patients completely comfortable, he would detect signs of hidden tension and unmet desires that came through in their face, voice, and posture. (Greene, 2018)
	•	In his office, he placed his desk at the far end of the room, making his patients walk toward him. He would notice changes in the walk from before to after the session. He would scrutinize their way of sitting down, the level of tension in their hands as they grasped the arms of the chair, the degree to which they would face him as they talked, and in a matter of a few seconds, without words being exchanged, he had a profound read on their insecurities and rigidities, as mapped clearly in their body language. (Greene, 2018)
	•	One category that fascinated him was the difference in nonverbal communication between men and women and how this reflected a different way of thinking. He was particularly sensitive to the mannerisms of women. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Over the years, his observation powers extended to elements of nonverbal communication that were nearly imperceptible. (Greene, 2018)
	•	To patients and friends it seemed as if Erickson possessed psychic powers, but they were simply unaware of how long and hard he had studied this, gaining mastery of the second language. (Greene, 2018)
	•	For Milton Erickson, his sudden paralysis opened his eyes to not only a different form of communication but also a completely different way of relating to people. (Greene, 2018)
	•	nonverbal communication cannot be experienced simply through thinking and translating thoughts into words but must be felt physically as one engages with the facial expressions or locked positions of other people. It is a different form of knowledge, one that connects with the animal part of our nature and involves our mirror neurons. (Greene, 2018)
	•	As Erickson progressed in this Self-transformation, he noticed that most people go in the opposite direction—becoming more Self-absorbed and unobservant with each passing year. (Greene, 2018)
	•	As Erickson saw it, the harshness of life makes most people turn inward. They have no mental space left over for simple observations, and the second language largely passes them by. (Greene, 2018)
	•	It is estimated that over 65 percent of all human communication is nonverbal but that people pick up and internalize only about 5 percent of this information. Instead, almost all of our social attention is absorbed by what people say, which more often than not actually serves to conceal what they are really thinking and feeling. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Nonverbal cues tell us what people are trying to emphasize with their words and the subtext of their message, the nuances of communication. These cues tell us what they are actively hiding, their real desires. They reflect in an immediate way people’s emotions and moods. To miss this information is to operate blindly, to invite misunderstanding, and to lose endless opportunities to influence people by not noticing the signs of what they really want or need. (Greene, 2018)
	•	It requires opening up your senses and relating to people more on the physical level, absorbing their physical energy and not just their words. You do not simply observe their facial expression, but you register it from within, so that the impression stays with you and communicates. As you gain greater vocabulary in this language, you will be able to correlate a gesture with a possible emotion. (Greene, 2018)
	•	As your sensitivity increases, you will begin to notice more and more of what you have been missing. And equally important, you will discover a new and deeper way of relating to people, with the increased social powers this will bring you. (Greene, 2018)
	•	We are the most successful social animal on the planet. For hundreds of thousands of years our hunter-gatherer ancestors could survive only by constantly communicating with one another through non-verbal cues. Developed over so much time, before the invention of language, that is how the human face became so expressive, and gestures so elaborate. This is bred deep within us. We have a continual desire to communicate our feelings and yet at the same time the need to conceal them for proper social functioning. With these counterforces battling inside us, we cannot completely control what we communicate. Our real feelings continually leak out in the form of gestures, tones of voice, facial expressions, and posture. We are not trained, however, to pay attention to people’s nonverbal cues. By sheer habit, we fixate on the words people say, while also thinking about what we’ll say next. What this means is that we are using only a small percentage of the potential social skills we all possess. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Imagine, for instance, conversations with people you’ve recently met. By paying extra-close attention to the nonverbal cues they emit, you can pick up their moods and mirror these moods back to them, getting them to unconsciously relax in your presence. As the conversation progresses, you can pick up signs that they are responding to your gestures and mirroring, which gives you license to go further and deepen the spell. In this way, you can build up rapport and win over a valuable ally. Conversely, imagine people who almost immediately reveal signs of hostility toward you. You are able to see through their fake, tight smiles, to pick up the flashes of irritation that cross their face and the signs of subtle discomfort in your presence. Registering all this as it happens, you can then politely disengage from the interaction and remain wary of them, looking for further signs of hostile intentions. You have probably saved yourself from an unnecessary battle or an ugly act of sabotage. (Greene, 2018)
	•	there are three aspects to this particular law: understanding how to observe people; learning some basic keys for decoding nonverbal communication; and mastering the art of what is known as impression management, playing your role to maximum effect. (Greene, 2018)
	•	give yourself the goal of observing one or two facial expressions that seem to go against what the person is saying or indicate some additional information. Be attentive to microexpressions, quick flashes on the face of tension, or forced smiles. (Greene, 2018)
	•	your observing of people must never be obvious. Feeling scrutinized, people will freeze up and try to control their expressions. Too much direct eye contact will betray you. You must appear natural and attentive, using only quick peripheral glances to notice any changes in the face, voice, or body. (Greene, 2018)
	•	In observing any particular individual over time, you need to establish their baseline expression and mood. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Some people are naturally quiet and reserved, their facial expression revealing this. Some are more animated and energetic, while still others continually wear an anxious look. Aware of a person’s usual demeanor, you can pay greater attention to any deviations—for instance, sudden animation in someone who is generally reserved, or a relaxed look from the habitually nervous. (Greene, 2018)
	•	 Once you know a person’s baseline, it will be much easier to see signs of dissimulation or distress in them. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Related to the baseline expression, try to observe the same person in different settings, noticing how their nonverbal cues change if they are talking to a spouse, a boss, an employee. (Greene, 2018)
	•	observe people who are about to do something exciting—a trip to some alluring place, a date with someone they’ve been pursuing, or any event for which they have high expectations. Note the looks of anticipation, how the eyes open wider and stay there, the face flushed and generally animated, a slight smile on the lips as they think of what’s about to come. Contrast this with the tension exhibited by a person about to take a test or go on a job interview. You are increasing your vocabulary when it comes to correlating emotions and facial expressions. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Pay great attention to any mixed signals you pick up: a person professes to love your idea, but their face shows tension and their tone of voice is strained; or they congratulate you on your promotion, but the smile is forced and the expression seems sad. Such mixed signals are very common. They can also involve different parts of the body. (Greene, 2018)
	•	With mixed signals, you need to be aware that a greater part of nonverbal communication involves the leakage of negative emotions, and you need to give greater weight to the negative cue as indicative of the person’s true feelings. At some point, you can then ask yourself why they might feel sadness or antipathy. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Remember that everything people do is a sign of some sort; there is no such thing as a gesture that does not communicate. (Greene, 2018)
	•	You will pay attention to people’s silences, the clothes they wear, the arrangement of objects on their desk, their breathing patterns, the tension in certain muscles (particularly in the neck), the subtext in their conversations—what is not said or what is implied. All of these discoveries should excite and impel you to go further. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Words express direct information. We can argue about what people mean when they say something, but the interpretations are fairly limited. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Non-verbal cues are much more ambiguous and indirect. There is no dictionary to tell you what this or that means. It depends on the individual and the context. If you are not careful, you will glean signs but quickly interpret them to fit your own emotional biases about people, which will make your observations not only useless but also dangerous. If you are observing someone you naturally dislike, or who reminds you of someone unpleasant in your past, you will tend to see almost any cue as unfriendly or hostile. You will do the opposite for people you like. In these exercises you must strive to subtract your personal preferences and prejudices about people. Related to this is what is known as Othello’s error. (Greene, 2018)
	•	In the play Othello by Shakespeare, the main character, Othello, assumes that his wife, Desdemona, is guilty of adultery based on her nervous response when questioned about some evidence. In truth Desdemona is innocent, but the aggressive, paranoid nature of Othello and his intimidating questions make her nervous, which he interprets as a sign of guilt. What happens in such cases is that we pick up certain emotional cues from the other person—nervousness, for instance—and we assume they come from a certain source. We rush to the first explanation that fits what we want to see. But the nervousness could have several explanations, could be a temporary reaction to our questioning or the overall circumstances. The error is not in the observing but in the decoding. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Becoming acutely aware of your own nonverbal behavior will make you more sensitive and alert to the signals of others. You will be better able to imagine the emotions that go with the cue. And you will also gain greater control of your nonverbal behavior, something very valuable for playing the right social role. (Greene, 2018)
	•	in developing these observational skills you will notice a physical change in yourself and in your relation to people. You will become increasingly sensitive to people’s shifting moods and even anticipate them as you feel inside something of what they’re feeling. Taken far enough, such powers can make you seem almost psychic, as they did with Milton Erickson. (Greene, 2018)
	•	People give out clear indications in their body language of active dislike or hostility. These include the sudden squinting of the eyes at something you have said, the glare, the pursing of the lips until they nearly disappear, the stiff neck, the torso or feet that turn away from you while you are still engaged in a conversation, the folding of the arms as you try to make a point, and an overall tenseness in the body. The problem is that you will not usually see such signs unless a person’s displeasure has become too strong to conceal at all. Instead, you must train yourself to look for the microexpressions and the other more subtle signs that people give out. (Greene, 2018)
	•	An excellent gauge for decoding antagonism is to compare people’s body language toward you and toward others. (Greene, 2018)
	•	monitoring nonverbal cues is essential in your attempts at influencing and seducing people. It is the best way to gauge the degree to which a person is falling under your spell. When people start to feel comfortable in your presence, they will stand closer to you or lean in, their arms not folded or revealing any tension. (Greene, 2018)
	•	signs of dominance or weakness are more often expressed in nonverbal communication. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Keep in mind that the feeling of being in a superior social position gives people a confidence that will radiate outward in their body language. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Confidence usually comes with a greater feeling of relaxation that is clearly reflected in the face, and with a greater freedom of movement. Those who are powerful will feel allowed to look around more at others, choosing to make eye contact with whomever they please. Their eyelids are more closed, a sign of seriousness and competence. If they feel bored or annoyed, they show it more freely and openly. They often smile less, frequent smiling being a sign of overall insecurity. They feel more entitled to touch people, such as with friendly pats on the back or on the arm. In a meeting, they will tend to take up more space and create more distance around themselves. They stand taller, and their gestures are relaxed and comfortable. Most important, others feel compelled to imitate their style and mannerisms. The leader will tend to impose a form of nonverbal communication on the group in very subtle ways. You will notice people mimicking not only their ideas but also their calm or more frenetic energy. (Greene, 2018)
	•	In certain settings, when people want to get a fix on who we are, they pay greater attention to the nonverbal cues we emit. This could be in a job interview, a group meeting, or a public appearance. Aware of this, smart social performers will know how to control these cues to some degree and consciously emit the signs that are suitable and positive. They know how to seem likable, flash genuine smiles, use welcoming body language, and mirror the people they deal with. They know the dominance cues and how to radiate confidence. They know that certain looks are more expressive than words in conveying disdain or attraction. In general, you want to be aware of your nonverbal style so you can consciously alter certain aspects for better effect. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Keep in mind that your expectations about people are communicated to them nonverbally. (Greene, 2018)
	•	We humans are masters at smelling the difference. We can almost feel it with people in their nonverbal behavior—the relaxed or tense body language, the flowing or halting tone of voice; the way the eyes gaze and let you in; the genuine smile or lack of it. (Greene, 2018)
Communication network
Informal communication networks
	•	Informal communication networks involve the linkages that exist among friends, neighbors, and co-workers, and within social groups more generally. (Kasperson et al., 1988)
	•	ince one's friends or co-workers provide reference points f o r validating perceptions but are also likely to share a more general cultural view or bias, the potential exists for both amplifying and attenuating information. (Kasperson et al., 1988)
	•	interpersonal networks will lead to divergent risk perceptions, management preferences, and levels of concern. (Kasperson et al., 1988)  
Complacency
	•	Second, complacency would be a dangerous evolutionary trait for a conscious animal such as humans. If our early ancestors had been prone to feeling content with present circumstances, they would not have been sensitive enough to possible dangers that lurked in the most apparently safe environments. We survived and thrived through our continual conscious alertness, which predisposed us to thinking and imagining the possible negative in any circumstance. We no longer live in savannas or forests teeming with life-threatening predators and natural dangers, but our brains are wired as if we were. We are inclined therefore toward a continual negative bias, which often consciously is expressed through complaining and griping. (Greene, 2018)
Concept
	•	Now we come to a second principle of Hegel's cosmology. The motion of concepts is not merely a motion of the intellect, which, startingthe analysis with certain determinations, moves away from them andposits their negation. It is an objective development as well, and it iscaused by the fact that every finite (well-determined, limited) object,process, state; etc., has the tendency to emphasize the elements of theother objects present in it, and to become what it is not. The object,"being restless within its own limit," 79 "strives not to be what it is" (Feyerabend, 1993)
	•	the content of a concept is determined also by the way in which it is related to perception. (Feyerabend, 1993)
Elusive concept 
	•	This verbal formulation is easy, but the mathematical translation of the concept is elusive, such that a definitive commynity detection method has not yet been found. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
Mathematical concept
	•	This verbal formulation is easy, but the mathematical translation of the concept is elusive, such that a definitive commynity detection method has not yet been found. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
Methaporical concept
	•	This verbal formulation is easy, but the mathematical translation of the concept is elusive, such that a definitive commynity detection method has not yet been found. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012) 
Conflict
	•	Conflict between an automatic reaction and an intention to control it is common in our lives. (Kahneman, 2012)
Conflict resolution
	•	There are three basic approaches to conflict resolution: (i) the statistical approach - aimed at fmding a solution on the basis ofthe statistical analysis of opinions, (ii) the reconciliatory approach - aimed at finding, in an interactive group setting, a mutually acceptable solution without trying to address all disagreements, and (iii) the confrontational approach - aimed at fmding a creative solution via direct confrontation ofthe different opinions (Vari 1989). (Vari, 1995)
Conformity
	•	Conformity is not always a bad thing: the fact that several conscientious and intelligent people believe something is a valid reason for us to take it seriously. (Omand, 2014)
Conformism
	•	aspects coercitifs des pratiques collectives. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	L’un des modes majeurs du contrôle social est probablement le conformisme. Il s’agit d’un processus psychologique poussant les individus à se plier à la norme socialement définie. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	effets de la situation de groupe. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	modification du jugement personnel par le groupe. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	odalités de la soumission à la norme. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	force de la pression exercée par le groupe du simple fait de sa présence.
	•	vivre en société, c’est mettre concrètement en relation l’expérience publique et l’expérience privée ». (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	détermination culturelle des valeurs : c’est l’appartenance au groupe qui fixe les croyances et leurs limites. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	« le besoin d’approbation sociale, la crainte de la sanction agiraient en fond motivationnel » et expliqueraient également le conformisme. En effet, c’est peut-être bien, en fin de compte, en termes d’affectivité qu’il convient de poser ce problème. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	la pression à la conformité peut être éclairée encore par le mécanisme de l’identification. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Relevons encore le phénomène de mimétisme auquel se réfèrent les biologistes du comportement (éthologues) suivant lesquels de nombreuses espèces animales ont des formes copiant les éléments du milieu. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Les efforts d’assimilation que font, par exemple, l’étranger ou l’immigrant vis-à-vis de leur culture d’accueil est tout à fait significatif : en adoptant les tournures linguistiques et les coutumes de ses hôtes, celui-ci se défend contre sa crainte d’être rejeté. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Le groupe tend donc à s’organiser spontanément dans le sens de l’accord des esprits et des attitudes. (Mannoni, 1985)
Contextual activities
	•	Contextual activities are important because they contribute to organizational effectiveness  in  ways  that shape the  organizational, social, and  psychological context that  serves as the catalyst for  task activities and processes. (Borman and Motowidlo, 1997)
	•	Contextual activities include volunteering to carry out task activities that are not formally part of the job and helping and cooperating with others in the organization to get tasks accomplished. (Borman and Motowidlo, 1997)
Control
Symbolic control
	•	But when functional, operational control is outside their reach, organizations and experts must try to establish symbolic control of the problem. They create a set of symbols that signify that they do in fact command expert knowledge and organizational competence. These symbols then become tools that organizations can use to satisfy environmental demands, legitimate their actions, and fend off intrusive political pressures. Organizations and experts control the uncontrollable by creating apparent affinities, which are then folded into fantasy documents. Those documents, when wielded successfully as rhetorical devices, allow organizations to continue functioning without high levelsof outside oversight. Another way to think of this is that risks are de- fined, effective risk managers are created, and risk acceptability is established. All of this is very much a social construction, and organiza- tions are the main constructors. (Clarke, 1999)
Controversy
	•	Controversy today also reflect the scale of science and its pervasive influence on contemporary life (Nelkin, 1992)
Country risk ratings
	•	Country risk ratings always contain elements of judgment of a government’s actions, its policies and eventually its creditworthiness. (Sottilotta, 2016)
Conscience
	•	The brain is full of networks where various web-like structures provide the integration between specialized areas. In the cerebellum, neurons form modules that are repeated again and again: the interaction between modules is restricted to neighbours, similarly to what happens in a lattice. In other areas of the brain, we find random connections, with a more or less equal probability of connecting local, intermediate, or distant neurons. Finally, the neocortex—the region involved in many of the higher functions of mammals—combines local structures with more random, long-range connections. Some scientists think that these wiring schemes may be responsible for subjective awareness: the emerging conscience may be the result of a sufficiently complex network structure. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
Conspiracy
	•	Une conspiration peut abattre un tyran, mais que peut-elle sur une croyance bien établie? (Lebon, 1895)
Couple
Contrasexual couple
	•	There are infinite variations on these patterns, because everyone has very particular circumstances and mixes of the masculine and feminine. For instance, there are men who are more psychologically feminine than women and women who are more psychologically masculine than men. If they are heterosexual, the man will be drawn to masculine women who have the qualities he never developed in himself. He has more of an animus than an anima. The woman will be drawn to feminine men. There are many such contrasexual couples, some more overt than others, and they can be successful if both sides get what they want—a famous historical example would be the composer Frédéric Chopin and the writer George Sand, Sand being more like the husband and Chopin like the wife. If they are homosexual, the man or woman will still be in search of the contrasexual qualities undeveloped from within. In general, people are imbalanced, overidentifying with the masculine or feminine and drawn to the polar opposite. (Greene, 2018)
Conspiracy theory
	•	The tendency to reason according to similarity of cause and effect is frequently found in conjunction with the previously noted bias toward inferring centralized direction. Together, they explain the persuasiveness of conspiracy theories. Such theories are invoked to explain large effects for which there do not otherwise appear to be correspondingly large causes. For example, it seems “. . .outrageous that a single, pathetic, weak figure like Lee Harvey Oswald should alter world history.”117 Because the purported motive for the assassination of John Kennedy is so dissimilar from the effect it is alleged to explain, in the minds of many it fails to meet the criterion of a coherent narrative explanation. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	If such “little” causes as mistakes, accidents, or the aberrant behavior of a single indi- vidual have big effects, then the implication follows that major events happen for reasons that are senseless and random rather than by purpose-ul direction. (Heuer, 1999)
Cost-Benefit Analysis
	•	CBA has been seen as a tool to increase the quality of regulation and public policy through welfare economics principles and Pareto efficiency. (Torritia and Ikpeb, 2014:1)
	•	CBA in theory allows for the improvement of social and environmental conditions based on empirical evidence (Sunstein, 2002; Koopmans et al, 1964) whilst improving market competitiveness (Viscusi et al, 1987) (Torritia and Ikpeb, 2014:1)
	•	CBA is often used by public administrations as an instrument to measure only certain components of private costs (Torriti and Ikpeb, 2014)
	•	CBA practice suggests that benefits are more problematic to quantify and monetize than costs (Torriti and Ikpeb, 2014:3)
	•	CBA is the most comprehensive of a family of economic evaluation techniques that seek to monetise the costs and/or benefits of proposals (Torritia and Ikpeb, 2014:5)
	•	CBA is based on the Kaldor–Hicks efficiency criterion. The benefits should be enough that those that benefit could in theory compensate those that loose out. It is justifiable for society as a whole to make some worse off if this means a greater gain for others (Torriti and Ikpeb, 2014)
	•	CBA is a tool for judging efficiency in the case where the public sector supply goods, or where the policies executed by the public sectors influence the behavior of private sectors and change the allocation of resources (Stiglitz, 2000) (Torriti and Ikpeb, 2014)
	•	CBA can still be employed in order to identify how losers from e.g. displacement will be economically affected by the change (Torriti and Ikpeb, 2014)
	•	Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) is an economic technique applied to public decision- making that attempts to quantify and compare the economic advantages (benefits) and disadvantages (costs) associated with a particular project or policy for society as a whole (Torriti and Ikpeb, 2014)
	•	Cost-benefit analysis emphasizes the first (absolute rationality) (Perrow, 1999)
	•	Cost-benefit analysis (CBA) involves enumerating all tangible and intangible societal costs and benefits associated with a particular decision or option and these are valued in a common unit, which is typically monetary (Stokcy and Zeckhauser, 1978; Weinstein and Fineherg, 1980: Layard and Glaister. 1994: Tietenberg. 1996). (Williams and Paustenbach, 2002)
	•	CBAs have greater flexibility in that they allow for comparisons across diverse programs that may have different health outcomes (Williams and Paustenbach, 2002)
	•	only CBAs can lead to efficient (socially optimal) policy choices. (Williams and Paustenbach, 2002)
	•	cost-benefit balancing is accomplished only through heroic modeling assumptions that obscure the underlying uncertainties and value choices.' (Sachs, 2011)
	•	Cost-benefit analysis also deals awkwardly with equity concerns, including inter-generational equity. (Sachs, 2011)
	•	cost-benefit analysis "proceeds awkwardly in the absence of fully characterized risks" and involves questionable monetization of environmental and health harms. (Sachs, 2011)
	•	CBA is often a useful tool for judging the balance between the benefits of each option and the costs incurred in implementing it. (Great Britain and Health and Safety Executive, 2001)
	•	CBA aims to express all relevant costs and benefits in a common currency, usually money. This in principle requires the explicit valuation of the benefit of reducing the risk. (Great Britain and Health and Safety Executive, 2001)
	•	cost benefit analysis (CBA) offers a framework, widely used in Government, for comparing the benefits of reducing risks against the costs incurred for a particular option for managing risks. (Great Britain and Health and Safety Executive, 2001)
	•	In practice, a CBA cannot be done without the adoption of certain technical conventions. (Great Britain and Health and Safety Executive, 2001)
	•	When preparing formal CBAs, it is customary to discount future costs and benefits to reflect the fact that people, on balance, prefer to have benefits now and pay for them later. (Great Britain and Health and Safety Executive, 2001)
	•	The benefits to be considered are first those associated with the putative reduction in harm to individuals arising from the increased control of risk: in other words the injury and ill-health averted. But benefits may also accrue to the wider community. These may concern putative reduction in tangible harm, such as property damage, or a reduction in the harm to the social fabric caused by a loss of public trust in the regulatory system, and in the duty-holders creating and controlling the risk, should the risk materialize. (Bandle, 2007)
	•	The costs are those necessarily incurred as a result of instituting the increased risk control, offset by any cost savings which arise, such as the puta- tive loss of production prevented by the reduction in risk and the actual productivity gains which can be achieved by increased control (for example, automating a process can make it more efficient as well as safer). (Bandle, 2007)
	•	Conventional cost–benefit analysis usually requires benefits to exceed costs before a measure can be adopted but, as mentioned above, in the field of occupational health and safety the courts have introduced the bias on the side of health and safety of requiring that duty-holders should adopt a ‘practicable’ control measure unless they can show that the cost of so doing is grossly disproportionate to the benefit achieved. (Bandle, 2007)
	•	Benefit-cost analysis, which attempts to quantify and assign dollar values tothe benefits of different approaches as well as costs (Dudley and Brito 2012). (Dudley, 2014)
	•	Some domains, notably road safety, are dominated b a ‘cost-benefit-analysis culture’ in which the costs of additional safety measures are weighed against probable benefits using explicit value-of-life calculations (Evans 1994). (Hood et al., 2001)
	•	Cost estimates and cost-benefit analysis are key to selecting effective and reasonable security measures. Once the proposed recommendations have been selected, risk is recalculated to determine whether the risk has been reduced to an acceptable or tolerable level. Remember, no organization is without risk.  (Vellani, 2007)
Cost-effectiveness analysis
	•	Cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA), in which the benefits of a program are expressed as some unit of output or outcome. such as "number of cases detected- or "number of lives saved- (Weinstein and Fineberg, 1980: Gold et al., 1996: Tietenberg, 1996). (Williams and Paustenbach, 2002)
	•	Cost-effectiveness analysis, which compares the costs of different approaches against a metric such as years life of saved or tons of a pollutant removed, (Dudley, 2014)
	•	Cost effectiveness is a key component in selecting the best one for the protection of assets. (Vellani, 2007)
Creativity
	•	The old view that creativity is something one is born with, and that it cannot be taught or developed, is largely untrue. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Creativity, in the sense of new and useful ideas, is at least as important in intelligence analysis as in any other human endeavor. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Thinking in terms of analogies and metaphors can be extremely helpful to the creative process. (Greene, 2014)
	•	Consider thinking as an extended form of vision that allows us to see more of the world, and creativity as the ability to expand that vision beyond conventional boundaries. (Greene, 2014)
	•	Creative people are those who have the capacity to resist this shorthand. They can look at a phenomenon from several different angles, noticing something we miss because we only look straight on. Whether such powers are natural or learned does not matter: the mind can be trained to loosen itself up and move outside the grooves. (Greene, 2014)
	•	Creativity is by its nature an act of boldness and rebellion. You are not accepting the status quo or conventional wisdom. You are playing with the very rules you have learned, experimenting and testing the boundaries. (Greene, 2014)
	•	the greatest impediment to creativity is your impatience, the almost inevitable desire to hurry up the process, express something, and make a splash. What happens in such a case is that you do not master the basics; you have no real vocabulary at your disposal. What you mistake for being creative and distinctive is more likely an imitation of other people’s style, or personal rangings that do not really express anything. (Greene, 2014)
	•	In arts, someone establishes a style that is new and vibrant, speaking to the particular spirit of the times. It has an edge because it is so different. Soon imitators pop up everywhere It becomes a fasion, something to coform to, even if the conformity appears to be rebellious and edgy. This can drag on for ten, twenty years; it eventually becomes a cliché, pure style without any real emotion or need. Nothing in culture escapes this deadening dynamics. (Greene, 2014)
	•	We may not be aware of it, but we suffer from the dead forms and conventions that clutter our culture. This problem, however, sets up a tremendous opportunity for creative type. (Greene, 2014)
	•	We imagine that creative people have an interesting idea, which they ten proceed to elaborate and refine in a somewhat linear process. The truth, however, is much messier and more complex. Creativity actually resembles a process known in nature as evolutionary hijacking. In evolution, accidents and contingencies play an enormous role. (Greene, 2014)
	•	What constitutes true creativity is the openness and adaptability of our spirit. When we see or experience something we must be able to look at it from several angles, to see other possibilities beyond the obvious ones. We imagine that the objects around us can be used and co-opted for different purposes. (Greene, 2014)
	•	Creativity and adaptability are inseparable. (Greene, 2014)
	•	Those who think in dualities – believing that there is such a thing as “real” and such a thing as “unreal,” and that they are distinct entities that can never become blended into a third, alchemical element – are creatively limited, and their work can quickly become dead and predicateble. (Greene, 2014)
	•	To maintain a dualistic approach to life requires that we repress many observable truths, but in our unconscious and in our dreams we often let go of the need to create categories for everything, and are able to mix seemingly disparate and contradictory ideas and feelings together with ease. (Greene, 2014)

Human creativity 
	•	Perhaps the greatest impediment to human creativity is the natural decay that sets in over time in any kind of medium or profession. (Greene, 2014)
	•	Human creativity generally follow a similar path, perhaps indicating a kind of organic fatality to the creation of anything. Ideas do not come to us out of nowhere. Instead, we come upon something by accident – for instance a pieace of information overheard in a conversation or an ad on the radio. If we are experienced enough and the moment is ripe, this accidental encounter will spark some interesting associations and idead in us. In looking at the particular materials we can work with, we suddenly see another way to use them. All along the way, contingencies pop up that reveal different paths we can take, and if they are promising ,we follow them, not sure of where they will lead. (Greene, 2014)
Creative Dynamic
	•	This is The Primary Law of the Creative Dynamic that you must engrave deeply in your mind and never forget: your emotional commitment to what you are doing will be translated directly into your work. (Greene, 2014)
Creative endeavour 
	•	When it comes to creative endeaors, time is always relative. (Greene, 2014)
Creative thinkers
	•	Creative thinkers have employed them successfully for centuries. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Your task as a creative thinker is to actively explore the unconscious and contradictory parts of your personality, and examine similar contradictions and tensions in the world at large. Expressing theses tensions within your work in any medium will create a powerfull effect on others, making them sense unconscious truths or feelings that have been obscured or repressed. You look at society at large and the various contradictions that are rampant – for instance, the way in which a culture that espouses the ideal of free expression is charged with an oppressive code of political correctness that tamps free expression down. In science, you look for ideas that go against the existing paradigm, or that seem inexplicable because they are so contradictory. All of these contradictions contain a rich mine of information about a reality that is deeper and more complex than the one immediately perceived. By delving into the chaotic and fluid zone below the level of consciousness where opposites meet, you will be surprised at the exciting and fertile ideas that will come bubbling up to the surface. (Greene, 2014)
Creative people
	•	Creative people do not simply think in words, but use all of their senses, their entire bodies in the process. They find sense cues that stimulate their thoughts on many levels—whether it be the smell of something strong, or the tactile feel of a rubber ball. What this means is that they are more open to alternative ways of thinking, creating, and sensing the world. They allow themselves a broader range of sense experience. (Greene, 2014)
Creative power
	•	This seems obvious to us now, but such an organic way of thinking has great application to our psychological health as well. Now more than ever people focus on their specific problems—their depression, their lack of motivation, their social inadequacies, their boredom. But what governs all of these seemingly separate problems is our attitude, how we view the world on a daily basis. It is how we see and interpret events. Improve the overall attitude and everything else will elevate as well—creative powers, the ability to handle stress, confidence levels, relationships with people. (Greene, 2018)
Creative problem-solving techniques
	•	Learning creative problem-solving techniques does not change an analyst’s native-born talents but helps an analyst achieve his or her full potential. Most people have the ability to be more innovative than they themselves realize. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	The effectiveness of these procedures depends, in large measure, upon the analyst’s motivation, drive, and perseverance in taking the time required for thoughtful analysis despite the pressures of day-to-day duties, mail, and current intelligence reporting. (Heuer, 1999)
Creative process
	•	Beause the creative process is an elusive subject and one for which we receive no training, in our first creative endeavors, we are most often left to our own devices, to sink or swim. (Greene, 2014)
	•	First, it is essential to build into the creative process an initial period that is open-ended. You give yourself time to dream and wander, to start out in a loose and unfocused manner. In this period, you allow the project to associate itself with certain powerful emotions, ones that naturally come out of you as you focus on your ideas. (Greene, 2014)
	•	Second, it is best to have wide knowledge of your field and other fields, giving your brain more possible associations and connections. (Greene, 2014)
	•	Third, to keep this process alive, you must never settle into complacency, as if your initial vision represents the end-point. You must cultivate profound dissatisfaction with your work and the need to constantly improve your ideas, along with a sense of uncertainty – you are not exactly sure where to go next, and this uncertainty drives the creative urge and keeps it fresh.  (Greene, 2014)
	•	The single greatest action you can take for acquiring creative power is to reverse this natural impatience. You take pleasure in the laborious research process; you enjoy the slow cooking of the idea, the organic growth that naturally takes shape over time. You do not unnaturally draw out the process, which will create its own problems (we all need deadlines), but the longer you can allow the project to absorb your mental energies, the richer it will become. (Greene, 2014)
	•	Instead of a straight-line development from idea to fruition, the creative process is more like the crooked branching of a tree. (Greene, 2014)
Credibility
	•	Establishing credibility is different than establishing access. (Petersen, 2003)
	•	Credibility exists when the product is seen as relevant, timely, expert, objective, and informed. (Petersen, 2003)
	•	With credibility comes impact. There can be no impact without credibility. (Petersen, 2003)
	•	our credibility is on the line every time we write or brief. We can strengthen credibility gradually over time, or we can lose it in a heartbeat. (Petersen, 2003)
Crime
	•	« Le crime est l’acte qui froisse des états forts et définis de la conscience collective ». (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	« Le crime est l’acte (omission ou commission), considéré comme dangereux pour la majorité du groupe social. » (Mannoni, 1985)
Assault-type crimes
	•	Assault, aggravated assault, and murder are evaluated together because their threat dimensions are similar. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	Assault-type crimes can escalate to aggravated assault crimes and aggravated assault can escalate to murder. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	Criminological data indicates that assault-type crimes are committed by and against people who are similar in age, race, and gender. Thus, for assault-type crimes, the target’s characteristics will often be substantially similar to those of the adversaries.
	•	Adversarial motivation and capability for assaults, aggravated assaults, and murders are typically rooted in emotional issues. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	Target selection methods vary according to assault-type criminals. Although many assaults are driven by anger, some targets are carefully selected. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	Some assault-type crimes are very difficult to prevent. Interpersonal assaults, for instance, which occur between two known parties, are not typically deterred by security measures. (Vellani, 2007)
Crime analysis
	•	Crime analysis is a quantitative example of a threat assessment. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	Crime analysis is the most common type of threat assessment undertaken by American businesses. It is done every year at minimum, and it is sometimes completed as often as once a quarter. (Vellani, 2007)
Personal crimes
	•	Personal crimes are sometimes difficult to prevent because they can be committed as a spontaneous act of rage or because of a mental disorder. (Vellani, 2007)
Robbery
	•	Robberies are a big concern for most security decision makers and adversely affect business in a number of ways, including causing injuries, loss of property, negative reputation, and liability. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	There are two primary types of robberies: robberies of people and robberies of business. Bank robberies, shoplifting escalation, and retail holdups are business-related robberies; personal robberies include car-jacking, purse snatching, and mugging. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	Robbery target characteristics depend on the nature of the robbery. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	A robber’s motivation is typically a rational balancing of risk and reward. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	robbery opportunity-reduction strategies vary with the type of robbery occurring on the property, but generally increased physical security measures, enhanced natural and artificial surveillance, and security personnel provide protection. (Vellani, 2007)
Theft
	•	The thief’s motivation and capability are subject to the risk- and reward-balancing test. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	The thief’s capability is limited only by his or her skills and creativity. Some thieves work alone committing petty thefts, stealthy thieves may be pickpockets, and organized thieves may band together to commit larger thefts. (Vellani, 2007)
Criminal
Economic criminals
	•	Economic criminals include robbers, burglars, and thieves. (Vellani, 2007)
Environmental criminals
	•	Environmental criminals are those who seek to harm those whom they believe are damaging the environment. (Vellani, 2007)
Crises
	•	crises focused government attention on risk analysis to help build what management consultants like to call a “no surprises culture,” in which adverse events can at least be better anticipated, if not avoided (Rothstein et al., 2013:220)
	•	As such, Heath (2010) explained that “a crisis is a risk manifested” (p. 3) (Janoske et al., 2012)
	•	A crisis is a specific incident with a short time frame, while a risk is often more nebulous and evolves over time. (Janoske et al., 2012)
	•	A crisis can be viewed as a threat to an organization (Allen & Caillouet, 1994; Barton, 1992). (Coombs and Holladay, 1996)
	•	The threat reflects the potential of a crisis to do reputational (image) damage. The key reputational concerns are trustworthiness and the organization's ability to conform to the social expectations of stakeholders (DiMaggio & Powell. 1991). In turn, reputational damage can be translated into financial damage and even threaten the organization's survival. (Coombs and Holladay, 1996)
	•	A crisis is a threat or challenge to an organization's legitimacy—stakeholders question if an organization is meeting normative expectations. (Coombs and Holladay, 1996)
	•	If there is no crisis, there is neither a threat to legitimacy nor a reason to attribute responsibility for a crisis (Coombs and Holladay, 1996)
	•	A crisis event is subject to interpretation. (Coombs and Holladay, 1996)
	•	The British Standards Institute defines a crisis as “an inherently abnormal, unstable and complex situation that represents a threat to the strategic objectives, reputation or existence of an organization”. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	For Canadian government, a crisis is “a situation that threatens public safety and security, the public’s sense of tradition and values, or the integrity of the government. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	The terms ‘crisis’ and ‘emergency’ are not interchangeable. However, a crisis may become an emergency. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	most people are slow to perceive accidents, unintended consequences, coincidences, and small causes leading to large effects. (Heuer, 1999)
Crisis communication
	•	Crisis communication is seen as the cross between managing information and managing meaning during all three stages of prevention, response, and post-crisis learning (Coombs, 2010). (Janoske et al., 2012)
	•	Risk communication tends to utilize messages from experts and scientists (Janoske et al., 2012)
	•	Communication can be used to influence how stakeholders interpret a crisis and the organization in crisis. (Coombs and Holladay, 1996)
	•	An organization will use communication strategically as a response to legitimacy threats because corporate discourse does shape how stakeholders view an organization (Allen & Caillouet, 1994; Marcus & Goodman. 1991) (Coombs and Holladay, 1996)
	•	Communication can be used in attempts to influence a person's attributions, or the subsequent feelings attached to those attributions. (Coombs and Holladay, 1996)
	•	a crisis is an event for which people or publics seek causes and make attributions  (Coombs and Holladay, 1996)
	•	The remedial action helps to re-establish legitimacy by demonstrating organizational concern for societal norms (Allen & Caillouet, 1994). (Coombs and Holladay, 1996)
	•	It is the strategic, not random use of communication that protects an organizational image from damage (Allen & Caillouet, 1994). (Coombs and Holladay, 1996)
	•	risk communication practice must move away from a focus on purely instrumental techniques of persuasive communication. (Leiss, 1996)
	•	risk communication by major organizational actors can put pressure on all players in risk management to act responsibly. (Leiss, 1996)
	•	crisis communication typically utilizes messages from authoritative figures. (Janoske et al., 2012)
	•	In crisis communications, persuading the public (or reader of a press release) is a major goal of corporations. (Choi, 2012)
Crisis management
	•	One objective of crisis management is to prevent or lessen reputational damage to an organization (Barton. 1993; Pearson & Mitroff, 1993; Sturges, 1994). Attributions of organizational crisis responsibility should precipitate reputational damage. The attributions created by the publics could lead to anger and a negative image of the organization. In turn, the negative image colors future interactions between the organization and its publics. (Coombs and Holladay, 1996)
	•	Crisis management is a rapidly growing field in both practice and research (Barton, 1993). (Coombs, 1995)
	•	crisis situation, risk management actions may need to be taken before any assessment is even carried out. (Renn, 2007b)
	•	A phenomenon often seen in crisis management when first news of an impending problem arrives is a general reluctance to accept that normal life will have to be put on hold whilst everyone focuses on the emergency. (Omand, 2014)
	•	In moments of perceived crisis, we must develop the habit of maintaining our cool and never overreacting. If the situationis complex and others are reaching for simple black-and-white answers, or for the usual conventional responses, we must make a point of resisting such a temptation. We maintain our Negative Capability and a degree of detachment. What we are doing is gaining a tolerance and even a taste for chaotic moments, training ourselves ot entertain nseveral possibilities or solutions. We are learning to manage our anxiety, a key skill in these chaotic times. (Greene, 2014)
	•	Possessing even a part of such power will instantly separate us from all of the others who find themselves overwhelmed and straning to simplify what is inherently complex. We will be able to respond faster and more effectively than others. What seemed chaotic to us before will now seem to be simply a fluid situation with a particular dynamic that we have a feel for and can handle with relative ease. (Greene, 2014)
Symbolic approach to crisis management 
	•	The symbolic approach examines the strategies used to respond to crises. (Coombs and Holladay, 1996)
	•	Neoinstitutionalism and attribution theory can be merged to form a symbolic approach to crisis management. The term symbolic is used because the emphasis is on how communication strategies (symbolic resources) are used in attempts to protect organizational images. The two perspectives share a belief that communication helps to shape an organization's image and that a crisis response should be linked to the type of crisis situation. (Coombs and Holladay, 1996)
	•	The symbolic perspective assumes that accidents and transgressions vary in terms of intentional attributions, but not external attributions. Moreover, crisis type should not affect stability attributions. Stability should be a function of the number of times a crisis type has occurred, not the type of crisis. (Coombs and Holladay, 1996)
	•	The symbolic approach posits that a matched crisis response strategy should protect an image better than just providing information or randomly selecting any other crisis response strategy. (Coombs and Holladay, 1996)
Organizational crises
	•	Organizational crises render organizations newsworthy, because they threaten an organization’s reputation and financial performance (Huang, 2006, Seeger, Sellnow, & Ulmer, 2003), with stakeholders calling for an immediate repair of the disrupted order (Patriotta, Gond, & Schultz, 2011). In such crises, it may be the news which propagates the crisis rather than the incident itself, thereby affecting the corporation, its publics, and its stakeholders. (Kleinnijenhuis et al., 2015)
	•	An organizational crisis, however, gives the news a negative quality. (Kleinnijenhuis et al., 2015)
Crisis manager
	•	A crisis manager could deny a crisis event occurred or clarify the situation to prove the situation does not constitute a crisis (Allen & Caillouet, 1994; Benoit, 1995). However, there must be some concrete evidence within the supposed crisis situation that allows the crisis manager to build a case for there being no crisis (Newsom, Scott, & Turk, 1992). (Coombs and Holladay, 1996)
	•	Crisis managers might try to get stakeholders to judge the crisis less negatively. A crisis manager might emphasize the organization's lack of responsibility for a crisis or the minimal damage created by a crisis (Allen & Caillouet, 1994; Benoit, 1995). In either case, a crisis manager attempts to place distance between the organization and responsibility for the crisis event. (Coombs and Holladay, 1996)
	•	Crisis managers might try to get stakeholders to judge the organization more positively. Stakeholders might be reminded of good things the organization has done in the past (ingratiation) and/or show that the organization is taking some kind of remedial action (e.g., offer compensation to victims or create new practices to prevent a crisis event from repeating). (Coombs and Holladay, 1996)
	•	The remedial action helps to re-establish legitimacy by demonstrating organizational concern for societal norms (Allen & Caillouet, 1994). Crisis managers should take the remedial route when no evidence exists either to deny a crisis or to distance the organization from the crisis. (Coombs and Holladay, 1996)
	•	Characteristics of the crisis situation should suggest to the crisis manager the best crisis response strategy or strategies to fit the situation. (Coombs and Holladay, 1996)

Crisis response strategies
	•	Crisis response strategies seek to protect an organization by eliminating or reducing reputational damage (Allen & Caillouet, 1994). (Coombs and Holladay, 1996)
	•	Researchers have drawn upon apologia, response to embarrassment, and impression management to develop crisis response strategies (Allen & Caillouet, 1994; Benoit, 1992; Hobbs. 1995; Ice. 1991) (Coombs and Holladay, 1996)
	•	The crisis response strategies can be used to (a) show the challenge is invalid. or (b) attempt to get stakeholders to judge the crisis more mildly and evaluate the organization more positively (Allen & Caillouet, 1994). (Coombs and Holladay, 1996)
	•	Organizations must shift the focus from the violation of social norms (the crisis) to efforts designed to repair the violation. If a crisis cannot be shown to be invalid, crisis managers should use strategies that show how the organization has returned to the norms held by its stakeholders. (Coombs and Holladay, 1996)
	•	If communication can alter publics' causal attributions or affect feelings generated by these attributions, crisis response strategies could be used to reduce reputational damage. (Coombs and Holladay, 1996)
	•	Crisis response strategies can be divided into five groups: denial, distance. ingratiation, mortification, and suffering. Denial claims there was no crisis or the blame for the crisis is not the organization's. Distance accepts the crisis, but tries to weaken the link between the organization and the crisis. Ingratiation seeks to win public approval of the organization. Mortification tries to gain forgiveness for the organization. Suffering portrays the organization as a victim in the crisis (Allen & Caillouet, 1994; Benoit, 1995: Coombs, 1995). (Coombs and Holladay, 1996)
	•	Crisis response strategy selection should be related to the crisis situation. A need arises for a category system of crisis types, which then can be tied to crisis response strategies. Attribution theory provides a theory-based category system that allows for such linkages. External control and intentionality provide orthogonal dimensions that can be crossed to form a 2 x 2 matrix. External control can be divided into internal and external. Internal refers to a crisis caused by something the organization itself did. External refers to the crisis being created by some agents outside of the organization. Intentionality is divided into intentional and unintentional. Intentional refers to some actor committing the crisis act purposefully, and unintentional means the crisis event was not committed purposefully. (Coombs and Holladay, 1996)
	•	A matched crisis response strategy should better protect an image than either no response strategy or just any response (mismatched response). (Coombs and Holladay, 1996)
Distance strategy
	•	a distance strategy is proper for a one-time crisis (Coombs and Holladay, 1996)
Financial crisis
	•	As the financial crisis has shown, events rapidly spread from national markets into the global scenario. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
Remedial strategy
	•	a remedial strategy is proper for a repeated crisis, a one-time transgression, and a repeated transgression. (Coombs and Holladay, 1996)
Crisis situation 
	•	situations influence the selection of communication strategies (Bitzer, 1968: Black, 1965: Metts &Cupach. 1989. Ware & Linkugel, 1973; Wilson, Cruz. Marshall, & Rao, 1993). (Coombs and Holladay, 1996)
	•	apologia and response to embarrassment, two sources for crisis response strategies, are deeply rooted in the notion that situations influence communication strategy selection (Hobbs. 1995; Kruse, 1986; Sharkey & Stafford, 1990). (Coombs and Holladay, 1996)
	•	crisis situation should affect the selection of crisis response strategies. (Coombs and Holladay, 1996)
Crisis types
	•	The matrix yields four crisis types: 1. Accidents: unintentional and internal
2. Transgressions: intentional and internal 3. Faux pas: unintentional and external
4. Terrorism: intentional and external (Coombs and Holladay, 1996)
	•	Each crisis type can vary alone the stability dimension (Coombs and Holladay, 1996)
Accident
	•	Accidents are unintentional. (Coombs and Holladay, 1996)
	•	Accidents produce attributions of minuscule external and personal control that result in minimal perceptions of crisis responsibility. (Coombs, 1998)
	•	Accidents are unintentional and happen during the course of normal organizational operations. (Coombs, 1995)
Faux pas
	•	A faux pas is ambiguous as to whether or not a crisis exists. Some external group claims the organization has done something wrong. The ambiguity provides an opportunity to convince stakeholders there is no crisis. Denial strategies would be most useful for faux pas. (Coombs and Holladay, 1996)
0ne-time crisis
	•	A one-time crisis should be perceived as unstable and less intentional. (Coombs and Holladay, 1996)
	•	one-time occurrence reflects a more positive performance history (i.e., the crisis is an isolated incident) (Coombs and Holladay, 1996)
Repeated crisis
	•	A repeated crisis should be perceived as stable and more intentional (Griffin, 1994). If a crisis keeps happening, stake- holders begin to think it can be avoided. (Coombs and Holladay, 1996)
	•	a multiple-time occurrence reflects a more negative performance history (i.e., the crisis is one in a series of crisis events). (Coombs and Holladay, 1996)
Terrorism
	•	Terrorism is intentional by some outside actor, but is not intentionally done by the organization. For these crisis types, a crisis manager can emphasize the unintentional dimension in his or her response. (Coombs and Holladay, 1996)
	•	terrorism permits the organization to build sympathy by portraying itself as a victim. Stakeholder sympathy can help to build a more positive view of the organization (Benoit, 1992). The crisis manager would use a strategy that emphasized shared suffering with victims. (Coombs and Holladay, 1996)
Transgression
	•	Transgressions are intentional and provide no recourse but to address the organizational image. The only viable option is to improve perceptions of the organization. Neoinstitutionalism recommends boosting an image by repairing legitimacy. An organization must show how it is returning to the adherence of stakeholder expectations. Remedial strategies should be useful for transgressions. (Coombs and Holladay, 1996)
	•	Transgression crisis types should be associated with more negative organizational images than accident crisis types. Because organizations have more control over transgressions than accidents and transgressions are more intentional, transgressions are more likely to tarnish an organization's image. (Coombs and Holladay, 1996)
	•	Transgressions produce attributions of strong personal control and weak external control, a combination that should produce strong perceptions of crisis responsibility. (Coombs, 1998)
Crisis scenarios
	•	eight crisis scenarios: natural disaster, product tampering, minor damage accident (one time), major damage accident (one time), repeated minor accident, minor damage transgression (one time), major damage transgression (one time), and repeated minor transgression. (Coombs, 1998)
Crisis prediction
	•	crisis predictions must dwell more on complexity, contingent propositions, and the residual risks within a usually accurate normal theory. (Betts, 2007)
	•	there is not yet an established, compelling formulation of how to go about predicting discontinuity. (Betts, 2007)
Criticism
	•	If we learn to handle criticism well, it can strengthen us and help us become aware of flaws in our work. (Greene, 2014)
	•	these standards are standards of criticism: rational discussion consists in the attempt to criticize, and not in the attempt to prove, or to make probable. Every step that protects a view from criticism, that makes it safe, or "well founded,'' is a step away from rationality. (Feyerabend, 1993)
	•	Within the natural sciences criticism is connected with experiment and observation. The content of a theory consists in the sum total of those basic statements which contradict it; it is the class of its potential falsi- fiers. Increased content means increased vulnerability; hence theories of large content are to be preferred to theories of small content. Increase of content is welcome; decrease of content is to be avoided. A theory that contradicts an accepted basic statement must be given up. Ad hoc hy- potheses are forbidden and so on and so forth. A science, however, that accepts the rules of a critical empidcism of this kind will develop in the following manner. (Feyerabend, 1993)
Critical realism
	•	Critical realism as an approach to the philosophy of science is usually associated with the early work of Roy Bhaskar (1975, 1989) (Sottilotta, 2016)
	•	Developed in particular by Bhasker (1978, 1986), critical realism is sometimes thought of as the ‘middle way’ between positivism/empiricism and the relativism of postmodern positions. It suggests that, while there is an ‘out-there’ reality to be studied, this reality is inevitably constructed through our interpretations, leading to the existence of multiple understandings of those ‘realistes’. (Davies et al., 2002)
Critical thinking
	•	Defining critical thinking is a first step to understanding how it contributes to intelligence analysis.  Richard Paul and Linda Elder, of  the Foundation for Critical Thinking, consider it to bethat mode of  thinking – about any subject, content, or problem– in which the [solitary] thinker improves the quality of his or her thinking by skillfully taking charge of  the structures inherent  in  thinking  and  imposing  intellectual  standards upon them. (Moore and Center for Strategic Intelligence Research (U.S.), 2007)
	•	In other words, critical thinking is both a deliberate meta-cognitive (thinking about thinking) and cognitive (thinking) act whereby a person reflects on the quality of  the reasoning process simultaneously while reasoning to a conclusion.  The thinker has two equally important goals: improving the way she or he reasons and coming to a correct solution. (Moore and Center for Strategic Intelligence Research (U.S.), 2007)

Crowd
	•	People in a crowd are highly suggestible. Through short, simple phrases, with lots of repetition, they can be made to chant back slogans and swallow the most absurd and irrational ideas. In a crowd people can feel relieved of any personal responsibility, which can lead to violence. They feel transported beyond themselves and not so puny, but such enlargement is an illusion. They are actually made smaller by losing their will and their individual voice. (Greene, 2018)
	•	On s’attendait à ce qu’accèdent à la scène de l’histoire des peuples enfin autonomes et responsables, souverains, en un mot. Or, par une étrange alchimie, ces peuples sont devenus, sous nos yeux, des masses, confuses réalités, avatars du modernisme. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	les foules humaines, devenues masses, posent aujourd’hui le problème de leur puissance et de leur impuissance, en tout cas de leur expansion dans le présent, là où la science sociale ne cherche peut-être plus qu’à appréhender l’expansion du présent. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	G. Le Bon (op. cit., p. 2) déjà l’annonçait clairement : « L’âge où nous entrons sera véritablement l’ère des foules. » Les sociétés de demain auront, en effet, selon lui, à compter avec cette nouvelle puissance susceptible même d’en imposer aux princes.
	•	NOTE: avec l'ère des masses, les foulles sont une nouvelle puissance capable d'en imposer aux princes. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Ce pouvoir des foules serait lié notamment à « l’avènement des classes populaires à la vie politique » et à « l’association graduelle des individus ». Celle-ci permettrait « aux foules de se former des idées, sinon très justes, au moins très arrêtées de leurs intérêts et de prendre conscience de leur force ». (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	l’individu perd à la fois son esprit critique et le sentiment de soi, et se découvre, avec angoisse, manipulé par des forces hostiles et inconnues. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	nos sociétés, suivant Katz et Lazarsfeld (1955) par exemple, ne sont peut-être pas aussi massifiées qu’on veut bien le croire. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	qu’est-ce qu’une foule ? Selon S. Moscovici (op. cit., p. 103, 105), trois réponses ont été classiquement proposes. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	1) Les masses sont des agrégats d’individus en rupture de ban, elles sont asociales et formées d’asociaux. C’est la populace, la canaille, le Lumpenproletariat, la plèbe, menaçant à tout moment de provoquer du désordre. 2) Les foules sont folles. 3) Enfin, les foules sont criminelles et capables de tueries et de destruction. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	les foules font donc leur entrée dans la science par le biais de la criminalité. (...) Ainsi les foules, citadines et ouvrières, ont été d’emblée psychiatrisées et criminalisées ».
	•	tout le monde fait partie de la foule, c’est-à-dire tous les citoyens et pas seulement la canaille. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	d’autres auteurs parlent plus volontiers de comportement collectif. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	un rassemblement d’individus hétérogène, temporaire, inorganique sans attente définie ». (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	les foules actives (aggressive, escape, acquisitive et expressive) auxquelles il réserve le terme de mob, et les foules passives qu’il appelle audiences. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Pour von Wiese, la masse est une unité collective dont les membres ne se représentent pas l’existence comme durable ; c’est un ensemble réagissant uniformément à un sort identique (...). (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Selon G. Gurvitch, la masse doit désigner une forme élémentaire de sociabilité, et non un type concret de groupement. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Si l’on en croit encore une fois S. Moscovici (op. cit., p. 354 sq.), foules et masses sont des termes équivalents et, du moins du point de vue psychologique, les deux mots ont le même sens. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Pour J. Baudrillard le flou est encore plus marqué, et, pour lui, les « majorités silencieuses » ne sont qu’un « référent spongieux, (...) réalité opaque et translucide à la fois, (...) (qui renvoient à) ce néant : les masses ». (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Agrégées, sinon unifiées, par les moyens de communication et les meneurs. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	masses appesantissant sans cesse leur actualité interpellent tant par leurs manifestations organiques que par les rapports qu’elles nouent sous nos yeux avec l’histoire, oscillant entre la démocratie et le despotisme, passant de l’un à l’autre sans s’en rendre compte et atteignant l’un en poursuivant l’autre. Remarquons, en passant, qu’ainsi se trouve vérifiée la prophétie de Le Bon. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Les témoins sont unanimes. Tous ceux qui ont assisté aux manifestations de violence de la foule en attestent : l’horreur est la règle. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	C’est à croire que lorsque la foule s’assemble, pour peu que la passion s’en mêle et qu’un meneur l’excite, elle se met en quête d’un exécutoire sur lequel décharger ses tensions. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	C’est probablement ce qui explique que Sighele et Le Bon, effrayés, n’aient pas hésité à criminaliser la foule. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	l’individu est un résidu. Il ne cesse d’appartenir à un public que pour se retrouver dans une foule et vice versa, ou bien il ne sort d’un public que pour entrer dans un autre ». (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	une foule possède une certaine unité de composition et de fonction. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Pour G. Le Bon, l’homme en situation de foule serait doté de nouvelles propriétés dont l’apparition se trouve liée à trois causes différentes. La première serait « un sentiment de puissance invincible » (op. cit., p. 13) auquel le sujet s’abandonne d’autant plus facilement qu’il se sent couvert par l’anonymat, ce qui provoque la dissolution de sa responsabilité, capable de faire obstacle à ses instincts lorsqu’il est seul. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	La seconde cause est « la contagion mentale » (ibid.) que l’auteur rattache aux phénomènes d’ordre hypnotique. « Chez une foule, écrit-il, tout sentiment, tout acte est contagieux à ce point que l’individu sacrifie très facilement son intérêt personnel à l’intérêt collectif. C’est là une aptitude contraire à sa nature, et dont l’homme ne devient guère capable que lorsqu’il fait partie d’une foule. ». (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Le troisième facteur, qui est de loin le plus important pour G. Le Bon, c’est la « suggestibilité » (ibid.). Croyant s’engager alors sur le terrain ferme de la physiologie, il postule la quasi-identité de l’état de l’individu en foule avec l’état hypnotique. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Il n’est plus lui-même, mais un automate que sa volonté est devenue impuissante à guider ». (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	le manieur d’hommes qui exerce sur chacun une fascination que Le Bon appelle « la séduction ». C’est une autre manière de nommer le charisme des meneurs dont nous avons déjà parlé.
	•	En étendant ainsi la notion de libido et en la désexualisant, on peut comprendre que l’individu englobé dans la masse se mette au diapason des autres pour s’attirer leur amour. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	les individus composant les foules sont, chacun pour soi mais tous ensemble, attachés au chef. La libido a donc, de la sorte, une double direction : horizontale (des hommes entre eux) et verticale (des hommes au meneur). S. Moscovici (op. cit., p. 329) résume d’une formule : « Les hommes vivent en société, non parce qu’ils sont somnambules, mais parce qu’ils sont amoureux. » (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Le sentiment de force inhérent au fait d’être en groupe s’exalte et réactualise les vieux fantasmes de toute-puissance. En même temps que certains aspects du Moi se développent démesurément, le Ça se libère en violentes décharges où le sadisme a sa part. Chacun satisfait ainsi sporadiquement mais intensément toutes les tendances profondes que la régression le contraint habituellement à refouler. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Pour F.H. Allport (1924), le phénomène s’explique en termes d’interstimulation, chacun devenant un « stimulus » pour l’autre, ils s’induisent mutuellement à adopter tel ou tel type d’attitude. Relevant d’une psychologie plus dynamique que la « contagion mentale », cette notion permet de mieux saisir les raisons des modifications émotionnelles que connaissent les sujets lorsqu’ils sont immergés dans la masse : des hommes agissent autour d’eux créant ainsi une sollicitation qui les incite à passer à leur tour à l’action. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	L’individu dans une foule reçoit donc de la part de ceux qui l’entourent une série de stimulations auxquelles il a tendance à répondre positivement en même temps qu’il devient lui aussi source de comportement pour les autres ou, tout au moins, facteur de renforcement de leur comportement par le fait qu’il s’y est associé : on peut y voir une illustration des phénomènes de rétroaction positive (dont les effets risquent d’être indéfiniment renforcés). (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	qu’il est exaltant et gratifiant de se trouver au milieu d’un grand nombre d’individus qui, tous, témoignent des mêmes sentiments que soi. Chacun a l’impression de respirer alors avec les poumons de la foule et il peut trouver, dans ces moments de forte intensité émotionnelle partagée, les justifications et les confirmations personnelles dont il ne bénéficie pas en temps ordinaire. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Il est alors effectivement difficile, pour ne pas dire dangereux, de marquer de la tiédeur et, a fortiori, un certain désaccord. Celui qui ne s’engage pas avec les autres et reste en marge de l’action collective peut être perçu par la foule comme ne faisant pas partie du groupe. Aussi les voyeurs, les raisonneurs et tous ceux qui, en général, marquent peu d’ardeur, encourent l’hostilité de leurs voisins et se voient exposés à l’agressivité la plus extrême parfois. Sans avoir besoin d’en faire le calcul, chacun est intimement convaincu de ce que les autres attendent de lui et, bon gré mal gré, il lui faut épouser ce « rôle » et oublier sa propre personnalité. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Au même titre que la vie individuelle, la vie des groupes est marquée par l’alternance. ponctuée de temps à autre par un événement saillant. Celui-ci peut avoir un caractère purement occasionnel ou accidentel (guerre, séisme, épidémie) ou se présenter, au contraire, sous les aspects d’un phénomène récurrent. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Le Bon ramenait tout à l’hypnose et à la suggestion mais son successeur en psychologie des foules propose, à leur place, l’amour : « Par l’adjonction d’éléments érotiques, affirme-t-il, les penchants égoïstes se transforment en penchants sociaux. On ne tarde pas à constater qu’être aimé est un avantage auquel on peut et doit sacrifier beaucoup d’autres ». (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	les comportemetns sont “conjugués” au pluriel et multiplies à l’infini des masses dont l’avènement constitue vraisemblablement un des problems les plus marquants des temps modernes. Partout hommes et femmes sous l’influence notamment des récents moyens de communication de masse, se fondent dans les cortèges, assemblées ou publics de dizaines de milliers, voire de millions d’individus. Ces foules gigantesques sont animées d’un dynamique don’t on ne peut ignorer, à notre époque scientifique, les sevrets mécanismes. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Mais la masse n’est pas seulement une entité physique. Elle a également une psychologie et celle-ci est dominée par la détresse. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Observées dans la plupart de leurs actes, les foules font preuve le plus souvent d'une mentalité singulièrement inférieure; mais il est d'autres actes aussi où elles paraissent guidées par ces forces mystérieuses que les anciens appelaient destin, nature, providence, que nous appelons voix des morts, et dont nous ne saurions méconnaître la puissance, bien que nous ignorions leur essence. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	pour les idées de génie des grands hommes, sommes-nous bien certains qu'elles soient exclusivement leur œuvre? Sans doute elles sont toujours créées par des esprits solitaires; mais les milliers de grains de poussière qui forment l'alluvion où ces idées ont germé, n'est-ce pas l'âme des foules qui les a formés? (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Les foules, sans doute, sont toujours inconscientes; mais cette inconscience même est peut-être un des secrets de leur force. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	il nous faut constater simplement les phénomènes qui nous sont accessibles, et nous borner à cette constatation. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	derrière les phénomènes que nous voyons bien, il en est d'autres que nous voyons mal, et peut-être même, derrière ces derniers, d'autres encore que nous ne voyons pas. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Les grands changements de civilisation sont la conséquence de changements dans la pensée des peuples. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	qu'il n'est rien d'aussi stable dans une race que le fond héréditaire de ses pensées. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	la pensée des hommes est en voie de se transformer. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	l'âge moderne représente une période de transition et d'anarchie. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	une puissance nouvelle, dernière souveraine de l'âge moderne: la puissance des foules. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	la puissance des foules est la seule force que rien ne menace et dont le prestige ne fasse que grandir. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Il y a un siècle à peine, la politique traditionnelle des États et les rivalités des princes étaient les principaux facteurs des événements. L'opinion des foules ne comptait guère, et même, le plus souvent, ne comptait pas. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	la voix des foules qui est devenue prépondérante. Elle dicte aux rois leur conduite, et c'est elle qu'ils tâchent d'entendre. Ce n'est plus dans les conseils des princes, mais dans l'âme des foules que se préparent les destinées des nations. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	La naissance progressive de la puissance des foules s'est faite d'abord par la propagation de certaines idées qui se sont lentement implantées dans les esprits, puis par l'association graduelle des individus, pour amener la réalisation des conceptions théoriques. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	C'est par l'association que les foules ont fini par se former des idées, sinon très justes, au moins très arrêtées de leurs intérêts et par avoir conscience de leur force. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	les revendications des foules deviennent de plus en plus nettes, et ne vont pas à moins qu'à détruire de fond en comble la société actuelle, pour la ramener à ce communisme primitif qui fut l'état normal de tous les groupes humains avant l'aurore de la civilisation. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Peu aptes au raisonnement, les foules sont au contraire très aptes à l'action. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	l'avènement des foules marque une des dernières étapes des civilisations de l'Occident, un retour complet vers ces périodes d'anarchie confuse qui semblent devoir toujours précéder l'éclosion de chaque société nouvelle. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Les civilisations n'ont été créées et guidées jusqu'ici que par une petite aristocratie intellectuelle, jamais par les foules. Les foules n'ont de puissance que pour détruire. Leur domination représente toujours une phase de barbarie. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Une civilisation implique des règles fixes, une discipline, le passage de l'instinctif au rationnel, la prévoyance de l'avenir, un degré élevé de culture, conditions que les foules, abandonnées à elles-mêmes, se sont toujours montrées absolument incapables de réaliser. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Quand l'édifice d'une civilisation est vermoulu, ce sont toujours les foules qui en amènent l'écroulement. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Sans doute il existe des foules criminelles, mais il existe aussi des foules vertueuses, des foules héroïques, et encore bien d'autres. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	les maîtres du monde, tous les fondateurs de religions ou d'empires, les apôtres de toutes les croyances, les hommes d'État éminents, et, dans une sphère plus modeste, les simples chefs de petites collectivités humaines, ont toujours été des psychologues inconscients. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	le mot foule représente une réunion d'individus quelconques, quels que soient leur nationalité, leur profession ou leur sexe, et quels que soient aussi les hasards qui les rassemblent. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Au point de vue psychologique, l'expression foule prend une signification tout autre. Dans certaines circonstances données, et seulement dans ces circonstances, une agglomération d'hommes possède des caractères nouveaux fort différents de ceux des individus composant cette agglomération. La personnalité consciente s'évanouit, les sentiments et les idées de toutes les unités sont orientés dans une même direction. Il se forme une âme collective, transitoire sans doute, mais présentant des caractères très nets. La collectivité est alors devenue ce que, faute d'une expression meilleure, j'appellerai une foule organisée, ou, si l'on préfère, une foule psychologique. Elle forme un seul être et se trouve soumise à la loi de l'unité mentale des foules. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Mille individus accidentellement réunis sur une place publique sans aucun but déterminé, ne constituent nullement une foule au point de vue psychologique. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Pour en acquérir les caractères spéciaux, il faut l'influence de certains excitants dont nous aurons à déterminer la nature. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Des milliers d'individus séparés peuvent à certains moments, sous l'influence de certaines émotions violentes, un grand événement national par exemple, acquérir les caractères d'une foule psychologique. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Lorsqu'une foule psychologique est constituée, elle acquiert des caractères généraux provisoires, mais déterminables. À ces caractères généraux s'ajoutent des caractères particuliers, variables, suivant les éléments dont la foule se compose et qui peuvent en modifier la constitution mentale. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Les foules psychologiques sont donc susceptibles d'une classification. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Il n'est pas facile de décrire avec exactitude l'âme des foules, parce que son organisation varie non seulement suivant la race et la composition des collectivités, mais encore suivant la nature et le degré des excitants auxquels ces collectivités sont soumises. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Seule l'uniformité des milieux crée l'uniformité apparente des caractères. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	ils possèdent une sorte d'âme collective qui les fait sentir, penser, et agir d'une façon tout à fait différente de celle dont sentirait, penserait et agirait chacun d'eux isolément. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Il est facile de constater combien l'individu en foule diffère de l'individu isolé; mais il est moins facile de découvrir les causes de cette différence. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Dans l'âme collective, les aptitudes intellectuelles des individus, et par conséquent leur individualité, s'effacent. L'hétérogène se noie dans l'homogène, et les qualités inconscientes dominent. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Les décisions d'intérêt général prises par une assemblée d'hommes distingués, mais de spécialités différentes, ne sont pas sensiblement supérieures aux décisions que prendrait une réunion d'imbéciles. Ils ne peuvent mettre en commun en effet que ces qualités médiocres que tout le monde possède. Dans les foules, c'est la bêtise et non l'esprit, qui s'accumule. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	La première est que l'individu en foule acquiert, par le fait seul du nombre, un sentiment de puissance invincible qui lui permet de céder à des instincts que, seul, il eût forcément refrénés. Il sera d'autant moins porté à les refréner que, la foule étant anonyme, et par conséquent irresponsable, le sentiment de la responsabilité, qui retient toujours les individus, disparaît entièrement. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Dans une foule, tout sentiment, tout acte est contagieux, et contagieux à ce point que l'individu sacrifie très facilement son intérêt personnel à l'intérêt collectif.
	•	détermine dans les individus en foule des caractères spéciaux parfois tout à fait contraires à ceux de l'individu isolé. Je veux parler de la suggestibilité, dont la contagion mentionnée plus haut n'est d'ailleurs qu'un effet. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	La vie du cerveau étant paralysée chez le sujet hypnotisé, celui-ci devient l'esclave de toutes les activités inconscientes de sa moelle épinière, que l'hypnotiseur dirige à son gré. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Tel est à peu près aussi l'état de l'individu faisant partie d'une foule psychologique. Il n'est plus conscient de ses actes. Chez lui, comme chez l'hypnotisé, en même temps que certaines facultés sont détruites, d'autres peuvent être amenées à un degré d'exaltation extrême. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	par le fait seul qu'il fait partie d'une foule organisée, l'homme descend de plusieurs degrés sur l'échelle de la civilisation. Isolé, c'était peut-être un individu cultivé, en foule c'est un barbare, c'est-à-dire un instinctif. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	L'individu en foule est un grain de sable au milieu d'autres grains de sable que le vent soulève à son gré. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	renoncer à leur inviolabilité et à se décimer eux-mêmes. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	la foule est toujours intellectuellement inférieure à l'homme isolé, mais que, au point de vue des sentiments et des actes que ces sentiments provoquent, elle peut, suivant les circonstances, être meilleure ou pire. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Tout dépend de la façon dont la foule est suggestionnée. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	La foule est le jouet de toutes les excitations extérieures et en reflète les incessantes variations.—Les impulsions auxquelles elle obéit sont assez impérieuses pour que l'intérêt personnel s'efface.—Rien n'est prémédité chez les foules.—Action (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Leur obéissance aux suggestions.—Les images évoquées dans leur esprit sont prises par elles pour des réalités.—Pourquoi (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Les foules ne connaissent ni le doute ni l'incertitude et vont toujours aux extrêmes.—Leurs sentiments sont toujours excessifs. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Les instincts révolutionnaires momentanés des foules ne les empêchent pas d'être extrêmement conservatrices.—Elles sont d'instinct hostiles aux changements et au progrès. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	parmi les caractères spéciaux des foules, il en est plusieurs, tels que l'impulsivité, l'irritabilité, l'incapacité de raisonner, l'absence de jugement et d'esprit critique, l'exagération des sentiments, et d'autres encore, que l'on observe également chez les êtres appartenant à des formes inférieures d'évolution. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	La foule, avons-nous dit en étudiant ses caractères fondamentaux, est conduite presque exclusivement par l'inconscient. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Les actes exécutés peuvent être parfaits quant à leur exécution, mais, le cerveau ne les dirigeant pas, l'individu agit suivant les hasards des excitations. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Une foule est le jouet de toutes les excitations extérieures et en reflète les incessantes variations. Elle est donc esclave des impulsions qu'elle reçoit. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	l'individu isolé possède l'aptitude à dominer ses réflexes, alors que la foule ne la possède pas. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Rien donc ne saurait être prémédité chez les foules. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	si les foules veulent les choses avec frénésie, elles ne les veulent pas bien longtemps. Elles sont aussi incapables de volonté durable que de pensée. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	La foule n'est pas seulement impulsive et mobile. Comme le sauvage, elle n'admet pas que quelque chose puisse s'interposer entre son désir et la réalisation de ce désir. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Pour l'individu en foule, la notion d'impossibilité disparaît. L'individu isolé sent bien qu'il ne pourrait à lui seul incendier un palais, piller un magasin, et, s'il en est tenté, il résistera aisément à sa tentation. Faisant partie d'une foule, il a conscience du pouvoir que lui donne le nombre, et il suffit de lui suggérer des idées de meurtre et de pillage pour qu'il cède immédiatement à la tentation. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	l'état normal de la foule contrariée est la fureur. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Toutes les foules sont toujours irritables et impulsives, sans doute, mais avec de grandes variations de degré. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Si neutre qu'on la suppose, la foule se trouve le plus souvent dans cet état d'attention expectante qui rend la suggestion facile. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	errant toujours sur les limites de l'inconscience, subissant aisément toutes les suggestions, ayant toute la violence de sentiments propre aux êtres qui ne peuvent faire appel aux influences de la raison, dépourvue de tout esprit critique, la foule ne peut qu'être d'une crédulité excessive. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Quels que soient les sentiments, bons ou mauvais, manifestés par une foule, ils présentent ce double caractère d'être très simples et très exagérés. Sur ce point, comme sur tant d'autres, l'individu en foule se rapproche des êtres primitifs. Inaccessible aux nuances, il voit les choses en bloc et ne connaît pas les transitions. Dans la foule, l'exagération des sentiments est fortifiée par ce fait, qu'un sentiment manifesté se propageant très vite par voie de suggestion et de contagion, l'approbation évidente dont il est l'objet accroît considérablement sa force. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	La simplicité et l'exagération des sentiments des foules font que ces dernières ne connaissent ni le doute ni l'incertitude. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	La violence des sentiments des foules est encore exagérée, dans les foules hétérogènes surtout, par l'absence de responsabilité. La certitude de l'impunité, certitude d'autant plus forte que la foule est plus nombreuse, et la notion d'une puissance momentanée considérable due au nombre, rendent possibles à la collectivité des sentiments et des actes impossibles à l'individu isolé. Dans les foules, l'imbécile, l'ignorant et l'envieux sont libérés du sentiment de leur nullité et de leur impuissance, que remplace la notion d'une force brutale, passagère, mais immense. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	L'exagération, chez les foules, porte malheureusement souvent sur de mauvais sentiments, reliquat atavique des instincts de l'homme primitif, que la crainte du châtiment oblige l'individu isolé et responsable à refréner. C'est ce qui fait que les foules sont si facilement conduites aux pires excès. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	la foule n'est impressionnée que par des sentiments excessifs. L'orateur qui veut la séduire doit abuser des affirmations violentes. Exagérer, affirmer, répéter, et ne jamais tenter de rien démontrer par un raisonnement, sont des procédés d'argumentation bien connus des orateurs des réunions populaires. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	La foule veut encore la même exagération dans les sentiments de ses héros. Leurs qualités et leurs vertus apparentes doivent toujours être amplifiées. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	L'art de parler aux foules est d'ordre inférieur sans doute, mais exige des aptitudes toutes spéciales. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	l'exagération des foules ne porte que sur les sentiments, et en aucune façon sur l'intelligence. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	par le fait seul que l'individu est en foule, son niveau intellectuel baisse immédiatement et considérablement. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Les foules ne connaissant que les sentiments simples et extrêmes; les opinions, idées et croyances qui leur sont suggérées sont acceptées ou rejetées par elles en bloc, et considérées comme des vérités absolues ou des erreurs non moins absolues.
	•	la foule est aussi autoritaire qu'intolérante. L'individu peut supporter la contradiction et la discussion, la foule ne les supportent jamais. Dans les réunions publiques, la plus légère contradiction de la part d'un orateur est immédiatement accueillie par des hurlements de fureur et de violentes invectives, bientôt suivis de voies de fait et d'expulsion pour peu que l'orateur insiste. Sans la présence inquiétante des agents de l'autorité, le contradicteur serait même fréquemment massacré. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	L'autoritarisme et l'intolérance sont pour les foules des sentiments très clairs, qu'elles conçoivent aisément et qu'elles acceptent aussi facilement qu'elles les pratiquent, dès qu'on les leur impose. Les foules respectent docilement la force et sont médiocrement impressionnées par la bonté, qui n'est guère pour elles qu'une forme de la faiblesse. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Le type du héros cher aux foules aura toujours la structure d'un César. Son panache les séduit, son autorité leur impose et son sabre leur fait peur. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Toujours prête à se soulever contre une autorité faible, la foule se courbe avec servilité devant une autorité forte. Si la force de l'autorité est intermittente, la foule, obéissant toujours à ses sentiments extrêmes, passe alternativement de l'anarchie à la servitude, et de la servitude à l'anarchie. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	En fait, elles ont des instincts conservateurs aussi irréductibles que ceux de tous les primitifs. Leur respect fétichiste pour les traditions est absolu, leur horreur inconsciente de toutes les nouveautés capables de changer leurs conditions réelles d'existence, est tout à fait profonde. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	le mot de moralité dans le sens de respect constant de certaines conventions sociales et de répression permanente des impulsions égoïstes, il est bien évident que les foules sont trop impulsives et trop mobiles pour être susceptibles de moralité. Mais si, dans le terme de moralité, nous faisons entrer l'apparition momentanée de certaines qualités telles que l'abnégation, le dévouement, le désintéressement, le sacrifice de soi-même, le besoin d'équité, nous pouvons dire que les foules sont au contraire parfois susceptibles d'une moralité très haute. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Dans la vie de l'individu isolé, il lui serait dangereux de les satisfaire, alors que son absorption dans une foule irresponsable, et où par conséquent l'impunité est assurée, lui donne toute liberté pour les suivre. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Seules les collectivités sont capables de grands désintéressements et de grands dévouements. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	L'intérêt personnel est bien rarement un mobile puissant chez les foules, alors qu'il est le mobile à peu près exclusif de l'individu isolé. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Cette moralisation de l'individu par la foule n'est certes pas une règle constante, mais c'est une règle qui s'observe fréquemment. Elle s'observe même dans des circonstances beaucoup moins graves que celles que je viens de citer. J'ai déjà dit qu'au théâtre la foule veut chez le héros de la pièce des vertus exagérées, et il est d'une observation banale qu'une assistance, même composée d'éléments inférieurs, se montre généralement très prude. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Ne nous plaignons pas trop que les foules soient guidées surtout par l'inconscient, et ne raisonnent guère. Si elles avaient raisonné quelquefois et consulté leurs intérêts immédiats, aucune civilisation ne se fût développée peut-être à la surface de notre planète, et l'humanité n'aurait pas eu d'histoire. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Les foules ne sont pas influençables par des raisonnements. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Les idées qu'elles associent n'ont que des apparences d'analogie ou de succession. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Elles pensent par images, et ces images se succèdent sans aucun lien. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Le merveilleux et le légendaire sont les vrais supports des civilisations.—L'imagination populaire a toujours été la base de la puissance des hommes d'État. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Quelles que soient les idées suggérées aux foules, elles ne peuvent devenir dominantes qu'à la condition de revêtir une forme très absolue et très simple. Elles se présentent alors sous l'aspect d'images, et ne sont accessibles aux masses que sous cette forme. Ces idées-images ne sont rattachées entre elles par aucun lien logique d'analogie ou de succession, et peuvent se substituer l'une à l'autre comme les verres de la lanterne magique que l'opérateur retire de la boîte où ils étaient superposés. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	sous l'influence d'idées antérieures devenues des sentiments; et ce sont celles-là seules qui agissent sur les mobiles profonds de nos actes et de nos discours. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	lorsque, par des procédés divers, une idée a fini par pénétrer dans l'âme des foules, elle possède une puissance irrésistible et déroule toute une série d'effets qu'il faut subir. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	les foules sont-elles toujours, au point de vue des idées, en retard de plusieurs générations sur les savants et les philosophes. Tous les hommes d'État savent bien aujourd'hui ce que contiennent d'erroné les idées fondamentales que je citais à l'instant, mais comme leur influence est très puissante encore, ils sont obligés de gouverner suivant des principes à la vérité desquels ils ne croient plus. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Nous avons montré que les foules ne raisonnent pas; qu'elles admettent ou rejettent les idées en bloc; ne supportent ni discussion, ni contradiction, et que les suggestions agissant sur elles envahissent entièrement le champ de leur entendement et tendent aussitôt à se transformer en actes. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	les foules convenablement suggestionnées sont prêtes à se sacrifier pour l'idéal qui leur a été suggéré. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	qu'elles ne connaissent que les sentiments violents et extrêmes, que, chez elles, la sympathie devient vite adoration, et qu'à peine née l'antipathie se transforme en haine. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	convictions revêtent toujours une forme spéciale. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Il y a des phénomènes sociaux qu'il faut étudier en psychologue beaucoup plus qu'en naturaliste. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Les conservateurs les plus tenaces des idées traditionnelles, et qui s'opposent le plus obstinément à leur changement, sont précisément les foules, et notamment les catégories de foules qui constituent les castes. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	ce ne sont pas les institutions qui agissent alors, puisque nous savons que, triomphantes ou vaincues, elles ne possèdent par elles-mêmes aucune vertu. Ce qui a agi sur l'âme des foules, ce sont des illusions et des mots. Des mots surtout, ces mots chimériques et puissants dont nous montrerons bientôt l'étonnant empire. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Si nous voulons comprendre les idées, les croyances qui y germent aujourd'hui, et qui écloront demain, il faut savoir comment le terrain a été préparé. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Il était donc nécessaire de montrer comment le système actuel l'a façonnée, et comment la masse des indifférents et des neutres est devenue progressivement une immense armée de mécontents, prête à obéir à toutes les suggestions des utopistes et des rhéteurs. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	La puissance des mots est liée aux images qu'ils évoquent et est indépendante de leur sens réel.—Ces images varient d'âge en âge, de race en race. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	les foules ont toujours subi l'influence des illusions. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	L'âme de la race représente l'état de civilisation et l'âme de la foule l'état de barbarie. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	L'état de foule et la domination des foules, c'est la barbarie ou le retour à la barbarie. C'est en acquérant une âme solidement constituée que la race se soustrait de plus en plus à la puissance irréfléchie des foules et sort de la barbarie. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Avec l'influence grandissante des foules et les capitulations successives des pouvoirs devant elles, nous sommes appelés à en voir bien d'autres. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Redoutons la puissance des foules, mais redoutons beaucoup plus encore la puissance de certaines castes. Les premières peuvent se laisser convaincre, les secondes ne fléchissent jamais. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Les foules ont des opinions imposées, jamais des opinions raisonnées. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	In The Crowd Le Bon provided a preliminary handbook for people interested in “managing the human climate,” offering advice on the usefulness of images and theatrics as tools of persuasion, and making continual reference to the unconscious powers of suggestion. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	“Crowds have always undergone the influence of illusions,” he wrote, “Whoever can supply them with illusions is easily their master. Whoever attempts to destroy their illusions is always their victim.” For Le Bon, to exert control over the social order in a democratic age a “small intellectual aristocracy,” adept in the application of mass psychology, was essential. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	To Mr. Martin the crowd is rather a state of mind, “the peculiar mental condition which sometimes occurs when people think and act together, either immediately where the members of the group are present and in close contact, or remotely, as when people think as when they affect one another in a certain way through the medium of an organization, a party or sect, the press, etc.” (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	Mr. Martin pictures society as an aggregation of people who have sacrificed individual freedom in order to remain within the group. This sacrifice of freedom on the part of individuals in the group leads its members to resist all efforts at fundamental changes in the group code. Because all have made certain sacrifices, reasons are developed why such sacrifices must be insisted upon at all times. The “logic-proof” compartment is the result of this unwillingness to accept changes. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	Each group, therefore, within itself, considers its own standards ultimate and indisputable, and tends to dismiss all contrary or different standards as indefensible.
	•	The main satisfaction, Mr. Martin thinks, which the individual derives from his group association is the satisfaction of his vanity through the creation of an enlarged self-importance. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	The crowd is a state of mind which permeates society and its individuals at almost all times. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
Active crowd
	•	les foules actives (aggressive, escape, acquisitive et expressive). (Mannoni, 1985)
Criminal crowd
	•	Une foule peut être légalement mais non psychologiquement criminelle. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Les foules tombant, après une certaine période d'excitation, à l'état de simples automates inconscients menés par des suggestions, il semble difficile de les qualifier dans aucun cas de criminelles. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Les crimes des foules ont généralement pour mobile une suggestion puissante, et les individus qui y ont pris part sont persuadés ensuite qu'ils ont obéi à un devoir, ce qui n'est pas du tout le cas du criminel ordinaire. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Les foules tombant, après une certaine période d'excitation, à l'état de simples automates inconscients menés par des suggestions. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	On voit clairement ici le mécanisme indiqué plus haut. Obéissance à une suggestion d'autant plus puissante qu'elle est collective, conviction chez le meurtrier qu'il a commis un acte fort méritoire, et conviction d'autant plus naturelle qu'il a pour lui l'approbation unanime de ses concitoyens. Un acte semblable peut être légalement, mais non psychologiquement, qualifié de criminel. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Les caractères généraux des foules dites criminelles sont exactement ceux que nous avons constatés chez toutes les foules: suggestibilité, crédulité, mobilité, exagération des sentiments bons ou mauvais, manifestation de certaines formes de moralité, etc. (Lebon, 1895)
Crowd belief
	•	“L’important n’est pas la réalité de la vie, écrit R. Micchielli (1972, p.34), mais ce que les gens croient.” (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	il faut une religion aux foules, puisque toutes les croyances politiques, divines et sociales ne s'établissent chez elles qu'à la condition de revêtir toujours la forme religieuse, qui les met à l'abri de la discussion. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	La Réforme, la Saint-Barthélemy, les guerres de Religion, l'Inquisition, la Terreur, sont des phénomènes d'ordre identique, accomplis par des foules animées de ces sentiments religieux qui conduisent nécessairement à extirper sans pitié, par le fer et le feu, tout ce qui s'oppose à l'établissement de la nouvelle croyance. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Les facteurs qui déterminent ces opinions et ces croyances sont de deux ordres: les facteurs lointains et les facteurs immédiats. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Les facteurs lointains sont ceux qui rendent les foules capables d'adopter certaines convictions et absolument inaptes à se laisser pénétrer par certaines autres. Ces facteurs préparent le terrain où l'on voit germer tout à coup certaines idées nouvelles, dont la force et les résultats étonnent, mais qui n'ont de spontané que l'apparence. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Les facteurs immédiats sont ceux qui, se superposant à ce long travail, sans lequel ils n'auraient pas d'effet, provoquent la persuasion active chez les foules, c'est-à-dire font prendre forme à l'idée et la déchaînent avec toutes ses conséquences. Par ces facteurs immédiats surgissent les résolutions qui soulèvent brusquement les collectivités; par eux éclate une émeute ou se décide une grève; par eux des majorités énormes portent un homme au pouvoir ou renversent un gouvernement. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Si nous voulons comprendre les idées, les croyances qui y germent aujourd'hui, et qui écloront demain, il faut savoir comment le terrain a été préparé. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Il était donc nécessaire de montrer comment le système actuel l'a façonnée, et comment la masse des indifférents et des neutres est devenue progressivement une immense armée de mécontents, prête à obéir à toutes les suggestions des utopistes et des rhéteurs. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	C'est surtout par le mécanisme de la contagion, jamais par celui du raisonnement, que se propagent les opinions et les croyances des foules. (Lebon, 1895)
Crowd conditioning
	•	Lorsqu'il s'agit d'entraîner une foule pour un instant, et de la déterminer à commettre un acte quelconque: piller un palais, se faire massacrer pour défendre une place forte ou une barricade, il faut agir sur elle par des suggestions rapides, dont la plus énergique est encore l'exemple; mais il faut alors que la foule soit déjà préparée par certaines circonstances, et surtout que celui qui veut l'entraîner possède la qualité que j'étudierai plus loin sous le nom de prestige. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	quand il s'agit de faire pénétrer des idées et des croyances dans l'esprit des foules—les théories sociales modernes, par exemple—les procédés des meneurs sont différents. Ils ont principalement recours à trois procédés très nets: l'affirmation, la répétition, la contagion. L'action en est assez lente, mais les effets de cette action une fois produits sont fort durables. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	L'affirmation pure et simple, dégagée de tout raisonnement et de toute preuve, est un des plus sûrs moyens de faire pénétrer une idée dans l'esprit des foules. Plus l'affirmation est concise, plus elle est dépourvue de toute apparence de preuves et de démonstration, plus elle a d'autorité. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	L'affirmation n'a cependant d'influence réelle qu'à la condition d'être constamment répétée, et, le plus possible, dans les mêmes termes. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Cette puissance vient de ce que la chose répétée finit par s'incruster dans ces régions profondes de l'inconscient où s'élaborent les motifs de nos actions. Au bout de quelque temps, nous ne savons plus quel est l'auteur de l'assertion répétée, et nous finissons par y croire. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	L'affirmation et la répétition sont seules assez puissantes pour pouvoir se combattre. Lorsqu'une affirmation a été suffisamment répétée, et qu'il y a unanimité dans la répétition, comme cela est arrivé pour certaines entreprises financières célèbres assez riches pour acheter tous les concours, il se forme ce qu'on appelle un courant d'opinion et le puissant mécanisme de la contagion intervient. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Dans les foules, les idées, les sentiments, les émotions, les croyances possèdent un pouvoir contagieux aussi intense que celui des microbes. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	La contagion n'exige pas la présence simultanée d'individus sur un seul point; elle peut se faire à distance sous l'influence de certains événements qui orientent tous les esprits dans le même sens et leur donnent les caractères spéciaux aux foules, surtout quand les esprits sont préparés par les facteurs lointains que j'ai étudiés plus haut. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	L'imitation, à laquelle on a attribué tant d'influence dans les phénomènes sociaux, n'est en réalité qu'un simple effet de la contagion. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	À chaque époque il y a un petit nombre d'individualités qui impriment leur action et que la masse inconsciente imite. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	C'est pour la même raison que les Européens, avec tous les avantages de leur civilisation, ont une influence si insignifiante sur les peuples de l'Orient: ils en diffèrent trop. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	La contagion est si puissante qu'elle impose aux individus non seulement certaines opinions mais encore certaines façons de sentir. (Lebon, 1895) 
	•	C'est la contagion qui fait mépriser à une époque certaines œuvres, telles que le Tanhauser, par exemple, et qui, quelques années plus tard, les fait admirer par ceux-là mêmes qui les avaient dénigrées le plus. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	C'est surtout par le mécanisme de la contagion, jamais par celui du raisonnement, que se propagent les opinions et les croyances des foules. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Le mécanisme de la contagion est si puissant que, devant son action, l'intérêt personnel lui-même s'évanouit. Et c'est pourquoi toute opinion devenue populaire finit toujours par s'imposer avec une grande force aux couches sociales les plus élevées, quelque visible que puisse être l'absurdité de l'opinion triomphante. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	This notion was expressed succinctly in Bernays’s 1928 book, Propaganda. Trotter and Le Bon concluded that the group mind does not think in the strict sense of the word. In place of thought it has impulses, habits and emotions. In making up its mind, its first impulse is usually to follow the example of a trusted leader. This is one of the most firmly established principles of mass psychology. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)

	•	Ce qui contribue surtout à donner aux idées propagées par l'affirmation, la répétition et la contagion, une puissance très grande, c'est qu'elles finissent par acquérir le pouvoir mystérieux nommé prestige. (Lebon, 1895)
Crowd differenciation
	•	To Mr. Martin the crowd is rather a state of mind, “the peculiar mental condition which sometimes occurs when people think and act together, either immediately where the members of the group are present and in close contact, or remotely, as when people think as when they affect one another in a certain way through the medium of an organization, a party or sect, the press, etc.” (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	Mr. Martin pictures society as an aggregation of people who have sacrificed individual freedom in order to remain within the group. This sacrifice of freedom on the part of individuals in the group leads its members to resist all efforts at fundamental changes in the group code. Because all have made certain sacrifices, reasons are developed why such sacrifices must be insisted upon at all times. The “logic-proof” compartment is the result of this unwillingness to accept changes. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	Each group, therefore, within itself, considers its own standards ultimate and indisputable, and tends to dismiss all contrary or different standards as indefensible.
	•	The main satisfaction, Mr. Martin thinks, which the individual derives from his group association is the satisfaction of his vanity through the creation of an enlarged self-importance. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
Crowd experience
	•	L'expérience constitue à peu près le seul procédé efficace pour établir solidement une vérité dans l'âme des foules, et détruire des illusions devenues trop dangereuses. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Leur seule utilité est de prouver à quel point les expériences doivent être répétées d'âge en âge pour exercer quelque influence, et réussir à ébranler seulement une erreur lorsqu'elle est solidement implantée dans l'âme des foules. (Lebon, 1895)
Crowd imagination
	•	l'imagination représentative des foules est très puissante, très active, et susceptible d'être vivement impressionnée. Les images évoquées dans leur esprit par un personnage, un événement, un accident, ont presque la vivacité des choses réelles. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	ce sont toujours les côtés merveilleux et légendaires des événements qui frappent le plus les foules. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Dans l'histoire, l'apparence a toujours joué un rôle beaucoup plus important que la réalité. L'irréel y prédomine toujours sur le réel. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Les foules, ne pouvant penser que par images, ne se laissent impressionner que par des images. Seules les images les terrifient ou les séduisent, et deviennent des mobiles d'action. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	les représentations théâtrales, qui donnent l'image sous sa forme la plus nettement visible, ont-elles toujours une énorme influence sur les foules. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Rien ne frappe davantage l'imagination des foules de toutes catégories que les représentations théâtrales. Toute la salle éprouve en même temps les mêmes émotions, et si ces émotions ne se transforment pas aussitôt en actes, c'est que le spectateur le plus inconscient ne peut ignorer qu'il est victime d'illusions, et qu'il a ri ou pleuré à d'imaginaires aventures. Parfois cependant les sentiments suggérés par les images sont si forts qu'ils tendent, comme les suggestions habituelles, à se transformer en actes. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	C'est sur l'imagination populaire qu'est fondée la puissance des conquérants et la force des États. C'est surtout en agissant sur elle qu'on entraîne les foules. Tous les grands faits historiques, la création du Bouddhisme, du Christianisme, de l'Islamisme, la Réforme, la Révolution, et, de nos jours, l'invasion menaçante du Socialisme, sont les conséquences directes ou lointaines d'impressions fortes produites sur l'imagination des foules. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	tous les grands hommes d'État de tous les âges et de tous les pays, y compris les plus absolus despotes, ont-ils considéré l'imagination populaire comme la base de leur puissance, et jamais ils n'ont essayé de gouverner contre elle. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Tout ce qui frappe l'imagination des foules se présente sous forme d'une image saisissante et bien nette, dégagée de toute interprétation accessoire, ou n'ayant d'autre accompagnement que quelques faits merveilleux ou mystérieux: une grande victoire, un grand miracle, un grand crime, un grand espoir. Il faut présenter les choses en bloc, et ne jamais en indiquer la genèse. Cent petits crimes ou cent petits accidents ne frapperont pas du tout l'imagination des foules; tandis qu'un seul grand crime, un seul grand accident les frapperont profondément, même avec des résultats infiniment moins meurtriers que les cent petits accidents réunis. (Lebon, 1895) 
	•	L'épidémie d'influenza qui, il y a peu d'années, fit périr, à Paris seulement, 5.000 personnes en quelques semaines, frappa très peu l'imagination populaire. Cette véritable hécatombe ne se traduisait pas, en effet, par quelque image visible, mais seulement par les indications hebdomadaires de la statistique. Un accident qui, au lieu de ces 5.000 personnes, en eût seulement fait périr 500, mais le même jour, sur une place publique, par un accident bien visible, la chute de la tour Eiffel, par exemple, eût au contraire produit sur l'imagination une impression immense. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Ce ne sont donc pas les faits en eux-mêmes qui frappent l'imagination populaire, mais bien la façon dont ils sont répartis et présentés. Il faut que par leur condensation, si je puis m'exprimer ainsi, ils produisent une image saisissante qui remplisse et obsède l'esprit. Qui connaît l'art d'impressionner l'imagination des foules connaît aussi l'art de les gouverner. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	ce ne sont pas les institutions qui agissent alors, puisque nous savons que, triomphantes ou vaincues, elles ne possèdent par elles-mêmes aucune vertu. Ce qui a agi sur l'âme des foules, ce sont des illusions et des mots. Des mots surtout, ces mots chimériques et puissants dont nous montrerons bientôt l'étonnant empire. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	La puissance des mots est liée aux images qu'ils évoquent et est indépendante de leur sens réel.—Ces images varient d'âge en âge, de race en race. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	En étudiant l'imagination des foules, nous avons vu qu'elle est impressionnée surtout par des images. Ces images, on n'en dispose pas toujours, mais il est possible de les évoquer par l'emploi judicieux des mots et des formules. Maniés avec art, ils possèdent vraiment la puissance mystérieuse que leur attribuaient jadis les adeptes de la magie. Ils font naître dans l'âme des foules les plus formidables tempêtes, et savent aussi les calmer. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	La puissance des mots est liée aux images qu'ils évoquent et tout à fait indépendante de leur signification réelle. Ce sont parfois ceux dont le sens est le plus mal défini qui possèdent le plus d'action. Tels par exemple, les termes: démocratie, socialisme, égalité, liberté, etc., dont le sens est si vague que de gros volumes ne suffisent pas à le préciser. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Ils synthétisent les aspirations inconscientes les plus diverses et l'espoir de leur réalisation.  (Lebon, 1895)
	•	La raison et les arguments ne sauraient lutter contre certains mots et certaines formules. On les prononce avec recueillement devant les foules; et, dès qu'ils ont été prononcés, les visages deviennent respectueux et les fronts s'inclinent. Beaucoup les considèrent comme des forces de la nature, des puissances surnaturelles. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Les images évoquées par les mots étant indépendantes de leur sens, varient d'âge en âge, de peuple à peuple, sous l'identité des formules. À certains mots s'attachent transitoirement certaines images: le mot n'est que le bouton d'appel qui les fait apparaître. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Si l'on considère une langue déterminée, on voit que les mots dont elle se compose changent assez lentement dans le cours des âges; (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Que faisons-nous, en réalité, quand nous substituons un terme français à un terme latin, grec ou sanscrit, ou même quand nous cherchons à comprendre un livre écrit dans notre propre langue il y a deux ou trois siècles? Nous substituons simplement les images et les idées que la vie moderne a mises dans notre intelligence, aux notions et aux images absolument différentes que la vie ancienne avait fait naître dans l'âme de races soumises à des conditions d'existence sans analogie avec les nôtres. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Les mots n'ont donc que des significations mobiles et transitoires, changeantes d'âge en âge et de peuple à peuple; et, quand nous voulons agir par eux, sur la foule, ce qu'il faut savoir, c'est le sens qu'ils ont pour elle à un moment donné, et non celui qu'ils eurent jadis ou qu'ils peuvent avoir pour des individus de constitution mentale différente. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	La puissance des mots est si grande qu'il suffit de désigner par des termes bien choisis les choses les plus odieuses pour les faire accepter des foules. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Une des fonctions les plus essentielles des hommes d'État consiste donc à baptiser de mots populaires, ou au moins neutres, les choses que les foules ne peuvent supporter avec leurs anciens noms. La puissance des mots est si grande qu'il suffit de désigner par des termes bien choisis les choses les plus odieuses pour les faire accepter des foules. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	L'art des gouvernants, comme celui des avocats, consiste surtout à savoir manier les mots. Une des grandes difficultés de cet art est que, dans une même société, les mêmes mots ont le plus souvent des sens fort différents pour les diverses couches sociales. Elles emploient en apparence les mêmes mots; mais elles ne parlent jamais la même langue. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	les foules ont toujours subi l'influence des illusions. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Qui sait les illusionner est aisément leur maître; qui tente de les désillusionner est toujours leur victime. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Si nous voulons comprendre les idées, les croyances qui y germent aujourd'hui, et qui écloront demain, il faut savoir comment le terrain a été préparé. (Lebon, 1895)

	•	Dans les foules, les idées, les sentiments, les émotions, les croyances possèdent un pouvoir contagieux aussi intense que celui des microbes. (Lebon, 1895)
Crowd interest
	•	Les foules ont rarement pour guide l'intérêt qui est, le plus souvent, le mobile exclusif de l'individu isolé. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Seules les collectivités sont capables de grands désintéressements et de grands dévouements. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	L'intérêt personnel est bien rarement un mobile puissant chez les foules, alors qu'il est le mobile à peu près exclusif de l'individu isolé. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Cette moralisation de l'individu par la foule n'est certes pas une règle constante, mais c'est une règle qui s'observe fréquemment. Elle s'observe même dans des circonstances beaucoup moins graves que celles que je viens de citer. J'ai déjà dit qu'au théâtre la foule veut chez le héros de la pièce des vertus exagérées, et il est d'une observation banale qu'une assistance, même composée d'éléments inférieurs, se montre généralement très prude. (Lebon, 1895)
Crowd mentality
	•	This series of lectures pivots on the contention that modern American society sets and essential conflict between the individual and the mass. The development of a philosophy of naturalism depersonaliwing man’s relationships to his world, of industrialism depersonalizing his relations to his fellows and to his work, of a continuous religious organization of the state, and of a standaediwede mass society to the detreiment of a differentiated class society – all this development has indusced an emergence of “crowd-mindedness” before which individuality suffers in its formation. The crowd mentality, marked characteristically by obsessive an delusive ideas, egonomia, and homicidal wishes, is an expression of infantilism; individuality, formed out of self-discipline, and indication of personal maturity. The book is an elaboration of these elementary propositions. The author feels sincerely the need for emancipating individuals from the mass or crowd, yet his suggestions for this liberation reduce to a few platitudes exhorting the life of self-discipline. Herbert Mlumer
	•	ce n'est pas dans les institutions qu'il faut chercher le moyen d'agir profondément sur l'âme des foules. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Les peuples sont gouvernés par leur caractère, et toutes les institutions qui ne sont pas intimement moulées sur ce caractère ne représentent qu'un vêtement d'emprunt, un déguisement transitoire. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	ce ne sont pas les institutions qui agissent alors, puisque nous savons que, triomphantes ou vaincues, elles ne possèdent par elles-mêmes aucune vertu. Ce qui a agi sur l'âme des foules, ce sont des illusions et des mots. Des mots surtout, ces mots chimériques et puissants dont nous montrerons bientôt l'étonnant empire. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	The crowd is a state of mind which permeates society and its individuals at almost all times. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
Crowd moral
	•	La moralité des foules peut, suivant les suggestions, être beaucoup plus basse ou beaucoup plus haute que celle des individus qui les composent. (Lebon, 1895)
Crowd opinion
	•	Dans les problèmes sociaux, comme dans les problèmes biologiques, un des plus énergiques facteurs est le temps. Il est le seul vrai créateur et le seul grand destructeur. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	l'influence du temps dans la genèse des opinions des foules. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	C'est le temps surtout qui prépare les opinions et les croyances des foules, ou tout au moins le terrain sur lequel elles germeront. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Le temps est donc notre véritable maître, et il suffit de le laisser agir pourvoir toutes choses se transformer. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Si nous voulons comprendre les idées, les croyances qui y germent aujourd'hui, et qui écloront demain, il faut savoir comment le terrain a été préparé. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Il était donc nécessaire de montrer comment le système actuel l'a façonnée, et comment la masse des indifférents et des neutres est devenue progressivement une immense armée de mécontents, prête à obéir à toutes les suggestions des utopistes et des rhéteurs. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Le propre du prestige est d'empêcher de voir les choses telles qu'elles sont et de paralyser tous nos jugements. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Les foules toujours, les individus le plus souvent, ont besoin, sur tous les sujets, d'opinions toutes faites. Le succès de ces opinions est indépendant de la part de vérité ou d'erreur qu'elles contiennent; il dépend uniquement de leur prestige. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Ce n'est pas le nom donné aux opinions, ni des adaptations trompeuses qui changent le fond des choses. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Tous ceux contraires aux croyances générales et aux sentiments de la race n'ont qu'une durée éphémère, et le fleuve détourné reprend bientôt son cours. Les opinions qui ne se rattachent à aucune croyance générale, à aucun sentiment de la race, et qui, par conséquent, ne sauraient avoir de fixité, sont à la merci de tous les hasards ou, si l'on préfère, des moindres changements de milieu. Formées par suggestion et contagion, elles sont toujours momentanées; elles naissent et disparaissent parfois aussi rapidement que les dunes de sable formées par le vent au bord de la mer. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	De nos jours, la somme des opinions mobiles des foules est plus grande qu'elle ne le fut jamais; et cela, pour trois raisons différentes: La première est que les anciennes croyances perdant de plus en plus leur empire, n'agissent plus comme jadis sur les opinions passagères pour leur donner une certaine orientation. L'effacement des croyances générales laisse place à une foule d'opinions particulières sans passé ni avenir. La seconde raison est que la puissance des foules devenant de plus en plus grande et ayant de moins en moins de contrepoids, la mobilité extrême d'idées que nous avons constatée chez elles, peut se manifester librement. La troisième raison enfin est la diffusion récente de la presse qui met sans cesse sous les yeux des foules les opinions les plus contraires. Les suggestions que chacune d'elles pourrait engendrer sont bientôt détruites par des suggestions opposées. Il en résulte que chaque opinion n'arrive pas à s'étendre et est vouée à une existence très éphémère. Elle est morte avant d'avoir pu se répandre assez pour devenir générale. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	l'impuissance des gouvernements à diriger l'opinion. Jadis, et ce jadis n'est pas fort loin, l'action des gouvernements, l'influence de quelques écrivains et d'un tout petit nombre de journaux constituaient les vrais régulateurs de l'opinion. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	L'opinion des foules tend donc à devenir de plus en plus le régulateur suprême de la politique. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	L'opinion des foules tend donc à devenir de plus en plus le régulateur suprême de la politique. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	la presse, autrefois directrice de l'opinion, elle a dû, comme les gouvernements, s'effacer devant le pouvoir des foules. Elle possède certes une puissance considérable, mais seulement parce qu'elle est exclusivement le reflet des opinions des foules et de leurs incessantes variations. Devenue simple agence d'information, elle a renoncé à chercher à imposer aucune idée, aucune doctrine. Elle suit tous les changements de la pensée publique, et les nécessités de la concurrence l'obligent à bien les suivre sous peine de perdre ses lecteurs. (Lebon, 1895)

	•	Où serait aujourd'hui le journal assez riche pour permettre à ses rédacteurs des opinions personnelles, et de quel poids seraient ces opinions auprès de lecteurs qui ne demandent qu'à être renseignés ou amusés, et qui, derrière chaque recommandation, redoutent toujours le spéculateur. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Les foules ont des opinions imposées, jamais des opinions raisonnées. (Lebon, 1895)
Crowd psychology
	•	Au point de vue psychologique, l'expression foule prend une signification tout autre. Dans certaines circonstances données, et seulement dans ces circonstances, une agglomération d'hommes possède des caractères nouveaux fort différents de ceux des individus composant cette agglomération. La personnalité consciente s'évanouit, les sentiments et les idées de toutes les unités sont orientés dans une même direction. Il se forme une âme collective, transitoire sans doute, mais présentant des caractères très nets. La collectivité est alors devenue ce que, faute d'une expression meilleure, j'appellerai une foule organisée, ou, si l'on préfère, une foule psychologique. Elle forme un seul être et se trouve soumise à la loi de l'unité mentale des foules. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Mille individus accidentellement réunis sur une place publique sans aucun but déterminé, ne constituent nullement une foule au point de vue psychologique. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Pour en acquérir les caractères spéciaux, il faut l'influence de certains excitants dont nous aurons à déterminer la nature. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Des milliers d'individus séparés peuvent à certains moments, sous l'influence de certaines émotions violentes, un grand événement national par exemple, acquérir les caractères d'une foule psychologique. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Lorsqu'une foule psychologique est constituée, elle acquiert des caractères généraux provisoires, mais déterminables. À ces caractères généraux s'ajoutent des caractères particuliers, variables, suivant les éléments dont la foule se compose et qui peuvent en modifier la constitution mentale. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Les foules psychologiques sont donc susceptibles d'une classification. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Il n'est pas facile de décrire avec exactitude l'âme des foules, parce que son organisation varie non seulement suivant la race et la composition des collectivités, mais encore suivant la nature et le degré des excitants auxquels ces collectivités sont soumises. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Seule l'uniformité des milieux crée l'uniformité apparente des caractères. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	ils possèdent une sorte d'âme collective qui les fait sentir, penser, et agir d'une façon tout à fait différente de celle dont sentirait, penserait et agirait chacun d'eux isolément. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Il est facile de constater combien l'individu en foule diffère de l'individu isolé; mais il est moins facile de découvrir les causes de cette différence. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	La plupart de nos actions journalières ne sont que l'effet de mobiles cachés qui nous échappent. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Dans l'âme collective, les aptitudes intellectuelles des individus, et par conséquent leur individualité, s'effacent. L'hétérogène se noie dans l'homogène, et les qualités inconscientes dominent. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Les décisions d'intérêt général prises par une assemblée d'hommes distingués, mais de spécialités différentes, ne sont pas sensiblement supérieures aux décisions que prendrait une réunion d'imbéciles. Ils ne peuvent mettre en commun en effet que ces qualités médiocres que tout le monde possède. Dans les foules, c'est la bêtise et non l'esprit, qui s'accumule. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	La première est que l'individu en foule acquiert, par le fait seul du nombre, un sentiment de puissance invincible qui lui permet de céder à des instincts que, seul, il eût forcément refrénés. Il sera d'autant moins porté à les refréner que, la foule étant anonyme, et par conséquent irresponsable, le sentiment de la responsabilité, qui retient toujours les individus, disparaît entièrement. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Dans une foule, tout sentiment, tout acte est contagieux, et contagieux à ce point que l'individu sacrifie très facilement son intérêt personnel à l'intérêt collectif.
	•	détermine dans les individus en foule des caractères spéciaux parfois tout à fait contraires à ceux de l'individu isolé. Je veux parler de la suggestibilité, dont la contagion mentionnée plus haut n'est d'ailleurs qu'un effet. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	La vie du cerveau étant paralysée chez le sujet hypnotisé, celui-ci devient l'esclave de toutes les activités inconscientes de sa moelle épinière, que l'hypnotiseur dirige à son gré. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Tel est à peu près aussi l'état de l'individu faisant partie d'une foule psychologique. Il n'est plus conscient de ses actes. Chez lui, comme chez l'hypnotisé, en même temps que certaines facultés sont détruites, d'autres peuvent être amenées à un degré d'exaltation extrême. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Sous l'influence d'une suggestion, il se lancera avec une irrésistible impétuosité à l'accomplissement de certains actes. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Donc, évanouissement de la personnalité consciente, prédominance de la personnalité inconsciente, orientation par voie de suggestion et de contagion des sentiments et des idées dans un même sens, tendance à transformer immédiatement en actes les idées suggérées, tels sont les principaux caractères de l'individu en foule. Il n'est plus lui-même, il est devenu un automate que sa volonté ne guide plus. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	par le fait seul qu'il fait partie d'une foule organisée, l'homme descend de plusieurs degrés sur l'échelle de la civilisation. Isolé, c'était peut-être un individu cultivé, en foule c'est un barbare, c'est-à-dire un instinctif. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	L'individu en foule est un grain de sable au milieu d'autres grains de sable que le vent soulève à son gré. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	renoncer à leur inviolabilité et à se décimer eux-mêmes. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	la foule est toujours intellectuellement inférieure à l'homme isolé, mais que, au point de vue des sentiments et des actes que ces sentiments provoquent, elle peut, suivant les circonstances, être meilleure ou pire. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Tout dépend de la façon dont la foule est suggestionnée. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	La foule est le jouet de toutes les excitations extérieures et en reflète les incessantes variations.—Les impulsions auxquelles elle obéit sont assez impérieuses pour que l'intérêt personnel s'efface.—Rien n'est prémédité chez les foules.—Action (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Leur obéissance aux suggestions.—Les images évoquées dans leur esprit sont prises par elles pour des réalités.—Pourquoi (Lebon, 1895)
	•	parmi les caractères spéciaux des foules, il en est plusieurs, tels que l'impulsivité, l'irritabilité, l'incapacité de raisonner, l'absence de jugement et d'esprit critique, l'exagération des sentiments, et d'autres encore, que l'on observe également chez les êtres appartenant à des formes inférieures d'évolution. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	La foule, avons-nous dit en étudiant ses caractères fondamentaux, est conduite presque exclusivement par l'inconscient. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Les actes exécutés peuvent être parfaits quant à leur exécution, mais, le cerveau ne les dirigeant pas, l'individu agit suivant les hasards des excitations. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Une foule est le jouet de toutes les excitations extérieures et en reflète les incessantes variations. Elle est donc esclave des impulsions qu'elle reçoit. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	l'individu isolé possède l'aptitude à dominer ses réflexes, alors que la foule ne la possède pas. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	si les foules veulent les choses avec frénésie, elles ne les veulent pas bien longtemps. Elles sont aussi incapables de volonté durable que de pensée. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	La foule n'est pas seulement impulsive et mobile. Comme le sauvage, elle n'admet pas que quelque chose puisse s'interposer entre son désir et la réalisation de ce désir. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Pour l'individu en foule, la notion d'impossibilité disparaît. L'individu isolé sent bien qu'il ne pourrait à lui seul incendier un palais, piller un magasin, et, s'il en est tenté, il résistera aisément à sa tentation. Faisant partie d'une foule, il a conscience du pouvoir que lui donne le nombre, et il suffit de lui suggérer des idées de meurtre et de pillage pour qu'il cède immédiatement à la tentation. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	l'état normal de la foule contrariée est la fureur. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Toutes les foules sont toujours irritables et impulsives, sans doute, mais avec de grandes variations de degré. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Si neutre qu'on la suppose, la foule se trouve le plus souvent dans cet état d'attention expectante qui rend la suggestion facile. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	errant toujours sur les limites de l'inconscience, subissant aisément toutes les suggestions, ayant toute la violence de sentiments propre aux êtres qui ne peuvent faire appel aux influences de la raison, dépourvue de tout esprit critique, la foule ne peut qu'être d'une crédulité excessive. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	La création des légendes qui circulent si aisément dans les foules n'est pas déterminée seulement par une crédulité complète. Elle l'est encore par les déformations prodigieuses que subissent les événements dans l'imagination de gens assemblés. L'événement le plus simple vu par la foule est bientôt un événement transformé. Elle pense par images, et l'image évoquée en évoque elle-même une série d'autres n'ayant aucun lien logique avec la première. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	La raison nous montre ce que dans ces images il y a d'incohérence, mais la foule ne le voit guère; et ce que son imagination déformante ajoute à l'événement réel, elle le confondra avec lui. La foule ne sépare guère le subjectif de l'objectif. Elle admet comme réelles les images évoquées dans son esprit, et qui le plus souvent n'ont qu'une parenté lointaine avec le fait observé. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Dans cet exemple on voit se dérouler bien clairement le mécanisme de l'hallucination collective tel que nous l'avons expliqué. D'un côté, une foule en état d'attention expectante; de l'autre, une suggestion faite par la vigie signalant un bâtiment désemparé en mer, suggestion qui, par voie de contagion, fut acceptée par tous les assistants, officiers ou matelots. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Dès que quelques individus sont réunis, ils constituent une foule, et, alors même qu'ils seraient des savants distingués, ils prennent tous les caractères des foules pour ce qui est en dehors de leur spécialité. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	le point de départ de la suggestion est toujours l'illusion produite chez un individu par des réminiscences plus ou moins vagues, puis la contagion par voie d'affirmation de cette illusion primitive. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Ce que l'observateur voit alors, ce n'est plus l'objet lui-même, mais l'image évoquée dans son esprit. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	observations collectives sont les plus erronées de toutes et que le plus souvent elles représentent simplement l'illusion d'un individu qui, par voie de contagion, a suggestionné les autres. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Connaissons-nous un seul mot de vrai concernant la vie des grands hommes qui ont joué les rôles prépondérants dans l'humanité, tels que Hercule, Bouddha, Jésus ou Mahomet? Très probablement non. Au fond d'ailleurs, leur vie réelle nous importe fort peu. Ce que nous avons intérêt à connaître, ce sont les grands hommes tels que la légende populaire les a fabriqués. Ce sont les héros légendaires, et pas du tout les héros réels, qui ont impressionné l'âme des foules. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Il n'est même pas besoin que les siècles aient passé sur les héros pour que leur légende soit transformée par l'imagination des foules. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Sous les Bourbons, Napoléon devint une sorte de personnage idyllique philanthrope et libéral, ami des humbles, qui, au dire des poètes, devaient conserver son souvenir sous le chaume pendant bien longtemps. Trente ans après, le héros débonnaire était devenu un despote sanguinaire qui, après avoir usurpé le pouvoir et la liberté, fit périr trois millions d'hommes uniquement pour satisfaire son ambition. De nos jours, nous assistons à une nouvelle transformation de la légende. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	l'histoire ne peut guère éterniser que des mythes. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Il y a des phénomènes sociaux qu'il faut étudier en psychologue beaucoup plus qu'en naturaliste. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	“Crowds have always undergone the influence of illusions,” he wrote, “Whoever can supply them with illusions is easily their master. Whoever attempts to destroy their illusions is always their victim.” For Le Bon, to exert control over the social order in a democratic age a “small intellectual aristocracy,” adept in the application of mass psychology, was essential. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	This notion was expressed succinctly in Bernays’s 1928 book, Propaganda. Trotter and Le Bon concluded that the group mind does not think in the strict sense of the word. In place of thought it has impulses, habits and emotions. In making up its mind, its first impulse is usually to follow the example of a trusted leader. This is one of the most firmly established principles of mass psychology. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	Mr. Martin calls crowd psychology and crowd activity “the result of forces hidden in a personal and unconscious psyche of the members of the crowd, forces which are merely released by social gatherings of a certain sort.” The crowd enables the individual to express himself according to his desire and without restraint. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	“Every crowd ‘boosts for’ itself, gives itself airs, speaks with oracular finality, regards itself as morally superior, and will, so far as it has the power, lord it over every one. Notice how each group and section in society, so far as it permits itself to think as crowd, claims to be ‘the people.’”  (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	“The crowd unconsciously identifies its members with one or the other competitor. Success enables the winning crowd to ‘crow over’ the losers. Such an action becomes symbolical, and is utilized by the ego to enhance its feeling of importance. In society this egoism tends to take the form of the desire for dominance. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	In the first place, Mr. Martin points out with absolute justice that the crowd-mind is by no means limited to the ignorant. “Any class,” he says, “may behave and think as a crowd—in fact, it usually does so in so far as its class interests are concerned.” Neither is the crowd mind to be found only when there is a physical agglomeration of people. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	Everybody read “Main Street.” Each reader in his own study tried to react as a crowd-mind. They felt as they thought they ought to. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	The crowd is a state of mind which permeates society and its individuals at almost all times. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	What becomes articulate in times of stress under great excitement is present in the mind of the individual at most times and explains in part why popular opinion is so positive and so intolerant of contrary points of view. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
Crowd reasonning
	•	les arguments qu'elles emploient et ceux qui peuvent agir sur elles sont, au point de vue logique, d'un ordre tellement inférieur que c'est seulement par voie d'analogie qu'on peut les qualifier de raisonnements. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Les raisonnements inférieurs des foules sont, comme les raisonnements élevés, basés sur des associations; mais les idées associées par les foules n'ont entre elles que des liens apparents d'analogie ou de succession. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Association de choses dissemblables, n'ayant entre elles que des rapports apparents, et généralisation immédiate de cas particuliers, telles sont les caractéristiques des raisonnements des foules. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Une chaîne de raisonnements logiques est totalement incompréhensible aux foules, et c'est pourquoi il est permis de dire qu'elles ne raisonnent pas ou raisonnent faux, et ne sont pas influençables par un raisonnement. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	L'orateur, en communication intime avec la foule, sait évoquer les images qui la séduisent. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	l'impuissance des foules à raisonner juste les empêche d'avoir aucune trace d'esprit critique, c'est-à-dire d'être aptes à discerner la vérité de l'erreur, à porter un jugement précis sur quoi que ce soit. Les jugements que les foules acceptent ne sont que des jugements imposés et jamais des jugements discutés. À ce point de vue, nombreux sont les hommes qui ne s'élèvent pas au-dessus de la foule. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	La facilité avec laquelle certaines opinions deviennent générales tient surtout à l'impossibilité où sont la plupart des hommes de se former une opinion particulière basée sur leurs propres raisonnements. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Nous avons montré que les foules ne raisonnent pas; qu'elles admettent ou rejettent les idées en bloc; ne supportent ni discussion, ni contradiction, et que les suggestions agissant sur elles envahissent entièrement le champ de leur entendement et tendent aussitôt à se transformer en actes. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	les foules convenablement suggestionnées sont prêtes à se sacrifier pour l'idéal qui leur a été suggéré. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Si nous voulons comprendre les idées, les croyances qui y germent aujourd'hui, et qui écloront demain, il faut savoir comment le terrain a été préparé. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Il était donc nécessaire de montrer comment le système actuel l'a façonnée, et comment la masse des indifférents et des neutres est devenue progressivement une immense armée de mécontents, prête à obéir à toutes les suggestions des utopistes et des rhéteurs. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	La puissance des mots est liée aux images qu'ils évoquent et est indépendante de leur sens réel.—Ces images varient d'âge en âge, de race en race. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Dans l'énumération des facteurs capables d'impressionner l'âme des foules, on pourrait se dispenser entièrement de mentionner la raison, s'il n'était nécessaire d'indiquer la valeur négative de son influence. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Les lois de la logique n'ont aucune action sur elles 15. Pour convaincre les foules, il faut d'abord se rendre bien compte des sentiments dont elles sont animées, feindre de les partager, puis tenter de les modifier, en provoquant, au moyen d'associations rudimentaires, certaines images bien suggestives; savoir revenir au besoin sur ses pas, deviner surtout à chaque instant les sentiments qu'on fait naître. Cette nécessité de varier sans cesse son langage suivant l'effet produit à l'instant où l'on parle frappe d'avance d'impuissance tout discours étudié et préparé: l'orateur y suit sa pensée, car non celle de ses auditeurs, et, par ce seul fait, son influence devient parfaitement nulle. 
	•	Les esprits logiques, habitués à être convaincus par des chaînes de raisonnements un peu serrées, ne peuvent s'empêcher d'avoir recours à ce mode de persuasion quand ils s'adressent aux foules, et le manque d'effet de leurs arguments les surprend toujours. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Qu'on essaie de convaincre par un raisonnement des esprits primitifs, des sauvages ou des enfants, par exemple, et l'on se rendra compte de la faible valeur que possède ce mode d'argumentation. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Chaque race porte dans sa constitution mentale les lois de ses destinées, et c'est peut-être à ces lois qu'elle obéit par un inéluctable instinct, même dans ses impulsions en apparence les plus irraisonnées. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Si l'on ne considérait que ces faits isolés l'histoire semblerait régie par d'invraisemblables hasards. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Laissons donc la raison aux philosophes, mais ne lui demandons pas trop d'intervenir dans le gouvernement des hommes. Ce n'est pas avec la raison et c'est le plus souvent malgré elle, que se sont créés des sentiments tels que l'honneur, l'abnégation, la foi religieuse, l'amour de la gloire et de la patrie, qui ont été jusqu'ici les grands ressorts de toutes les civilisations. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Dans l'énumération des facteurs capables d'impressionner l'âme des foules, on pourrait se dispenser entièrement de mentionner la raison, s'il n'était nécessaire d'indiquer la valeur négative de son influence. (Lebon, 1895)

This is one of the most firmly established principles of mass psychology. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
Crowd religiousity
	•	Ce sentiment a des caractéristiques très simples: adoration d'un être supposé supérieur, crainte de la puissance magique qu'on lui suppose, soumission aveugle à ses commandements, impossibilité de discuter ses dogmes, désir de les répandre, tendance à considérer comme ennemis tous ceux qui ne les admettent pas. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	On n'est pas religieux seulement quand on adore une divinité, mais quand on met toutes les ressources de l'esprit, toutes les soumissions de la volonté, toutes les ardeurs du fanatisme au service d'une cause ou d'un être qui devient le but et le guide des pensées et des actions. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	L'intolérance et le fanatisme constituent l'accompagnement nécessaire d'un sentiment religieux. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Les Jacobins de la Terreur étaient aussi foncièrement religieux que les catholiques de l'Inquisition, et leur cruelle ardeur dérivait de la même source. Les convictions des foules revêtent ces caractères de soumission aveugle, d'intolérance farouche, de besoin de propagande violente qui sont inhérents au sentiment religieux; et c'est pourquoi on peut dire que toutes leurs croyances ont une forme religieuse. Le héros que la foule acclame est véritablement un dieu pour elle. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Tous les fondateurs de croyances religieuses ou politiques ne les ont fondées que parce qu'ils ont su imposer aux foules ces sentiments de fanatisme qui font que l'homme trouve son bonheur dans l'adoration et l'obéissance et est prêt à donner sa vie pour son idole. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	S'ils obéissaient, c'est que l'empereur, qui personnifiait la grandeur romaine, était adoré comme une divinité, du consentement unanime. Dans la moindre bourgade de l'Empire, l'empereur avait ses autels. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Aujourd'hui la plupart des grands conquérants d'âmes n'ont plus d'autels, mais ils ont des statues ou des images, et le culte qu'on leur rend n'est pas notablement différent de celui qu'on leur rendait jadis. On n'arrive à comprendre un peu la philosophie de l'histoire que quand on est bien pénétré de ce point fondamental de la psychologie des foules. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	il faut une religion aux foules, puisque toutes les croyances politiques, divines et sociales ne s'établissent chez elles qu'à la condition de revêtir toujours la forme religieuse, qui les met à l'abri de la discussion. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	L'objet de ses croyances religieuses s'était transformé, mais ses sentiments religieux, peut-on dire vraiment qu'ils avaient changé? (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Il y a des phénomènes sociaux qu'il faut étudier en psychologue beaucoup plus qu'en naturaliste. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	La Réforme, la Saint-Barthélemy, les guerres de Religion, l'Inquisition, la Terreur, sont des phénomènes d'ordre identique, accomplis par des foules animées de ces sentiments religieux qui conduisent nécessairement à extirper sans pitié, par le fer et le feu, tout ce qui s'oppose à l'établissement de la nouvelle croyance. (Lebon, 1895)
Crowd soul
	•	L'âme de la race représente l'état de civilisation et l'âme de la foule l'état de barbarie. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	la race, et nous avons montré qu'elle est le plus puissant des facteurs capables de déterminer les actions des hommes. Elle manifeste également son action dans les caractères des foules. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Les profondes divergences que la constitution mentale héréditaire crée dans la façon de sentir et de penser des hommes, éclatent immédiatement dès que des circonstances, assez rares d'ailleurs, réunissent dans une même foule, en proportions à peu près égales, des individus de nationalités différentes, quelque identiques que soient en apparence les intérêts qui les rassemblent. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	L'âme de la race domine donc entièrement l'âme de la foule. Elle est le substratum puissant qui limite ses oscillations. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	L'état de foule et la domination des foules, c'est la barbarie ou le retour à la barbarie. C'est en acquérant une âme solidement constituée que la race se soustrait de plus en plus à la puissance irréfléchie des foules et sort de la barbarie. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Et c'est ainsi qu'une fois encore nous retombons sur cette notion fondamentale de race, déjà rencontrée si souvent, et sur cette autre notion, qui découle de la première que les institutions et les gouvernements ne jouent qu'un rôle insignifiant dans la vie des peuples. Ces derniers sont surtout conduits par l'âme de leur race, c'est-à-dire par les résidus ancestraux dont cette âme est la somme. La race et l'engrenage des nécessités de chaque jour, tels sont les maîtres mystérieux qui régissent nos destinées. (Lebon, 1895)
Crowd typology
	•	 la simple multitude. Sa forme la plus inférieure se présente, lorsqu'elle est composée d'individus appartenant à des races différentes. Elle n'a d'autre lien commun que la volonté, plus ou moins respectée d'un chef. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	se trouvent celles qui, sous l'influence de certains facteurs, ont acquis des caractères communs et ont fini par former une race. Elles présenteront à l'occasion les caractéristiques spéciales des foules, mais ces caractéristiques seront plus ou moins dominées par celles de la race. (Lebon, 1895)
Crowd violence
	•	Les témoins sont unanimes. Tous ceux qui ont assisté aux manifestations de violence de la foule en attestent : l’horreur est la règle. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	C’est à croire que lorsque la foule s’assemble, pour peu que la passion s’en mêle et qu’un meneur l’excite, elle se met en quête d’un exécutoire sur lequel décharger ses tensions. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	C’est probablement ce qui explique que Sighele et Le Bon, effrayés, n’aient pas hésité à criminaliser la foule. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Ce qui est frappant, ainsi que le souligne J. Stoetzel (op. cit., p. 265), une fois dépassée l’horreur de ces récits, c’est le caractère quasi rituel de ces violences. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Traitant plus précisément des lynchages, l’auteur en décrit, à la suite de Miller et Dollar, deux formes. L’une « bien ordonnée », lynchage « bourbonien » selon les spécialistes, est accomplie par des gens riches dont le but est de « châtier le coupable ». L’autre, désordonnée, est commise par les défavorisés, agissant sous le coup de leur émotion et frappant au hasard. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	le fait que, produits apparemment spontanés et accidentels des circonstances, ils obéissent à une sorte de protocole, tant dans leur inspiration, liée à la situation socio-économique du moment (période critique, malaise), que dans leur déroulement et ses conséquences, plus ou moins culturellement déterminées. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	« qu’elles ne correspondent pas à des poussées instinctives mais semblent sociologiquement contingentées, ont un sens et une fonction sociologiques, et ne résultent pas de poussées aveugles de l’instinct ». (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	les rôles dans un groupe de lyncheurs, par conséquent les conduites affectives individuelles, varient avec la position sociale du sujet et son niveau de culture. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Ce sont les enthousiasmes collectifs. Apparaissant sous l’influence de facteurs psychodéterminants, à des moments de grande réceptivité du public, ces faits semblent caractérisés par la mobilisation émotionnelle générale aboutissant à une action de masse. Dans un premier temps on sensibilise les individus, puis on polarise leur attention sur le but que l’on s’est fixé. Une fois atteint le niveau émotionnel souhaité, on s’emploie à ne pas le laisser trop vite retomber. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Qu’un contradicteur, par exemple, se manifeste dans ces moments de passion où l’intensité émotionnelle atteint parfois son comble, il sera perçu comme l’ennemi qu’il faut abattre. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	on peut dire qu’ils répondent aux grands paroxysms émotionnels. On y trouve toutes les expressions comportementales de la peur e de la colère développées à l’extrême. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	ce qui est remarquable et constant est la prevalence d’un état passionnel. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Pour Durkheim, ces manigestations d’effervescence sont à l’origine du sentiment religieux et le constituent. Et il est exact qu’elles sont souvent associées à des fêtes religieuses et s’intègrent à des rites don’t l’exécution passe par ells. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	La Réforme, la Saint-Barthélemy, les guerres de Religion, l'Inquisition, la Terreur, sont des phénomènes d'ordre identique, accomplis par des foules animées de ces sentiments religieux qui conduisent nécessairement à extirper sans pitié, par le fer et le feu, tout ce qui s'oppose à l'établissement de la nouvelle croyance. (Lebon, 1895)

Electoral crowd
	•	Les foules électorales, c'est-à-dire les collectivités appelées à élire les titulaires de certaines fonctions, constituent des foules hétérogènes; mais, comme elles n'agissent que sur un point bien déterminé: choisir entre divers candidats, on ne peut observer chez elles que quelques-uns des caractères précédemment décrits. Les caractères des foules qu'elles manifestent surtout, sont la faible aptitude au raisonnement, l'absence d'esprit critique, l'irritabilité, la crédulité et le simplisme. On découvre aussi dans leurs décisions l'influence des meneurs et le rôle des facteurs que nous avons énumérés: l'affirmation, la répétition, le prestige et la contagion. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	La première des conditions à posséder pour le candidat est le prestige. Le prestige personnel ne peut être remplacé que par celui de la fortune. Le talent, le génie même ne sont pas des éléments bien sérieux de succès. Cette nécessité pour le candidat de posséder du prestige, c'est-à-dire de pouvoir s'imposer sans discussion, est capitale. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	la possession du prestige ne suffit pas pour assurer au candidat le succès. L'électeur tient à ce qu'on flatte ses convoitises et ses vanités; il faut l'accabler des plus extravagantes flagorneries, ne pas hésiter à lui faire les plus fantastiques promesses. S'il est ouvrier, on ne saurait trop injurier et flétrir ses patrons. Quant au candidat adverse, il faut tâcher de l'écraser en établissant par affirmation, répétition et contagion qu'il est le dernier des gredins, et que personne n'ignore qu'il a commis plusieurs crimes. Inutile, bien entendu, de chercher aucun semblant de preuve. Si l'adversaire connaît mal la psychologie des foules, il essaiera de se justifier par des arguments, au lieu de se borner à répondre aux affirmations par d'autres affirmations; et il n'aura dès lors aucune chance de triompher. Le programme écrit du candidat ne doit pas être trop catégorique, parce que ses adversaires pourraient le lui opposer plus tard, mais son programme verbal ne saurait être trop excessif. Les réformes les plus considérables peuvent être promises sans crainte. Sur le moment, ces exagérations produisent beaucoup d'effet, et pour l'avenir elles n'engagent en rien. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Le programme écrit du candidat ne doit pas être trop catégorique, parce que ses adversaires pourraient le lui opposer plus tard, mais son programme verbal ne saurait être trop excessif. Les réformes les plus considérables peuvent être promises sans crainte. Sur le moment, ces exagérations produisent beaucoup d'effet, et pour l'avenir elles n'engagent en rien. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Nous reconnaissons ici tous les facteurs de persuasion que nous avons décrits. Nous allons les retrouver encore dans l'action des mots et des formules dont nous avons déjà montré le magique empire. L'orateur qui sait les manier conduit à volonté les foules où il veut. Des expressions telles que l'infâme capital, les vils exploiteurs, l'admirable ouvrier, la socialisation des richesses, etc., produisent toujours le même effet, bien qu'un peu usés déjà. Mais le candidat qui trouve une formule neuve, bien dépourvue de sens précis, et par conséquent pouvant répondre aux aspirations les plus diverses, obtient un succès infaillible. La sanglante révolution espagnole de 1873 a été faite avec un de ces mots magiques, au sens complexe, que chacun peut interpréter à sa façon. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Quant à l'influence que pourraient avoir des raisonnements sur l'esprit des électeurs, il faudrait n'avoir jamais lu le compte rendu d'une réunion électorale pour n'être pas fixé à ce sujet. On y échange des affirmations, des invectives, parfois des horions, jamais des raisons. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Les foules ont des opinions imposées, jamais des opinions raisonnées. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Telle est la psychologie des foules électorales. Elle est identique à celle des autres foules. Ni meilleure ni pire. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Sans doute encore les suffrages des foules sont souvent bien dangereux. Ils nous ont déjà coûté plusieurs invasions; et, avec le triomphe du socialisme, qu'ils préparent, il est probable que les fantaisies de la souveraineté populaire nous coûteront beaucoup plus cher encore. (Lebon, 1895)
Heterogeneous crowd
	•	foule hétérogène, c'est-à-dire composée d'éléments dissemblables, présente avec les foules homogènes, c'est-à-dire composées d'éléments plus ou moins semblables (sectes, castes et classes), des caractères communs, et, à côté de ces caractères communs, des particularités qui permettent de l'en différencier. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Elles se composent d'individus quelconques, quelle que soit leur profession ou leur intelligence. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	par le fait seul que des hommes forment une foule agissante, leur psychologie collective diffère essentiellement de leur psychologie individuelle, et que l'intelligence ne les soustrait pas à cette différenciation. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	dans les collectivités, l'intelligence ne joue aucun rôle. Seuls des sentiments inconscients agissent. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	la seule classification importante à faire pour les foules hétérogènes est de les séparer en foules anonymes, comme celles des rues, et en foules non anonymes,—les assemblées délibérantes et les jurés par exemple. Le sentiment de la responsabilité, nul chez les premières et développé chez les secondes, donne à leurs actes des orientations souvent fort différentes. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Populations have increased. In this country geographical areas have increased. Heterogeneity has also increased. A group living in any given area is now extremely likely to have no common ancestry, no common tradition, as such, and no cohesive intelligence. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	the difficulty of creating a common will on any subject because it has heightened the natural tendency of men to separate into crowds opposed to one another in point of view. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	The physical difficulties of communication make group separation greater. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
Homogenous crowd
	•	La secte marque le premier degré dans l'organisation des foules homogènes. Elle comprend des individus d'éducation, de professions, de milieux parfois fort différents, n'ayant entre eux que le lien unique des croyances. Telles sont les sectes religieuses et politiques, par exemple. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	La caste représente le plus haut degré d'organisation dont la foule soit susceptible. Alors que la secte comprend des individus de professions, d'éducation, de milieux fort différents et rattachés seulement par la communauté des croyances, la caste ne comprend que des individus de même profession et par conséquent d'éducation et de milieux à peu près semblables. Telles sont la caste militaire et la caste sacerdotale, par exemple. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	La classe est formée par des individus d'origines diverses réunis, non par la communauté des croyances, comme le sont les membres d'une secte, ni par la communauté des occupations professionnelles, comme le sont les membres d'une caste, mais par certains intérêts, certaines habitudes de vie et d'éducation fort semblables. Telles sont, par exemple, la classe bourgeoise, la classe agricole, etc. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	The tendency the group has to standardize the habits of individuals and to assign logical reasons for them is an important factor in the work of the public relations counsel. The predominant point of view, according to Mr. Trotter, which translates a rationalized point of view into an axiomatic truth, arises and derives its strength from the fact that it enlists herd support for the point of view of the individual. This explains why it is so easy to popularize many ideas. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	“The cardinal quality of the herd is the homogeneity.”3 The biological significance of homogeneity lies in its survival value. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	These results of homogeneity have created the “herd” point of view. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	One of the psychological results of homogeneity is the fact that physical loneliness is a real terror to the gregarious animal, and that association with the herd causes a feeling of security. In man this fear of loneliness creates a desire for identification with the herd in matters of opinion. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	Each one of us in his opinions and his conduct, in matters of amusement, religion, and politics, is compelled to obtain the support of a class, of a herd within the herd.” (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	“The effect of it will clearly be to make acceptable those suggestions which come from the herd, and those only. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	Absolute homogeneity, resulting in a dead level of uniformity in public and individual reaction, is undesirable. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
Lonely crowd
	•	The technology is based on isolation, and the technical process isolates in turn. From the automobile to television, all the goods selected by the spectacular system are also its weapons for a constant reinforcement of the conditions of isolation of “lonely crowds.” (Debord, 2012)
Pasive crowd
	•	les foules passives qu’il appelle audiences. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Des milliers d'individus séparés peuvent à certains moments, sous l'influence de certaines émotions violentes, un grand événement national par exemple, acquérir les caractères d'une foule psychologique. (Lebon, 1895)
Parliamentary crowd
	•	Les foules parlementaires sont très suggestibles; et, comme pour toutes les foules, la suggestion émane de meneurs possédant du prestige; mais, dans les assemblées parlementaires, la suggestibilité a des limites très nettes qu'il importe de marquer. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	à chaque législature, une Chambre a des opinions très fixes et d'autres opinions très indécises. Au fond, les questions générales étant les plus nombreuses, c'est l'indécision qui domine, indécision entretenue par la crainte constante de l'électeur, dont la suggestion latente tend toujours à contre-balancer l'influence des meneurs. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Ce sont cependant les meneurs qui sont en définitive les vrais maîtres dans les discussions nombreuses où les membres d'une assemblée n'ont pas d'opinions antérieures bien arrêtées. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	La nécessité de ces meneurs est évidente puisque, sous le nom de chefs de groupes, on les retrouve dans les assemblées de tous les pays. Ils sont les vrais souverains d'une assemblée. Les hommes en foule ne sauraient se passer d'un maître. Et c'est pourquoi les votes d'une assemblée ne représentent généralement que les opinions d'une petite minorité. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Les meneurs agissent très peu par leurs raisonnements, beaucoup par leur prestige. Et la meilleure preuve, c'est que si une circonstance quelconque les en dépouille, ils n'ont plus d'influence. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Ce prestige des meneurs est individuel et ne tient ni au nom ni à la célébrité. (Lebon, 1895)
Revolutionary crowd
	•	Les instincts révolutionnaires momentanés des foules ne les empêchent pas d'être extrêmement conservatrices.—Elles sont d'instinct hostiles aux changements et au progrès. (Lebon, 1895)
Coalition
Willing collation
	•	Coalitions of the willing are tactical by definition because their ultimate objective is not to ‘win’ wars, but police the wild frontiers of a globalized world. (Coker, 2009)
Coat of arms
	•	Pour qui sait le déchiffrer, le blason est une algèbre, le blason est une langue. L'histoire entière de la seconde moitié du moyen âge est écrite dans le blason, comme l'histoire de la première moitié dans le symbolisme des églises romanes. Ce sont les hiéroglyphes de la féodalité après ceux de la théocratie. (Hugo and Chamarat, 1998)
Cognition 
	•	Cognition generally refers to a broad set of mental capacities that are involved in acquiring knowledge, perception, attention, memory, judgment, and decision making. (van der Linden, 2016)
Cognitive-appraisal theories 
	•	From cognitive-appraisal theories we borrow the idea that a range of cognitive dimensions (rather than just valence) usefully differentiates emotional experience and effects. (Lerner and Keltner, 2000)
Cognitive availability
	•	People do not need to experience the event directly to become anchored in it, as long as the experience is available to them in some captivating way, such as visual images of the events or personally related, emotionally delivered verbal accounts by those who experienced it. More immersive or experiential media, such as movies and video games, increase the effect. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	The cognitive availability of the event produces effects similar to direct experience of the event. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Cognitive availability can mislead the audience. People are more likely to recall risks associated with striking images or experiences than risks that are less cognitively available (even if they are objectively higher). (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Cognitive availability determines what we perceive. (McCain, 1992)
	•	According to this heuristic principle, one basis for the judgement of the likelihood of an uncertain outcome is cognitive availability; that is, the ease with which this outcome can be pictured or constructed. (Gilovich et al., 2002)
Cognitive busyness
	•	People who are cognitively busy are also more likely to make selfish choices, use sexist language, and make superficial judgments in social situations. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	Cognitive busyness can disrupt the spontaneous activation of stereotypes. (Kunda, 1999)
	•	Cognitive busyness inhibits stereotype activation but, once a stereotype has been activated, cognitive busyness facilitates stereotype application. (Kite and Whitley, 2016)
	•	Cognitive busyness can use up mental resources that could otherwise be used to search for individuating information, thereby prevening stereotype inhibition and facilitation stereotype application. (Whitley and Kite, 2010)
	•	Cognitive busyness affected only perceptions of a member of a stereotyped group, not perceptions of people in general. (Whitley and Kite, 2010)
	•	A state of mind where one’s present cognitive resources are taken up by (‘busy with’) some ongoing mental activity. (Brown, 2011)
	•	Amen  ! dit Caderousse en faisant un signe d'adieu à Danglars et en se dirigeant vers les allées de Meilhan, tout en secouant la tête et en se parlant à lui-même, comme ont l'habitude de faire les gens fort préoccupés. (Dumas, 1998)
Cognitive diversity 
	•	New issues demand cognitive diversity – different ways of looking at things. (Stilgoe et al., 2006)
Cognitive dissonance
	•	But both groups, once their minds are made up, are likely to resist taking on board information that appears to undermine the basis on which their decisions were taken. This problem of cognitive dissonance is well documented in military circles too. (Omand, 2014)
Cognitive ease
	•	One of the dials measures cognitive ease, and its range is between “Easy” and “Strained.” Easy is a sign that things are going well—no threats, no major news, no need to redirect attention or mobilize effort. Strained indicates that a problem exists, which will require increased mobilization of System 2. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	a single dial of cognitive ease is connected to a large network of diverse inputs and outputs. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	Hearing a speaker when you are in a good mood, or even when you have a pencil stuck crosswise in your mouth to make you “smile,” also induces cognitive ease. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	The various causes of ease or strain have interchangeable effects (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	cognitive ease, you are probably in a good mood, like what you see, believe what you hear, trust your intuitions, and feel that the current situation is comfortably familiar. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	If you cannot remember the source of a statement, and have no way to relate it to other things you know, you have no option but to go with the sense of cognitive ease. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	The consequences of repeated exposures benefit the organism in its relations to the immediate animate and inanimate environment. They allow the organism to distinguish objects and habitats that are safe from those that are not, and they are the most primitive basis of social attachments. Therefore, they form the basis for social organization and cohesion—the basic sources of psychological and social stability. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	A sense of cognitive ease is apparently generated by a very faint signal from the associative machine, which “knows” that the three words are coherent (share an association) long before the association is retrieved. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	The role of cognitive ease in the judgment was confirmed experimentally by another German team: manipulations that increase cognitive ease (priming, a clear font, pre-exposing words) all increase the tendency to see the words as linked. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	cognitive ease, and the intuition of coherence is, as scientists say, correlational but not necessarily causal. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	Good mood and cognitive ease are the human equivalents of assessments of safety and familiarity (Kahneman, 2012)
Cognitive evaluation of risk
	•	Cognitive evaluations of risk are sensitive to the variables identified by decision theory, namely probabilities and outcome valences. (Loewenstein et al., 2001)
Cognitive illusion
	•	Cognitive illusions can be more stubborn than visual illusions. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	the illusions of validity and skill are supported by a powerful professional culture (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	Given the professional culture of the financial community, it is not surprising that large numbers of individuals in that world believe themselves to be among the chosen few who can do what they believe others cannot. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	Television and radio stations and newspapers have their panels of experts whose job it is to comment on the recent past and foretell the future. Viewers and readers have the impression that they are receiving information that is somehow privileged, or at least extremely insightful. And there is no doubt that the pundits and their promoters genuinely believe they are offering such information. (Kahneman, 2012)
Cognitive limitation
	•	A substantial body of research in cognitive psychology and decisionmaking is based on the premise that these cognitive limitations cause people to employ various simplifying strategies and rules of thumb to ease the burden of mentally processing information to make judgments and decisions. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	These simple rules of thumb are often useful in helping us deal with complexity and ambiguity. Under many circumstances, however, they lead to predictably faulty judgments known as cognitive biases. (Heuer, 1999)
Cognitive strain
	•	you experience cognitive strain when you read instructions in a poor font, or in faint colors, or worded in complicated language, or when you are in a bad mood, and even when you frown. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	When you feel strained, you are more likely to be vigilant and suspicious, invest more effort in what you are doing, feel less comfortable, and make fewer errors, but you also are less intuitive and less creative than usual. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	the experience of cognitive strain, whatever its source, tends to mobilize System 2, shifting people’s approach to problems from a casual intuitive mode to a more engaged and analytic mode. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	the same self-reinforcing reciprocity is found in studies of cognitive ease. On the one hand, cognitive strain is experienced when the effortful operations of System 2 are engaged. (Kahneman, 2012) 
	•	Cognitive strain, whatever its source, mobilizes System 2, which is more likely to reject the intuitive answer suggested by System 1. (Kahneman, 2012)
Coherence
	•	One bias attributable to the search for coherence is a tendency to favor causal explanations. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Coherence implies order, so people naturally arrange observations into regular patterns and relationships. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	If no pattern is apparent, our first thought is that we lack understanding, not that we are dealing with random phenomena that have no purpose or reason. (Heuer, 1999)

Judgments of coherence
	•	Judgments of coherence may be influ- enced by many extraneous factors, and if analysts tend to favor certain types of explanations as more coherent than others, they will be biased in favor of those explanations. (Heuer, 1999)
Commemoration
	•	L’exaltation eut effectivement déboucher sur la violence : on assiste alors à des manifestations sado-masochistes à caractère mystique (processions de flagellants, amputations délibérément consenties et vouées à la divinité) ou politique. Des révoltes éclatent en embrasements soudains et sauvages (émeutes, jacqueries, soulèvements accompagnés de meurtres, d’atrocités diverses, de pillages). (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Les célébrations et commémorations, tout en relevant par certains côtés de la fête, sont, en général, plus modérées dans leur expression. Leur but fondamental, consécration solennelle d’un souvenir ou exercice liturgique, reste centré sur l’action communautaire. A travers ces procédures renouvelées de glorification du passé où chacun reconnaît ses racines, la société se révèle à elle-même tandis qu’elle exerce ses offices. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Les cérémonies sont, en effet, des conduites collectives hautement ritualisées, s’exprimant d’une manière fixe, suivant une ordonnance réglée qui donne sa stabilité au fait cérémoniel. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	fonction essentielle de stabiliser la vie sociale dans son ensemble en proposant des repères de temps et de lieux, mais aussi des modèles de comportements aux membres de la société. La cérémonie, quelle qu’elle soit (mariage, épreuve initiatique, enterrement), est l’un des principaux véhicules de la conformité sociale et l’on peut même dire qu’en la matière l’exigence de conformité tend à être maximale : le groupe attend activement que chacun participe à un système défini de valeurs religieuses, éthiques ou politiques. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	La fonction psychosociale de la cérémonie est donc évidente : agissant dans le sens d’un conventionnalisme étroit, elle aboutit à un renforcement de la cohérence intragroupale. En un mot, la cérémonie rassemble autant qu’elle célèbre. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	L’adaptation sociale passe donc par l’abandon d’une importante partie des désirs personnels. (Mannoni, 1985)
Commodity
	•	commodity appears in fact as a power which comes to occupy social life. It is then that political economy takes shape, as the dominant science and the science of domination. (Debord, 2012)
Commodity fetishism
	•	This is the principle of commodity fetishism, the domination of society by “intangible as well as tangible things,” which reaches its absolute fulfillment in the spectacle, where the tangible world is replaced by a selection of images which exist above it, and which simultaneously impose themselves as the tangible par excellence. (Debord, 2012)
Common law
	•	Common law thus provides two risk management functions—compensation and deterrence. (Covello and Mumpower, 1986)
Common mechanism of toxicity
	•	common mechanism of toxicity as "two or more pesticide chemicals or other substances that cause a common toxic effect to human health by the same, or essentially the same, sequence of major biochemical events" (page 4). (Williams and Paustenbach, 2002)
Common-mode accident
	•	The environment alone can constitute a source of failure that is common for many components—a common-mode accident. (Perrow, 1999)
Common-mode function 
	•	“common-mode” function—it services two other components, and if it fails, both of those "modes" (heating the tank, cooling the reactor) fail. This begins to get more complex. (Perrow, 1999)
Common-mode failures
	•	Common-mode failures are just one indication of interactiveness in systems. (Perrow, 1999)
Community
	•	Community is created by shared meanings, and communication is not only an expression of social order, but is also its foundation. (Hutton, 1998)
	•	A multi-celled organism, anything from a small nematode to a large primate, consists of specialized cells organized into a variety of communities.  (Holland, 2014)
	•	The definition of community as subgraph ‘more densely connected internally than externally’ is very general, but fails to capture some special modules. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
	•	Mesure et répétition sont les couleurs dont se pare habituellement l’univers frileux des communautés. Tout y est stable, réglé. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	La stabilité, la continuité permettent à la masse de vivre son idéal de pérennité. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	une rupture tiendrait aux deux systèmes à la fois, l’ancien auquel elle sert de clôture et le prochain dont elle est déjà le moment initial. Transitoire par nature, elle serait l’un des principaux moteurs du dynamisme social, forçant sous sa loi les cités et les empires qu’elle ébranle profondément dans leurs structures traditionnelles. (Mannoni, 1985)
Community network
	•	networks try to explain how a set of isolated elements are transformed, through a pattern of interactions, into groups and communities. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
Nested communities 
	•	Nested communities are possible: for example, regional identities within national identities. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
Real worl community
	•	real-worl communities are much more complex than dense clusters. Several partitions are possible at the same time; nationality, social class, gender, job, political ideas: all could classify the same set of people. Moreover, communities can overlap: an individual can belong to multiple nationalities or affiliations at the same time. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
Community of danger
	•	In Risk Society, Beck points to the existence of ‘communities of danger’ that ultimately can only be comprised in the United Nations. (Rasmussen, 2001)
Community studies 
	•	Community studies are more strongly influenced by the ethnographic model. The studies, which are usually conducted on small (or relatively small) social communities located in specific areas, oblige the researcher to live for a certain period of time in the community studied. (Corbetta, 2003)
Company
	•	Companies, by contrast, often do find themselves competing for survival, especially when consumer demand collapses either because the goods they produce fall out of fashion or because they are rendered obsolete by technological change. (Coker, 2009)
	•	Companies often go out of business. Countries rarely do. Yet, that does not mean, of course, that they do not compete. (Coker, 2009)
Comparative analysis
	•	Comparative analysis is probably most useful in raising questions about things we would otherwise take for granted and casting them in a different light. (Dillon, 1988)
Competition
	•	Maximizing competition limits specialization. (Betts, 2007)
Competing Values Approach
	•	In the CVA framework, two basic value dimensions combine to define perspectives on effective decision making processes. The first value dimension is related to process structure; an emphasis on flexibility competes with an emphasis on control. The second value dimension is related to the focus of the process; an emphasis on the desires of those directly affected (internal focus) competes with an emphasis on the needs of the broader public (external focus). The relative emphasis on these competing values defmes four distinct perspectives of effective decision making: the rational perspective (high control, external focus), the empirical perspective (high control, internal focus), the consensual perspective (high flexibility, internal focus), and the political perspective (high flexibility, external focus). (Vari, 1995)
Competitive organization
	•	In competitive organizations there are people who, having no goods or services to exchange, get driven out of the market. (Rayner and Cantor, 1987)
	•	Policymakers in competitive-individualist organizations will favor a loss-spreading approach to liability, in which market mechanisms determine who bears losses. When pure market solutions are not available, institutions of this sort will attempt to reproduce what the market would have done if it had not been impeded by high information and/or trans- action costs. (Rayner and Cantor, 1987)
Competitive-individualist risk takers
	•	Competitive-individualist risk takers will prefer to invest their confidence in successful individuals to most effectively manage risk. (Rayner and Cantor, 1987)
Compliance profession
	•	“the compliance professions,” those groups and often clandestine organizations that exist to manufacture public thought, opinion and behavior on behalf of political and corporate clients. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	“Crowds have always undergone the influence of illusions,” he wrote, “Whoever can supply them with illusions is easily their master. Whoever attempts to destroy their illusions is always their victim.” For Le Bon, to exert control over the social order in a democratic age a “small intellectual aristocracy,” adept in the application of mass psychology, was essential. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
Complexity
	•	In science complexity is considered a cost, which must be justified by a sufficiently rich set of new and (preferably) interesting predictions of facts that the existing theory cannot explain.  (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	Complexity refers to the difficulty of identifying and quantifying causal links between a multitude of potential causal agents and specific observed effects. (Renn, 2007b)
	•	Complexity is particularly pertinent in the phase of estimation with respect to hazards as well as risks. (Renn, 2007b)
	•	Complexity did not spell this out − instead, it forced societies to be more creative. (Coker, 2009)
	•	Complexity inheres not in externalities (politics: forging a New Jerusalem or a socialist utopia); it inheres in internalities (how people think and feel and perceive the world and themselves). (Coker, 2009)
	•	‘[…] complexity arises because you have a great many of these simple components interacting simultaneously. But complexity is actually in the organisation − the myriad possible ways that the components can interact’ (King 2000:132). (Coker, 2009)
	•	with complexity comes an increased likelihood of breakdown under stress. (Omand, 2014)
	•	complexity increases geometrically. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	If any single factor comes to mind when navigating the morass of difficulty factors (Figure 1), it is complexity. Cognition adapts to complexity, through processes such as problem detection and sensemaking (Klein et al. 2003, 2006a,b,c). (Hoffman et al., 2011)
	•	Complexity, once an ordinary noun describing objects with many interconnected parts, now designates a scientific field with many branches. (Holland, 2014)
	•	Complicated and complex similarly defy any attempt to provide a sharp, distinguishing demarcation—it is easy to distinguish one from the other at the extremes but there is a middle-ground where the distinction becomes unclear and arbitrary. (Holland, 2014)
	•	complexity, like life and consciousness, does not have a rigorous definition. (Holland, 2014)
	•	As the field of complexity studies has developed, it has split into two subfields that examine two different kinds of emergence: the study of complex physical systems (CPS) and the study of complex adaptive systems (CAS): The study of complex physical systems focuses on geometric (often lattice-like) arrays of elements, in which interactions typically depend only on effects propagated from nearest neighbours. (Holland, 2014)
	•	self-organized systems (the modern science of complexity). (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
Complex adaptative system
	•	CAS studies, in contrast to CPS studies, concern themselves with elements that are not fixed. The elements, usually called agents, learn or adapt in response to interactions with other agents. (Holland, 2014)
	•	It is unusual for CAS agents to converge, even momentarily, to a single ‘optimal’ strategy, or to an equilibrium. As the agents adapt to each other, new agents with new strategies usually emerge. Then each new agent offers opportunities for still further interactions, increasing the overall complexity. (Holland, 2014)
	•	All CAS exhibit similar entanglements, each new agent offering possibilities for still other agents. The complex feedback loops that form make it difficult to analyse, or even describe, CAS. (Holland, 2014)
	•	the laws of CPS are almost always formulated using partial differential equations (PDEs in standard physics parlance), where the variables of the equations specify the states (e.g., position, momentum, and time in Newton’s equations). (Holland, 2014)
	•	In CAS the elements are adaptive agents, so the elements themselves change as the agents adapt. The analysis of such systems becomes much more difficult. In particular, the changing interactions between adaptive agents are not simply additive.). (Holland, 2014)
	•	The difficulty is compounded because in most disciplines involving CAS, such as the social sciences, there is no standard language for describing, let alone analysing, the interactions of agents. (Holland, 2014)
	•	To steer CAS we must go beyond collecting and organizing data to discover the mechanisms that generate the data, and to do that we require a precise language for describing the adaptive interactions of large numbers of agents. (Holland, 2014)
	•	Scaling is a property related to self-similarity, suggesting a new way to examine CPS and complexity in general. (Holland, 2014)
	•	Complex adaptive systems (CAS) are composed of elements, called agents, that learn or adapt in response to interactions with other agents.  (Holland, 2014)
	•	realistic agents change their strategies as they gain experience with the diverse actions of other traders—they adapt. (Holland, 2014)
	•	The difficulty presented by diversity is further compounded by the conditional nature of agent actions—the actions of a typical agent are conditionally dependent upon what other agents are doing. Said another way, the behaviour of the whole CAS is not obtained by summing the behaviours of the component agents or, using a familiar phrase, ‘the whole is more than the sum of the parts’. This non-linearity (non-additivity) poses particular difficulties for the mathematics used to study CPS because most of that mathematics (e.g., partial differential equations) is founded on an assumption of additivity, To add another difficulty still, the aggregate behaviour of a CAS—think of swarms of fish or flocks of birds—is rarely set by a central executive. (Holland, 2014)
	•	all well-studied CAS exhibit lever points, points where a small directed action causes large predictable changes in aggregate behaviour, as when a vaccine produces long-term changes in an immune system. At present, lever points are almost always located by trial and error. (Holland, 2014)
	•	All CAS agents, whatever their particularities, have three levels of activity: 1.   Performance (moment-by-moment capabilities) 2.   Credit-assignment (rating the usefulness of available capabilities) 3.   Rule-discovery (generating new capabilities). Performance designates an agent’s behavioural repertoire at a point in time, typically specified by a set of conditional IF/THEN rules. (Holland, 2014)
	•	To make an agent sensitive to its environment, it is provided with a set of detectors (sight, smell, and touch for example) that translate activities in the environment (say, the activities of other agents) into signals for internal processing. The agent can also modify the environment via a set of effectors (think of muscles) that translate the agent’s interior signals into actions that affect the environment. (Holland, 2014)
	•	An agent adapts by changing its signal-processing rules, with corresponding changes in the structure of the associated network. (Holland, 2014)
	•	Credit assignment.As an agent accumulates experience, it will find that some of its rules are rarely, or never, useful. (Holland, 2014)
	•	the rule’s strength is determined by its direct interactions with (1) the rules sending signals to it, and (2) the rules directly acting on its signals. (Holland, 2014)
	•	Rule discovery.When an agent treats rules as hypotheses that must be tested, then credit assignment amounts to a process of confirmation: strong rules are hypotheses that have been (partially) confirmed, while weak rules are hypotheses that have been disconfirmed. If an agent can replace weak rules with new rules that might plausibly be better, it can adapt at a much higher level. (Holland, 2014)
	•	It has been observed that innovation in CAS is mostly a matter of combining well-known components in new ways. (Holland, 2014)
	•	the behaviour of a CAS is always generated by the adaptive interactions of its components. (Holland, 2014)
	•	When studying complex adaptive systems (CAS) in a grammar-like way, agents serve as the ‘alphabet’. In agent-based terms, then, the hierarchical organization of CAS implies different kinds of agents at different levels, with correspondingly different grammars. (Holland, 2014)
	•	A multi-celled organism, anything from a small nematode to a large primate, consists of specialized cells organized into a variety of communities.  (Holland, 2014)
	•	Community-based organization extends both downward and upward from the level of organisms, giving rise to the hierarchies that characterize complex adaptive systems (CAS). (Holland, 2014)
	•	All CAS that have been examined closely exhibit trends toward increasing numbers of specialists. (Holland, 2014)
	•	In CAS agents, many rules and production lines are active simultaneously. (Holland, 2014)
	•	Co-evolution is one of the major mechanisms for generating non-linear interactions between complex adaptive systems (CAS) agents. ‘Arms races’, be they between countries or organisms, provide a simple example. (Holland, 2014)
	•	Analogous situations occur between competing suppliers for production lines, arms races between nations, and other sets of co-evolving CAS agents. (Holland, 2014)
	•	Feasible testing times account for the fact that hierarchical organization is a pervasive feature of all complex adaptive systems. (Holland, 2014)
	•	At this point, connections have been made between three different ways of presenting a niche: •    Networks provide a precise snapshot of the interactions of agents in a complex system at a given point in time •    The communities in these networks define existing niches within the complex system •    For each community there is a corresponding set of gated urns, and recombination of the tag-sensitive gate conditions provides a precise approach to co-evolutionary succession within the complex system. (Holland, 2014)
	•	Because the study of complex systems, and complex adaptative systems in particular, involves a variety of models and concepts, a framework that uses a common language to describe thses systems offers a substantial advantage in making comparisons. (Holland, 2014)
	•	All CAS consist of populations of adaptive, interacting agents. (Holland, 2014)
	•	Another important question is posed by one of the most obvious characteristics of CAS: diversity. How does a CAS retain its diversity inf face of continual pressures for adaptation and improvement? Partly, this diversity is the result of the extensive interactions between component agents. Because of continually varying context provided by other agents, it is difficult to define what an optimal agent could be, let alone show that it would ‘take over’ the system. (Holland, 2014)
	•	For CAS, it is important that the interpretation assigned to the generators should facilitate the interpretation of short string of generators as building blocks for higher levels of organization. (Holland, 2014)
Complex physical systems
	•	The study of complex physical systems focuses on geometric (often lattice-like) arrays of elements, in which interactions typically depend only on effects propagated from nearest neighbours. (Holland, 2014)
	•	Almost all CPS studies approach dynamics with a careful definition of state, but emergence complicates the analysis. (Holland, 2014)
	•	Symmetry-breaking also plays an important role in the development of multi-celled organisms and, indeed, in complex systems in general. (Holland, 2014)
Complex social phenomena
	•	complex social phenomena are often multidetermined (van der Linden, 2016)
Complex system
	•	A tropical rainforest provides a prime example of a complex system. The rainforest contains an almost endless variety of species—one can walk a hundred paces without seeing the same species of tree twice, and a single tree may host over a thousand distinct species of insects. (Holland, 2014)
	•	Many other systems important to humans exhibit similar complexities: markets with their varieties of buyers and sellers, organized into groups participating in mutual funds; economies with hierarchies of workers, departments, firms, and industries; multi-celled organisms consisting of proteins, membranes, organelles, cells, and organs; the Internet with users, stations, servers, and websites; to name a few. Each of these complex systems exhibits a distinctive property called emergence, roughly described by the common phrase ‘the action of the whole is more than the sum of the actions of the parts’. (Holland, 2014)
	•	complex systems will evolve from simple systems much more rapidly if there are stable intermediate forms. … The resulting complex forms … will be hierarchic. Among possible complex forms, hierarchies are the ones that have time to evolve. (Holland, 2014)
	•	Much of the motivation for treating a system as complex is to get at questions that would otherwise remain inaccessible. Often the first steps in acquiring a deeper understanding are through comparisons of similar systems. (Holland, 2014)
	•	By treating hierarchical organization as sine qua non for complexity we focus on the interactions of emergent properties at various levels. (Holland, 2014)
	•	Complex systems exhibit several kinds of telltale behaviour. I will describe some of these behaviours briefly here; they will be examined in more detail in later chapters. •   self-organization into patterns, as occurs with flocks of birds or schools of fish •   chaotic behaviour where small changes in initial conditions (‘the flapping of a butterfly’s wings in Argentina’) produce large later changes (‘a hurricane in the Caribbean’) •   ‘fat-tailed’ behaviour, where rare events (e.g. mass extinctions and market crashes) occur much more often than would be predicted by a normal (bell-curve) distribution •   adaptive interaction, where interacting agents (as in markets or the Prisoner’s Dilemma) modify their strategies in diverse ways as experience accumulates. In addition, as already mentioned, emergent behaviour is an essential requirement for calling a system ‘complex’. (Holland, 2014)
	•	Analysis of complex systems almost always turns on finding recurring patterns in the system’s ever-changing configurations. (Holland, 2014)
	•	complex systems typically exhibit recurring patterns that offer similar possibilities for ‘steering’. (Holland, 2014)
	•	Laws, like Newton’s laws of gravity or Maxwell’s laws of electromagnetism, are the counterpart of the rules of chess. States, such as the state of an economy, are the counterpart of particular configurations of pieces on the chessboard. As in chess, the laws determine the ways in which the states can change over time. In complex physical systems, laws constrain the way in which a given initial state can change. (Holland, 2014)
	•	Emergence is the primary characteristic that distinguishes complex systems as an important subset of complicated system.
	•	Emergence is tightly tied to the formation of boundaries. These boundaries can arise from symmetry breaking, as in Ising’s bar magnet model or Turing’s model of morphogenesis (Chapter 2), or they can arise by assembly of component building blocks, as in the assembly of semi-permeable membranes from proteins (Chapter 3). For CAS? The agent-defining boundaries determine the interactions between agents. Indeed the agent-defining boundaries act like semi-permeable membranes, admitting some signals and excluding others. Adaptation, and the emergence of new kinds of agents, then arises from changes in the relevant boundaries. (Holland, 2014)
Complex world
	•	In our complex world everything is interconnected. (Coker, 2009)
	•	Any phenomenon in the world is by nature complex. The people you deal with are equally complex. Any action sets off a limitless chain of reactions. It is never so simple as A leads to B. B will lead to C, to D, and beyond. Other actors will be pulled into the drama and it is hard to predict their motivations and responses. You cannot possibly map out these chains or get a complete handle on consequences. But by making your thinking more consequential you can at least become aware of the more obvious negative consequences that could ensue, and this often spells the difference between success and disaster. You want depth of thinking, to go to several degrees in imagining the permutations, as far as your mind can go. (Greene, 2018)
Component
Giant connected component
	•	In all networks, almost all the elements of the systems take part in one large connected structure, called a giant connected component. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
In-component 
	•	in-component the first is made up of pages with paths pointing to the giant strongly connected component, (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
Out-component 
	•	the second of nodes that receive links coming out from it. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
Computer
Digital computer 
	•	A digital computer is a finite state machine: there are only a limited number of bits inside it which define its current state. Encoded in the current state of the machine is the rule that determines which state comes next.  (Smith and Smith, 2007)
Computation
	•	You don’t have to believe everything you compute. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
Computational resources
	•	Our models, however, are not perfect and our computational resources are limited. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
Concerns
Individual concerns
	•	Individual concerns or how individuals see the risk from a particular hazard affecting them and things they value personally. This is not surprising since one of the most important questions for individuals incurring a risk is how it affects them, their family and things they value. Though they may be prepared to engage voluntarily in activities that often involve high risks, as a rule they are far less tolerant of risks imposed on them and over which they have little control, unless they consider the risks as negligible. Moreover, though they may be willing to live with a risk that they do not regard as negligible, if it secures them or society certain benefits, they would want such risks to be kept low and clearly controlled. (Great Britain and Health and Safety Executive, 2001)
	•	[…] for hazards that are familiar, often taken voluntarily for a benefit, and individual in their impact. These do not as a rule give rise to societal concerns. Nevertheless, activities giving rise to such hazards (for example, Bungee jumping) are often regulated to ensure that people are not needlessly put at risk. (Great Britain and Health and Safety Executive, 2001)
Societal concerns
	•	Societal concerns or the risks or threats from hazards which impact on society and which, if realised, could have adverse repercussions for the institutions responsible for putting in place the provisions and arrangements for protecting people, eg Parliament or the Government of the day. This type of concern is often associated with hazards that give rise to risks which, were they to materialise, could provoke a socio-political response, eg risk of events causing widespread or large scale detriment or the occurrence of multiple fatalities in a single event. Typical examples relate to nuclear power generation, railway travel, or the genetic modification of organisms. Societal concerns due to the occurrence of multiple fatalities in a single event is known as societal risk. Societal risk is therefore a subset of societal concerns. (Great Britain and Health and Safety Executive, 2001)
	•	Hazards giving rise to societal concerns share a number of common features. They often give rise to risks which could cause multiple fatalities; where it is difficult for people to estimate intuitively the actual threat; where exposure involves vulnerable groups, eg children; where the risks and benefits tend to be unevenly distributed – for example between groups of people with the result that some people bear more of the risks and others less, or through time so that less risk may be borne now and more by some future generation. People are more averse to those risks and in such cases are therefore more likely to insist on stringent Government regulation. (Great Britain and Health and Safety Executive, 2001)
	•	Developing criteria on tolerability of risks for hazards giving rise to societal concerns is difficult. Hazards giving rise to such concerns often involve a wide range of events with a range of possible outcomes. The summing or integration of such risks, or their mutual comparison, may call for the attribution of weighting factors for which, at present, no generally agreed values exist as, for example, the death of a child as opposed to an elderly person, dying from a dreaded cause, eg cancer, or the fear of affecting future generations in an irreversible way. (Great Britain and Health and Safety Executive, 2001)
	•	where societal concerns arise because of the risk of multiple fatalities occurring in one event from a single major industrial activity. (Great Britain and Health and Safety Executive, 2001)
	•	Societal concerns relate to harm to the wider community, damage to the social fabric caused by a loss of public trust in the regulatory system, and to the duty-holders creating and controlling the risk, should the risk materialize. (Bandle, 2007)
Concurrent evaluation methods 
	•	Concurrent evaluation methods study text comprehension concurrently. For example, think-aloud protocols ask subjects to verbalize any thoughts that come to their mind as they read text aloud. (Bostrom et al., 1994)
	•	Concurrent evaluations can also include physical measurements such as detailed eye movement protocols or response latencies for problem solving and informa- tion search in a communication. (Bostrom et al., 1994)
Confidence
	•	Confidence is a feeling, which reflects the coherence of the information and the cognitive ease of processing it. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	The etymology of confidence includes trust (confide), hope (confidence) and faith (fides). None of these inhere in the future. Instead, the words tend to remind us unnervingly of our losses − one of which is the faith in progress which James’s generation took for granted. (Coker, 2009)
	•	Confidence depends on routine, unlike trust which emerges out of actions which, in the case of a military operation, can put at risk soldiers’ lives. (Coker, 2009)
	•	Confidence is usually risk-averse. When standard operational procedures are found to be flawed confidence can be lost quite quickly. (Coker, 2009)
	•	If confidence, writes Schdmidtchen, depends on routine. (Coker, 2009)
	•	Confidence usually comes with a greater feeling of relaxation that is clearly reflected in the face, and with a greater freedom of movement. Those who are powerful will feel allowed to look around more at others, choosing to make eye contact with whomever they please. Their eyelids are more closed, a sign of seriousness and competence. If they feel bored or annoyed, they show it more freely and openly. They often smile less, frequent smiling being a sign of overall insecurity. They feel more entitled to touch people, such as with friendly pats on the back or on the arm. In a meeting, they will tend to take up more space and create more distance around themselves. They stand taller, and their gestures are relaxed and comfortable. Most important, others feel compelled to imitate their style and mannerisms. The leader will tend to impose a form of nonverbal communication on the group in very subtle ways. You will notice people mimicking not only their ideas but also their calm or more frenetic energy. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Alpha males like to signal their superior position in the rank in several ways: They speak faster than others and feel entitled to interrupt and control the flow of the conversation. Their handshake is extra vigorous, almost crushing. When they walk in the office, you will see them assume a taller stance and a purposeful stride, generally making inferiors walk behind them. Watch chimpanzees in a zoo and you will notice similar behavior on the part of the alpha chimp. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Confidence without Self-awareness and control can become grandiosity. Without conscious effort, these strengths will tend to wear down or turn into weaknesses. What this means is that the weakest parts of our character are the ones that create habits and compulsive behavior, because they do not require effort or practice to maintain. (Greene, 2018)
Confidence level
	•	This seems obvious to us now, but such an organic way of thinking has great application to our psychological health as well. Now more than ever people focus on their specific problems—their depression, their lack of motivation, their social inadequacies, their boredom. But what governs all of these seemingly separate problems is our attitude, how we view the world on a daily basis. It is how we see and interpret events. Improve the overall attitude and everything else will elevate as well—creative powers, the ability to handle stress, confidence levels, relationships with people. (Greene, 2018)
Fake confidence
	•	Fake confidence can be quite off-putting. (Greene, 2018)
Subjective confidence
	•	high subjective confidence is not to be trusted as an indicator of accuracy (low confidence could be more informative). (Kahneman, 2012)
Confidence rating
	•	The proper way to use ratings of confidence is to rely on the confident forecasts and ignore the unconfident forecasts (by whatever threshold you set between confidence and unconfidence). (Newsome, 2013)

Defree of confidence
	•	Once the need to present alternative hypotheses is accepted, the next step is to estimate the relative probability of each—or if the alternative hypothesis is not well defined, one’s degree of confidence that one’s preferred interpretation is correct. (Weiss, 2008)

Confidentiality
	•	Confidentiality could also allow a flexible policy response without protracted discussions should new information emerge. (Stilgoe et al., 2006)
Confirmation bias
	•	We all su er from problems, for example, like “con rmation bias,” the natural tendency only to accept evidence that con rms what we already believe. (Nichols, 2017)
	•	We all have personal experiences, prejudices, fears, and even phobias that prevent us from accepting expert advice. (Nichols, 2017)
Conflict of interest
	•	Financial conflict of interest inevitably shapes judgment—the funding effect—and this correlation must be factored into the consideration of the analyses and opinions of scientists employed by industry. (Michaels, 2008)
Conflict resolution
	•	Resolution of conflicts necessarily reflect the relatively political power of competing interest. (Nelkin, 1992)
Conjunction
	•	conjunctions leads to overestimation (Tversky and Kahneman, 1974)
Connector
Superconnector
	•	Superconnectors are present in many kinds of network, not only in social ones. Some routers in the Internet have thousands of connections: that is, thousands more than the average router, which has just a few links. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
Consequences
	•	When people lose the connection between their actions and their consequences, they lose their hold on reality, and the further this goes the more it looks like madness. (Greene, 2018)
Consequence management
	•	Consequence management sounds much like mitigation. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	The Canadian government defines consequence management as “the coordination and implementation of measures and activities undertaken to alleviate the damage, loss, hardship, and suffering caused by an emergency. Note [that] consequence management also includes measures to restore essential government services, protect public health, and provide emergency relief to affected governments, businesses, and populations” (Public Safety Canada, 2012, p. 17). (Newsome, 2013)
	•	The British Civil Contingencies Secretariat defines consequence management as the “measures taken to protect public health and safety, restore essential services, and provide emergency relief to governments, businesses, and individuals affected by the impacts of an emergency” (U.K. Cabinet Office, 2013). (Newsome, 2013)
	•	When people lose the connection between their actions and their consequences, they lose their hold on reality, and the further this goes the more it looks like madness. (Greene, 2018)
Consequential thinking
	•	Any phenomenon in the world is by nature complex. The people you deal with are equally complex. Any action sets off a limitless chain of reactions. It is never so simple as A leads to B. B will lead to C, to D, and beyond. Other actors will be pulled into the drama and it is hard to predict their motivations and responses. You cannot possibly map out these chains or get a complete handle on consequences. But by making your thinking more consequential you can at least become aware of the more obvious negative consequences that could ensue, and this often spells the difference between success and disaster. You want depth of thinking, to go to several degrees in imagining the permutations, as far as your mind can go. (Greene, 2018)
Unintended consequences 
	•	History is littered with endless examples of this phenomenon. (Greene, 2018)
	•	The source of this age-old syndrome is relatively simple: alarmed by something in the present, we grab for a solution without thinking deeply about the context, the roots of the problem, the possible unintended consequences that might ensue. Because we mostly react instead of think, our actions are based on insufficient information. (Greene, 2018)
	•	When we operate with such a skewed perspective, it results in all kinds of perverse effects. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Invariably in these cases people’s thinking is remarkably simple and lazy: kill Caesar and the Republic returns, action A leads to result B. A variation on this, one that is quite common in the modern world, is to believe that if people have good intentions, good things should be the result. If a politician is honest and means well, he or she will bring about the desired results. In fact, good intentions often lead to what are known as cobra effects, because people with the noblest intentions are often blinded by feelings of self-righteousness and do not consider the complex and often malevolent motivations of others. (Greene, 2018)
Conservation-of-resources (COR) 
	•	The COR approach is based on the proposition that stress is related to loss of resources, threat of resource loss, and/or when resources are invested without gain or return (Hobfoll, 1988, 1989, 1991; Hobfoll & Lilly, 1993). Resources are categorized into four types: objects (e.g., physical possessions, natural resources), conditions (e.g., a good marriage, quality relationships), personal characteristics (e.g., high self-esteem, social competence), and energies (e.g., money, knowledge). Rapid loss of highly valuable resources assails basic values, places disproportionate demands on individual and col- lective resources, is beyond the typical range of resource use, and evokes powerful mental images, all of which contribute to psychological stress (Hobfoll, 1991). (Gill et al., 2012)
Conservatism
	•	Feeling anxious and insecure, you will tend to turn conservative with your knowledge, preferring to fit into the group and sticking to the procedures you have learned. (Greene, 2014)
	•	If you gain any kind of attention or success for your work in this phase, you face the great danger of creeping conservatism. You begin to fall in love with the ideas and strategies that worked for you in the past. You become subtly addicted to the material comforts you have acquired and before you know it, you uphold ideas that you think you believe in, but that really are tied to your need to please the audience or your sponsors, or whomever. (Greene, 2014)
Contagion
	•	Naturally, the contagion of behaviours, as well as rumours and ideas, is different in many respects from that of diseases. Unlike contagion, the act of spreading information is necessarily intentional. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
	•	Dans les foules, les idées, les sentiments, les émotions, les croyances possèdent un pouvoir contagieux aussi intense que celui des microbes. (Lebon, 1895)
Contestation
	•	Et ce n’est pas sans doute pas un hazard si la contestation est si largement présente dans la vie des sociétés et affecte tous les milieu : socioprofesssionnel, politique, religieux, pédagogique, artistique. Ses rapports avec les norms établies ne manquent pas d’être ambigus. (Mannoni, 1985)
Context
	•	context is a compounded concept that is not so tamed by theory that with sufficiently careful study its dangers can be well enough understood, treated, and even preventively defanged. (Gray, 2014)
Consistency
	•	consistency is clearly an appropriate guideline for evaluating evidence. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	People formulate alternative explanations or estimates and select the one that encompasses the greatest amount of evidence within a logically consistent scenario. Under some circumstances, however, consistency can be deceptive. Information may be consistent only because it is highly cor- related or redundant, in which case many related reports may be no more informative than a single report. Or it may be consistent only because information is drawn from a very small sample or a biased sample. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	there is an illusion of validity caused by the consistency of the information. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	When working with a small but consistent body of evidence, analysts need to consider how representative that evidence is of the total body of poten tially available information. (Heuer, 1999)
Internal consistency
	•	The internal consistency in a pattern of evidence helps determine our confidence in judgments based on that evidence. (Heuer, 1999)
Constructivism
	•	[…] constructivism defines itself, at least in part, in and through its opposition to neo-realism/neo-liberalism on the one hand and postmodernism on the other. (Hay, 2002)
	•	[…] constructivism rejects the rationalism on which the neo-neosynthesis is premised, seeking to render its analytical assumptions more complex and realistic. (Hay, 2002)
	•	[…] the challenge posed by constructivism to the mainstream is considerable (Hay, 2002)
	•	Moreover, constructivism in international relations theory and the new institutionalism in political science would seem to perform very similar roles within their respective sub-disciples, valuing similar things and drawing attention to the role of institutions and ideas in the understanding of complex poetical change (Hay, 2002)
	•	[…] constructivism in international relations theory, might be seen as reactions to what they perceive to be the dangers of overly parsimonious theoretical assumptions (Hay, 2002)
	•	[…] constructivism in international relations are rather more disparate school of thought. (Hay, 2002)
	•	[…] constructivism are united in their resistance to purely deductive and purely inductive logic in political analysis. (Hay, 2002)
	•	[…] constructivism refers to a relatively distinctive position which blends, at times, into relativism and has many similarities with what would now be termed postmodernism. (Hay, 2002)
	•	The philosophical constructivism is distinctly anti-realism in its rejection of the notion of an external reality independent of our knowledge and conceptions of it. (Hay, 2002)
	•	Constructivism is a structural theory of the international system that makes the following core claims: (1) states are the principal units of analysis for international political theory; (2) the key structures in the state system are intersubjective rather than material; and (3) state identities and interests are in important part constructed by social structures, rather than given exogenously to the system by human nature or domestic politics. (1994: 385) (Hay, 2002)
Construct validity
	•	[…] construct validity – which relates to how well a measure or representation conforms with what it is designed to measure or represent (P.E. Spector 1993) – is not easy to confirm empirically. (Davies et al., 2002)
Contingency
	•	For the British Civil Contingencies Secretariat, a contingency is the “possible future emergency or risk that must be prepared for,” […]. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	We do not know the structure of the future security context which must be the source of possible future contingencies, but even if we did, we could not know in reliably useful detail why one contingent happening rather than others will occur. All of this argument demands that we treat the certainty of contingency in the context of chance, in practice meaning that although nothing can happen without cause, that causation is not usefully predictable. (Gray, 2014)
Contingency plan
	•	Contingency plans also put forth an organization's goals; they ofteninclude elaborate justifications for those goals as well. (Clarke, 1999)
	•	contingency plans help to reduce the main uncertainties that organizations most worry about. (Clarke, 1999)
	•	Contingency plans reflect risk assessments, although they areless formal than the mathematical and statistical models usually used to express probabilities, risks, and benefits. (Clarke, 1999)
	•	Perhaps the most important (manifest) function of contingency plans is to serve as blueprints for interagency coordination of responsibility, authority, and informationflows. (Clarke, 1999)
Oil spill contingency
	•	Oil spill contingency plans are attempts to model resources and trouble. They formalize for organizations the kinds of materials, technology, and personnel that might be necessary to respond to problems. (Clarke, 1999)
	•	Contingency plans for large oil spills on the open sea are fantasy documents. (Clarke, 1999)
	•	The utility of contingency plans for major oil spills is more symbolicthan instrumental. Their production gives the impression that organi- zations, especially corporations and regulatory agencies, can effec- tively manage the negative externalities of massive oil production. These plans, furthermore, organize political discussions about oil disaster, tanker safety, conservation, and offshore oil leasing. (Clarke, 1999)
Contingency planning
	•	The term contingency planning literally means planning to meet different contingencies (future issues), although it is sometimes used to mean preparedness (for instance Heerkens, 2002, p. 150). (Newsome, 2013)
	•	For the UN, contingency planning is “a management tool used to ensure that adequate arrangement are made in anticipation of a crisis” (UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs [OCHA], 2003) or “a management process that analyses specific potential levents or emerging situations that might threaten society or the environment and estbilashes arrangements in advance to enable timely, effective, and appropriate responses to such events and situations” (UN ISDR, 2009, p. 3). (Newsome, 2013)
	•	For the Humanitarian Practice Network (2010, p.xv) contingency planning is “a management tool used to ensure adequate preparation for a variety of potential emergency situations […]” (Newsome, 2013)
	•	For Public Safety Canada (2012) a contingency plan is “a plan developed for a specific event or incident” (p. 17). (Newsome, 2013)
	•	[…] a contingency plan is a “plan prepared by a particular authority specifying the response to a potential incident within its area of jurisdiction”.
	•	[…] a contingency plan is “a plan which is developed for possible operations where the panning factors have identified or can be assumed. This plan is produced in as much detail as possible, including the resources needed and deployment options, as a basis for subsequent planning” (p. 234). (Newsome, 2013)
Civil contingency planning
	•	[…] a civil contingency planning is “civil protection provisions made for the preparation and planning of a response to and recovery from emergencies” (U.K. Cabinet Office, 2013). (Newsome, 2013)
Continuing analysis
	•	Continuing analysis involves reviewing each study for fundamental strengths and weaknesses, for example, quality-assurance issues, replicability, consistency with comparable studies, and peer-review status. (National Research Council (U.S.) et al., 2009)
Contributor
	•	[…] a contributor is an actor or agent in a positive state – an antonym of threat. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	The Canadian government refers to a contributor effectively as anything that contributes positively to the management of emergencies. (Newsome, 2013)
Controls
	•	Controls, such as dials, warning lights, audible alarms, and switches read the presence of these interactions and inform the operators and allow them to intervene. (Perrow, 1999)
	•	difficulty control systems have in reading the nature and source of failures. (Perrow, 1999)
	•	A control is anything that was intended to or effectively does reduce a risk. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	[…] a control reduces a risk […]. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	The control is not necessarily an absolute solution to the risk. It may reduce a risk to a still intolerable level or to an only temporarily tolerable level. Consequently, good risk management processes prescribe monitoring the risk, even after control. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Sometimes, scrupulous authorities assess a risk as tolerable but are forced to control it anyway by outside stakeholders, sometimes for unnecessary reasons. (Newsome, 2013)

Precontrol
	•	the precontrol state of the risk is usually known as the inherent risk. (Newsome, 2013)
Postcontrol
	•	the poscontrol state is usually known as the residual risk. (Newsome, 2013)
Control objectives
	•	Control objectives are statements of the intended result or purpose achieved by implementing security controls. (Landoll, 2011)
Control of attention 
	•	The ability to control attention is not simply a measure of intelligence; measures of efficiency in the control of attention predict performance of air traffic controllers and of Israeli Air Force pilots beyond the effects of intelligence. (Kahneman, 2012)
Control system
	•	One dimension is the three components that form the basis of any control system—that is, ways of gathering information, ways of setting standards, goals, or targets, and ways of changing behaviour to meet the standards or targets. (Hood et al., 2001)
	•	From a control-system perspective, however, information-gathering and behaviour-modification are just as important to the government of risk. (Hood et al., 2001)
Social control
	•	He would make Nikita Khrushchev, the future premier, do the gopak, a highly strenuous dance that included much squatting and kicking. It would often make Khrushchev sick to his stomach. The others he would have slow dance together while he smiled and laughed uproariously at the sight of grown men dancing as a couple. It was the ultimate form of control: the puppet master choreographing their every move. (Greene, 2018)
Conversation
	•	in a conversation people were rarely direct. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Her hidden desire was clearly indicated by her tone of voice, which gave emphasis to certain words. Her hope was that the others would pick this up and offer what she desired, but often the hints were ignored and she would be forced to come out and say what she wanted. Conversation after conversation fell into this recurring pattern. (Greene, 2018)
Conversation pattern
	•	conversation patterns reveal the relative position people feel they occupy. For instance, those who feel dominant will tend to talk more and interrupt frequently, as a means of asserting themselves. When there’s an argument that turns personal, they will resort to what is known as punctuation—they will find an action on the other side that started it all, even though clearly it is part of the relationship pattern. They assert their interpretation of who is to blame through their tone of voice and piercing looks. (Greene, 2018)
Convince
	•	When you try to convince people of something, one of three things will happen. First, you might inadvertently challenge a particular aspect of their self-opinion. In a discussion that might turn into an argument, you make them feel stupid or brainwashed or less than good. Even if you are subtle in your arguments, the implication is that you know better. If this happens, you make people even more defensive and resistant. Walls go up that will never come down.Second, you can leave their self-opinion in a neutral position— neither challenged nor confirmed. This often happens if you try to be reasonable and calm in your approach, avoiding any emotional extremes. In this scenario people remain resistant and dubious, but you have at least not tightened them up, and you have some room to maneuver them with your rational arguments.Third, you can actively confirm their self-opinion. In this case you are fulfilling one of people’s greatest emotional needs. We can imagine that we are independent, intelligent, decent, and self-reliant, but only other people can truly confirm this for us. And in a harsh and competitive world in which we are all prone to continual self-doubt, we almost never get this validation that we crave. When you give it to people, you will have the magical effect that occurred when you yourself were drunk, or at a rally, or in love. You will make people relax. No longer consumed by insecurities, they can direct their attention outward. Their minds open, making them susceptible to suggestion and insinuation. If they decide to help you, they feel like they are doing this of their own free will. (Greene, 2018)
	•	instill in people a feeling of inner security. Mirror their values; show that you like and respect them. Make them feel you appreciate their wisdom and experience. Generate an atmosphere of mutual warmth. Get them to laugh along with you, instilling a feeling of rapport. All of this works best if the feelings are not completely faked. By exercising your empathy, by getting inside their perspective (see chapter 2 for more on this), you are more likely to genuinely feel at least a part of such emotions. Practice this often enough and confirming people’s self-opinion will become your default position—you will have a loosening-up effect on almost everyone you encounter. (Greene, 2018)

Coordination
	•	coordination means that two or more actors share knowledge and frames of reference so thoroughly that when those actors are called upon to perform some task they behave in waysthat mesh without effort. (Clarke, 1999)
Copenhagen School 
	•	[…] ‘Copenhagen School’, draws upon social contructivism and post-structuralism and in particular develops the notion of ‘securitization’. ed’ and so seen as outside the scope of security studies). (Grey, 2009)
	•	The Copenhagen approach links to more thoroughgoing post-structuralist and deconstructionist analyses of security, such as that of Campbell (1998) who explains US foreign policy in terms of the production of an American self via the construction of a dangerous and threatening foreign ‘other’ (other examples of such analyses include Der Derian, 1995; Dillon, 2006). (Grey, 2009)
	•	Copenhagen also has affinities to an increasing stream of feminist work on security (e.g. Tickner, 1992), although has itself been criticized for largely ignoring and excluding feminist work (Hansen, 2000; c.f. Krause, 1998). (Grey, 2009)
Corporate governance
	•	[…] the idea of corporate governance is itself complex and multifaceted, a common feature across all global and national initiatives is an emphasis on the integrity of 'internal control' systems (Power, 2009)
Correlation
	•	Correlations are present in most real-world networks. Although there is no general rule, most natural and technological networks tend to be disassortative, while social networks tend to be assortative. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
Assortative correlation
	•	This is called disassortative mixing. Both cases display a form of correlation in the degrees of neighbouring nodes. When the degrees of neihbours are positively correlated, then the mixing is assortative; when negatively, it is disassortative. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
Dissortative correlation
	•	This is called disassortative mixing. Both cases display a form of correlation in the degrees of neighbouring nodes. When the degrees of neihbours are positively correlated, then the mixing is assortative; when negatively, it is disassortative. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
Negative correlation
	•	This is called disassortative mixing. Both cases display a form of correlation in the degrees of neighbouring nodes. When the degrees of neihbours are positively correlated, then the mixing is assortative; when negatively, it is disassortative. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
Positive correlation
	•	This is called disassortative mixing. Both cases display a form of correlation in the degrees of neighbouring nodes. When the degrees of neihbours are positively correlated, then the mixing is assortative; when negatively, it is disassortative. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
Corrosive communities
	•	Corrosive communities are characterized by a loss of trust in institutions and organizations charged with protecting them from the risks of modern technology (Picou et al., 2004). (Gill et al., 2012)
Counter-profilferation
	•	Preventing the potential aggressor from acquiring the capabilities to threaten us is the objective behind the many strategies called “counter-profilferation”, which aim to reduce the supply of arms to hazardous actors (such as undriendly states, insurgents, and terrorists). (Newsome, 2013)
Counter-terrorism
	•	Counter-terrorism sometimes includes campaigns to persuade people to separate from terrorist groups. (Newsome, 2013)
Counterterrorism analyst
	•	Counterterrorism analysts also perform the difficult and tedious work of tracking terrorists and finding patterns among their activities.  (Marrin, 2002)
	•	According to Mark Kauppi, “analysts also provide an important service by carefully constructing detailed analyses of the structure of terrorist organizations that can assist operators and foreign security services in the dismantling of terrorist networks.” (Marrin, 2002)
	•	He observes that neutralizing terrorists before they implement their plans avoids the difficulties of “predict(ing) when, where, and how terrorists will strike.” (Marrin, 2002)
	•	CTC analysts also produce warning intelligence which--according to Mark Kauppi--is “the number one job of the counterterrorism analyst.” (Marrin, 2002)
Country risk
	•	country risk refers to the analysis of the creditworthiness of a country (Sottilotta, 2016)
Coupling
	•	The degree of organization is independent of the degree of coupling. (Perrow, 1999)
	•	The structural factors of interactive complexity and tight coupling are seen as significantly increasing the likelihood of accidents in such organizations, regardless of the intent of the leaders. (Sagan, 1995)
	•	Particularly relevant to the intelligence environment, different departments constantly interact when confronted with a problem, generating hypotheses about “what is going on, what can be done, and what the long- term, system-wide consequences of the proposed action might be.” Such interdepartmental interaction brings different perspectives to the table, building a progressively more complex vision of the problem at hand, and reducing the chances that key aspects of a problem will be overlooked. (Fishbein and Treverton, 2004)

Loosely coupled
	•	Loosely coupled systems tend to have ambiguous or perhaps flexible performance standards, and they may, as in the case of the school, have little consumer monitoring, so the absence of the intended connection can remain unobserved. (Perrow, 1999)
	•	Loose coupling, then, allows certain parts of the system to express themselves according to their own logic or interests. (Perrow, 1999)
	•	In loosely coupled systems, delays are possible; processes can remain in a standby mode; partially finished products (tail assemblies or students) will not change much while waiting. (Perrow, 1999)
	•	Loosely coupled systems are said to have "equifinality"—many ways to skin the cat; tightly coupled ones have "unifinality." (Perrow, 1999)
	•	In loosely coupled systems, supplies and equipment and humanpower can be wasted without great cost to the system. Something can be done twice if it is not correct the first time; one can temporarily get by with lower quality in supplies or products in the production line. (Perrow, 1999)
	•	In loosely coupled systems there is a better chance that expedient, spur-of-the-moment buffers and redundancies and substitutions can be found, even though they were not planned ahead of time. (Perrow, 1999)
	•	In loosely coupled systems, in addition to ESDs and ESFs, fortuitous recovery aids are often possible. Failures can be patched more easily, a temporary rig can be set up, a crane moved over, a pancake landing made without power. (Perrow, 1999)
	•	loosely coupled systems necessarily have sufficient designed-in safety devices; typically, designers perceive they have a safety margin in the form of fortuitous safety devices, and neglect to install even quite obvious ones. (Perrow, 1999)
	•	Loosely coupled or decoupled systems have fewer or less tight links between parts and therefore are able to absorb failures or unplanned behavior without destabilization. (Marais et al., 2004)

Tight coupling
	•	tight coupling is a mechanical term meaning there is no slack or buffer or give between two items (Perrow, 1999)
	•	a continuous processing plant requires tight coupling. (Perrow, 1999)
	•	Tightly coupled systems have more time-dependent processes: they cannot wait or stand by until attended to. (Perrow, 1999)
	•	sequences in tightly coupled systems are more invariant. (Perrow, 1999)
	•	In tightly coupled systems, not only are the specific sequences invariant, but the overall design of the process allows only one way to reach the production goal. (Perrow, 1999)
	•	Tightly coupled systems have little slack. Quantities must be precise; resources cannot be substituted for one another; wasted supplies may overload the process; failed equipment entails a shutdown because the temporary substitution of other equipment is not possible. 
	•	In tightly coupled systems the buffers and redundancies and substitutions must be designed in; they must be thought of in advance. (Perrow, 1999)
	•	Tightly coupled systems offer few such opportunities. (Sagan, 1995)
	•	First, tightly coupled systems have more time-dependent processes (Sagan, 1995)
	•	Second, in tightly coupled systems the sequences and coordinated activities needed to produce the product are invariant (Sagan, 1995)
	•	Third, tightly coupled systems have little slack (Sagan, 1995)
	•	Fourth, safety devices, redundancies, and buffers between parts of the production process in tightly coupled systems are largely limited to those that have been planned and designed into the system. (Sagan, 1995)
	•	Perrow also argues that characteristics of highly centralized decision-making – strict standard operating procedures, unquestioned individual obedience, and immediate response – are equally necessary in tightly coupled systems. Because tightly coupled systems have invariant and time-dependent production processes with little built-in slack, there is no time for improvisation by operators in crises and little scope for recovery from faulty field-level decision. (Sagan, 1995)
	•	tight coupling (which causes the failures out escalate rapid out of control) (Sagan, 1995)
	•	A tightly coupled system is one that is highly interdependent: Each part of the system is tightly linked to many other parts and therefore a change in one part can rapidly affect the status of other parts. (Marais et al., 2004)
	•	Tightly coupled systems respond quickly to perturbations, but this response may be disastrous. (Marais et al., 2004)
Correlation
	•	Statistical measurement of covariation is known as correlation. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Two events are correlated when the existence of one event implies the existence of the other. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Variables are correlated when a change in one variable implies a similar degree of change in another. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Correlation alone does not necessarily imply causation. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	two events might co-occur because they have a common cause, rather than because one causes the other. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	inaccurate perception of correlation leads to inaccurate perception of cause and effect. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Judgments about correlation are fundamental to all intelligence analysis. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	It is well known that correlation does not imply causation; the study of chaos has made it clear that causation does not imply (linear) correlation either. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
Illusory correlation
	•	Illusory correlation occurs when people perceive a relationship that does not in fact exist. In looking at a series of cases, it seems that people often focus on instances that support the existence of a relationship but ignore those cases that fail to support it. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Several experiments have dem- onstrated that people do not have an intuitive understanding of what information is really needed to assess the relationship between two events or two variables. There appears to be nothing in people’s intuitive understanding that corresponds with the statistical concept of correlation. (Heuer, 1999)
Courage
	•	Courage allowed the soldier to give of his own life for something greater: unit, regiment, country or cause which made life worthwhile. (Coker, 2009)
	•	Courage, insisted Hannah Arendt, is demanded of prac- tically everything we do. It is the bedrock of political life. (Coker, 2009)
	•	Courage is one of the cardinal political virtues. (Coker, 2009)
	•	Courage liberates us to fight for what makes life worthwhile: our beliefs, our freedom or simply other people (Arendt 1977:132−5). (Coker, 2009)
Court
	•	Any type of court obviously revolves around the leader. (Greene, 2018)
	•	In any court, there are inevitably those with a low character, who live for scheming and knocking heads. (Greene, 2018)
	•	See everyone in the court as your potential ally. (Greene, 2018)
Courtier
	•	courtiers have to gain the attention of leaders and ingratiate themselves in some way. The most immediate way to do this is through flattery, since leaders inevitably have large egos and a hunger to have their high self-opinion validated. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Flattery can do wonders, but it comeswith risks. If it is too obvious, the flatterer looks desperate, and it is easy to see through the strategy. The best courtiers know how to tailor their flattery to the particular insecurities of the leader and to make it less direct. They focus on flattering qualities in the leader that no one else has bothered to pay attention to but that need extra validation. If everyone praises the leader’s business acumen but not his or her cultural refinement, you will want to aim at the latter. Mirroring the leader’s ideas and values, without using their exact words, can be a highly effective form of indirect flattery. (Greene, 2018)
	•	you must pay great attention to the other courtiers. Standing out too much, being seen as too brilliant or charming, will stir up envy, and you will die by a thousand bites. You want as many courtiers on your side as possible. Learn to downplay your successes, to listen (or seem to listen) deeply to the ideas of others, strategically giving them credit and praise in meetings, paying attention to their insecurities. If you must take action against particular courtiers, make it as indirect as possible, working to slowly isolate them in the group, never appearing too aggressive. Courts are always supposed to seem civilized. Be aware that the best courtiers are consummate actors and that their smiles and professions of loyalty mean very little. In the court, it does not pay to be naive. Without being paranoid, try to question people’s motives. (Greene, 2018)
	•	you need to be aware of the types of courtiers you will find in most courts and the particular dangers they can pose. One aggressive but clever courtier with little conscience can quickly dominate the group. (For more on the types of courtiers, see the next section.) (Greene, 2018)
	•	Any type of court obviously revolves around the leader, the courtiers’ power depending on the relative closeness of their relationship with this leader. Although leaders come in many varieties, one dynamic is fairly universal: the courtiers (minus the cynical types, see below) will tend to idealize those in power. They will see their leaders as smarter, cleverer, more perfect than is the reality. This will make it easier for them to justify their fawning behavior. (Greene, 2018)
	•	This dynamic is similar to what we all experienced in childhood: we idealized our parents in order to feel more secure about the power they had over us. (Greene, 2018)
	•	We may want to monopolize the leaders’ attention as we once tried to do with our mother or father. (Greene, 2018)
	•	we can say that courtiers tend to fall into certain types, depending on deep patterns stemming from childhood. (Greene, 2018)
Favourite
	•	the Favorite’s rise in power is often based on cultivating a more personal, friend-like relationship. Early on, they act relaxed and chummy with the leader, without seeming disrespectful. Many leaders are secretly dying to not have to be so formal and in control. Sometimes leaders who are lonely will pick out one person to occupy this position. With the Favorite, they will gladly share secrets and bestow favors. This, of course, will stir up the envy of other courtiers. (Greene, 2018)
	•	This position is fraught with danger. First, it depends on the friendly feelings of leaders, and such feelings are inevitably fickle. People are more sensitive to the words or actions of friends, and if they feel somehow disappointed or betrayed in any way, they can go from liking to hating the former friend. Second, the Favorite receives so much privileged treatment that they often become arrogant and entitled. Leaders might tire of their spoiled behavior. Courtiers are already envious of the Favorite, but their increased arrogance only alienates them further. When Favorites fall from grace—and history is littered with such stories—the fall is hard and painful. No one comes to their defense, and because their rise did not depend on any special skill, they often have nowhere else to go. (Greene, 2018)
Covariation
	•	one basis for inferring causality. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	covariation may either be observed intuitively or measured statistically. (Heuer, 1999)
Covetousness
	•	Absence and presence have very primal effects upon us. Too much presence suffocates; a degree of absence spurs our interest. We are marked by the continual desire to possess what we do not have— the object projected by our fantasies. Learn to create some mystery around you, to use strategic absence to make people desire your return, to want to possess you. Dangle in front of others what they are missing most in life, what they are forbidden to have, and they will go crazy with desire. (Greene, 2018)
	•	All that was required was to reverse her perspective—to think of the audience first and to strategize how to play on their imagination. The objects she had desired since childhood were all somewhat vague, elusive, and taboo. That was their allure. That is the nature of human desire. She simply had to turn this around and incorporate such elements into the objects she created. (Greene, 2018)
	•	It was pure psychological magic that transformed them into objects that stimulated such intense desires to possess them. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Instead of focusing on what you want and covet in the world, you must train yourself to focus on others, on their repressed desires and unmet fantasies. You must train yourself to see how they perceive you and the objects you make, as if you were looking at yourself and your work from the outside. This will give you the almost limitless power to shape people’s perceptions about these objects and excite them. (Greene, 2018)
	•	People do not want truth and honesty, no matter how much we hear such nonsense endlessly repeated. They want their imaginations to be stimulated and to be taken beyond their banal circumstances. They want fantasy and objects of desire to covet and grope after. Create an air of mystery around you and your work. Associate it with something new, unfamiliar, exotic, progressive, and taboo. Do not define your message but leave it vague. Create an illusion of ubiquity—your object is seen everywhere and desired by others. Then let the covetousness so latent in all humans do the rest, setting off a chain reaction of desire. (Greene, 2018)
	•	By nature, we humans are not easily contented with our circumstances. By some perverse force within us, the moment we possess something or get what we want, our minds begin to drift toward something new and different, to imagine we can have better. The more distant and unattainable this new object, the greater is our desire to have it. We can call this the grass-is-always-greener syndrome, the psychological equivalent of an optical illusion—if we get too close to the grass, to that new object, we see that is not really so green after all. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Knowing how to work on people’s natural covetousness is a timeless art that we depend on for all forms of persuasion. The problem we face today is not that people have suddenly stopped coveting but quite the opposite: that we are losing our connection to this art and the power that goes with it. (Greene, 2018)
	•	People may point to all of this as evidence that we humans are becoming more honest and truthful, but human nature does not change within a few generations. People have become more obvious and forthright not out of some deep moral calling but out of increasing self-absorption and overall laziness. It requires no effort to simply be oneself or to blast one’s message. And the lack of effort simply results in a lack of effect on other people’s psychology. It means that people’s interest in you will be paper thin. Their attention will quickly move on and you will not see the reason for this. Do not swallow the easy moralism of the day, which urges honesty at the expense of desirability. Go in the opposite direction. With so few people out there who understand the art of desirability, it affords you endless opportunities to shine and exploit people’s repressed fantasies. (Greene, 2018)
	•	The key to making this law work for you is to objectify yourself and what you produce. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Normally you are locked in your own thoughts and dreams. You imagine people should love and respect you for who you are. You believe that what you produce should naturally excite people. After all, you have invested a lot of effort and have high hopes for success. But others see none of this. To them, you are just a person among others, and as a person you inspire either curiosity xcitement or indifference, and, even hostility. They project onto you their own fantasies and preconceptions. Once made public, your work is also an object completely divorced from your own hopes and dreams, and it inspires emotions that are weak or strong. To the degree that you can see yourself and what you produce as objects that people perceive in their own manner, you have the power to alter their perceptions and create objects of desire. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Know how and when to withdraw. This is the essence of the art. You have a presence that people see and interpret. If you are too obvious with this, if people can read you too easily and figure you out, if you show your needs too visibly, then they will unconsciously begin to have a degree of disrespect; over time they will lose interest. Your presence must have a touch of coldness to it, as if you feel like you could do without others. This signals to people that you consider yourself worthy of respect, which unconsciously heightens your value in their eyes. It makes people want to chase after you. This touch of coldness is the first form of withdrawal that you must practice. Add to this a bit of blankness and ambiguity as to who you are. Your opinions, values, and tastes are never too obvious to people. This gives them room to read into you what they want. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Once you sense that you have engaged people’s imagination, that you have your hooks in them, then you must use physical absence and withdrawal. You are not so available. A day or week can go by without your presence. You create a feeling of emptiness inside them, a touch of pain. You occupy increasing amounts of their mental space in these absences. They come to want more of you, not less. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Through this strategic elusiveness he made himself an object of continual desire—both to know him better and to possess his music. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Always leave the presentation and the message relatively open-ended. People can read into your work several interpretations. Never define exactly how they should take or use it. This is why the work of great dramatists such as Shakespeare and Chekhov has lasted for so many centuries and always seem so fresh and exciting; each generation can read into their plays what they want to. These writers described timeless elements of human nature, but without judging or directing the audience to what they should feel or think. Take that as the model for whatever you produce. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Keep in mind the following: the more active our imagination becomes, the greater the pleasure we derive from it. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Through your work you want to stimulate this pleasure for people to the maximum degree. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Create rivalries of desire. Human desire is never an individual phenomenon. We are social creatures and what we want almost always reflects what other people want. This stems from our earliest years. (Greene, 2018)
	•	You must learn how to exploit this. If you can somehow create the impression that others desire you or your work, you will pull people into your current without having to say a word or impose yourself. They will come to you. You must strive to surround yourself with this social aura, or at least create the illusion. (Greene, 2018)
	•	As an individual you must make it clear that people desire you, that you have a past—not too much of a past to inspire mistrust but enough to signal that others have found you desirable. You want to be indirect in this. You want them to hear stories of your past. You want them to literally see the attention you receive from men or women, all of this without your saying a word. Any bragging or explicit signaling of this will neutralize the effect. (Greene, 2018)
	•	In any negotiating situation you must always strive to bring in a third or fourth party to vie for your services, creating a rivalry of desire. This will immediately enhance your value, not just in terms of a bidding war but also in the fact that people will see that others covet you. (Greene, 2018)
	•	You can incorporate this into your work by giving the impression you are revealing secrets that should really not be shared. Some will be outraged but everyone will be curious. These could be secrets about yourself and how you accomplished what you did, or it could be about others, what happens behind the closed doors of powerful people and the laws that they operate by. (Greene, 2018)
	•	offers the fantasy of a quick path to wealth and success, of recovering lost youth, of becoming a new person, and even of conquering death itself. People will grasp greedily at such things because they are considered so impossible. By the law of induction we can imagine all of these shortcuts and fantasies (just as we can imagine a unicorn), which gives us the desire to reach them, and imagining them is almost like experiencing them. (Greene, 2018)
	•	it is not possession but desire that secretly impels people. To possess something inevitably brings about some disappointment and sparks the desire for something new to pursue. You are preying upon the human need for fantasies and the pleasures of chasing after them. In this sense your efforts must be continually renewed. Once people get what they want or possess you, your value and their respect for you immediately begin to lower. Keep withdrawing, surprising, and stimulating the chase. As long as you do, you have the power. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Our path must always be toward greater awareness of our nature. We must see within ourselves the grass-is-always-greener syndrome at work and how it continually impels us to certain actions. We need to be able to distinguish between what is positive and productive in our covetous tendencies and what is negative and counterproductive. On the positive side, feeling restless and discontented can motivate us to search for something better and to not settle for what we have. It enlarges our imagination as we consider other possibilities instead of the circumstances we face. As we get older, we tend to become more complacent, and renewing the restlessness of our earlier years can keep us youthful and our minds active. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Calming down our covetous desires, we can then learn the arts of compromise and how to make a relationship work, which never come easily or naturally. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Life is short and we have only so much energy. Led by our covetous desires, we can waste so much time in futile searches and changes. In general, do not constantly wait and hope for something better, but rather make the most of what you have. (Greene, 2018)

Matthew effect
	•	“At the beginning of the sixties, sociologist Harriet Zuckerman interviewed a number of scientists who had received the Nobel Prize. She aimed at finding what was so special in their way of working, and what the secret of their success in research was. She found a recurring theme in the answers of the Nobelists. A laureate in physics said: ‘The world is peculiar in this matter of how it gives credit. It tends to give the credit to [already] famous people.’ A laureate in chemistry added: ‘When people see my name on a paper, they are apt to remember it, and not to remember the other names.’ And a laureate in physiology and medicine specified: ‘[When you read a scientific paper] you usually notice the name that you’re familiar with. Even if it’s last it will be the one that sticks […] You remember that, rather than the long list of authors.’ ‘The man who’s best known gets more credit, an inordinate amount of credit,’ concluded a laureate in physics.Those observations led another sociologist (and later husband of Zuckerman), Robert Merton, to formulate in 1968 a brilliant law. Merton put forward that science is under the effect of a[…].  (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
Crystallization 
	•	“Crystallization,” in the field of physical chemistry, describes the process by which an amorphous entity—a gas or suspension in fluid form—is transformed into a solid coherent mass. For Bernays, “crystallizing public opinion” was about taking an “ill-defined, mercurial and changeable group of individual judgments” and transforming them into a cohesive and manageable form. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
Cue
Negative cues
	•	cues, what should have happened but did not. (Greene, 2014)
Cult
	•	People have a profound need to believe in something, and in the absence of great unifying belief systems, this void is easily filled by all kinds of microcauses and cults. (Greene, 2018)
Culture
	•	[…] culture is a system of persons holding one another mutually accountable (Douglas, 2005:31)
	•	[…] culture is fraught with the political implications of mutual accountability. Instead of imagining the isolated individual testing every piece of news without bias or moral commitment, the person is assumed to be sifting possible information through a collectively constructed censor set to a given standard of accountability (Douglas, 2005:31)
	•	Culture is nothing if not a collective product (Douglas, 2005:125)
	•	culture itself is constrained (Douglas, 2005:136)
	•	[…] culture refers to groups […] (van der Linden, 2016)
	•	[…] “culture” is defined as a measurable “cultural worldview,” which by and large represents a “political outlook,” […]. (van der Linden, 2016)
	•	there is no universally accepted definition of “culture”. (van der Linden, 2016)
	•	A culture is a collection of dominant norms, values, and beliefs in a group or organization. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	All cultures are peculiar to their societies, but different societies can be linked by common cultures or similar cultures that can be described. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Our culture depends in many ways on the creation of standards and conventions that we all must adhere to. These conventions are often expressed in terms of opposites – good and evil, beautiful and ugly, painful and pleasurable, rational and irrational, intellectual and sensual. Believing in these opposites gives our world a sense of cohesion and comfort. (Greene, 2014)
	•	La culture d’une société détermine sans doute les couches profondes de la personnalité de ses membres par le canal des techniques spécifiques d’élevage auxquelles elle soumet les enfants, mais son influence ne s’arrête pas là, écrit R. Linton (1977, p. 127) ; elle continue à informer le reste de la personnalité en fournissant à l’individu des exemples de réponses spécifiques. » (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	La société produit donc, on le voit, un système d’information à vocation normative auquel répond un complexe attitudinal de conformation chez l’individu. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	we pick out what our culture has already defined for us. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
Today culture
	•	we live in a much more rational, scientifically oriented culture today. People are more transparent and self-aware than ever, we might say. We are much less repressed than our ancestors, who had to deal with all sorts of pressures from organized religion. (Greene, 2018)
Culture of scientism
	•	The culture of scientism had in effect imposed identity upon social actors by demanding their identification with particular social institutions and their ideologies, notably in constructions of risk, but also in definitions of sanity, proper sexual behaviour, and countless other ‘rational’ frames of modern social control’ (Lash and Wynne, 1992)
Cultural analysis
	•	Cultural analysis is a countervailing vision which warns what categories in each kind of culture are most likely to be at risk, who will be sinned against, and who will be counted as the sinner exposing the others to risk (Douglas, 2005:36)
	•	cultural analysis is concerned with only one cause of breakdown, the collapse of the normative debate (Douglas, 2005:135)
Cultural bias
	•	[…] it has been suggested that characteris- tic attributes of cultural bias, particularly, preferred aesthetics, principles of social justice, and perceived economic interests, will lead members of each type of institution to choose a particular liability distribution. (Rayner and Cantor, 1987)
	•	Since cultural biases are forms of ideology, there should be high correlations between certain biases and corresponding ideologies (e.g., egalitarianism and political liberalism). (Wildavsky and Dake, 1990)
	•	cultural theory's predictions for the individualist bias are just the opposite: its adherents perceive the dangers of technology as minimal, in part because they trust that their institutions can control or compensate for the severity of untoward events. (Wildavsky and Dake, 1990)
	•	defined as 'shared values and beliefs' (Boholm, 1996)
	•	cultural bias governs perception (Boholm, 1996)
Cultural comparison 
Etic approach
	•	etic approach which adopts an external perspective, uses an apparatus of descriptive and explanatory devices - typologies, categories, and concepts - achieved by means of comparison and generalized reasoning. (Boholm, 1996)
Emic approach
	•	The emic approach, which analyzes culture in terms of indigenous distinctions and categories, on the other hand, assumes an internal perspective. (Boholm, 1996)
Cultural correctness
	•	We live in a culture that enforces powerful codes of correctness that we must abide by or face the shaming that is now so common on social media. We are supposed to live up to ideals of selflessness, which are impossible for us because we are not angels. All of this drives the dark side of our personalities even further underground. (Greene, 2018)
Culture of individualism 
	•	culture of individualism severely constrains how and what the government can do and the culture of hierarchy severely constrains the market (Douglas, 2005:33)
Cultural evolution
	•	Cultural evolution can be said to be Lamarckian in the sense that acquired traits and skills can be passed on over generations at ever faster rates. (Coker, 2009)
Cultural theory
	•	Cultural theory brings us somewhat nearer to understanding risk perception of lay persons by providing a systematic view of the widest range of goals that the person is seeking to achieve (Douglas, 2005:51)
	•	[…] cultural theory should explain how any type of collectivity can resist pressures to transform (Douglas, 2005:137)
	•	Cultural theory starts by assuming that a culture is a system of persons holding one another mutually accountable (Douglas, 2005:31)
	•	Viewing individuals as the active organizers of their own perceptions, cultural theorists have proposed that individuals choose what to fear (and how much to fear it), in order to support their way of life. In this perspective, selective attention to risk, and preferences among different types of risk taking (or avoiding), correspond to cultural biases? that is, to worldviews or ideologies entailing deeply. (Wildavsky and Dake, 1990)
	•	Social relations are defined in cultural theory as a small number of distinctive patterns of interpersonal relationships – hierarchical, egalitarian, or individualist. No causal priority is given to cultural biases or social relations; they are always found together interacting in a mutually reinforcing manner. Thus there are no relationships without cultural biases to justify them, and no biases without relations to uphold them. (Wildavsky and Dake, 1990)
	•	Socially viable combinations of cultural biases and social relations are referred to in cultural theory as ways of life or as political cultures. (Wildavsky and Dake, 1990)
	•	More specifically, then, hierarchical, egalitarian, and individualist forms of social relations, together with the cultural biases that justify them, are each hypothesized to engender distinctive representations of what constitutes a hazard and what does not. (Wildavsky and Dake, 1990)
	•	Among all possible risks, those selected for worry or dismissal are functional in the sense that they strengthen one of these ways of life and weaken the others. (Wildavsky and Dake, 1990)
	•	Cultural themy aims to explain universal "cultural bias' by way of a general typology of group formation and a concomitant cosmology or world view. (Boholm, 1996)
	•	The cultural theory of risk, or 'cultural theory', as it is called by its propo- nents, has been highly influential in all debates about risk perception and risk communication. The theory is based on Douglas's grid-group theory of society, which she first formulated in the 197os. Developed by Douglas and some collaborators such as the political scientist Aaron Wildaysky, social anthropolo- gists Michael Thompson and Steve Rayner, and social psychologist Karl Dake, cultural theory has launched an ambitious program that aims to 'pre- dict and explain what kinds of people will perceive which potential hazards to be how dangerous' (Wildaysky & Dake 1990:42). How people understand and react to various kinds of risks, cultural theory argues, can be explained neither by personality traits nor by reference to a framework that claims that people act according to a given, general hierarchy of psycho-physiological needs and preferences. Risks are culturally 'biased', meaningful phenomena, and the perception of risks is highly influenced by socially embedded values and beliefs. Choices about risk taking and avoidance are made selectively on the basis of the 'way of life' or 'world view' an individual adheres to. (Boholm, 1996)
	•	[…] ability to explain and even predict risk perception. (Boholm, 1996)
	•	[…] cultural theory's postulates about peoples' attitudes to and relationships towards risks is based on a general theory of social life. (Boholm, 1996)
	•	Cultural theory is a general sociological theory, constructed according to the tenets of positivistic reasoning, by way of deduction from a limited number of basic axioms, regarding human social beings and their interaction. (Boholm, 1996)
	•	cultural theory construes individuals as socially constrained. (Boholm, 1996)
	•	Advocates of cultural theory often seem to imply that, in principle, there is a one-to-one correspondence between an individual and a particular way of life. The indi- vidual, through his actions and by way of his beliefs, struggles to support andmaintain his 'way of life'. (Boholm, 1996)
	•	Cultural theory states that each way of life constitutes a bounded rationality, aself-explanatory system o f mutually reinforcing beliefs, values, and social relationships (Rayner Be Cantor 1987:4). Each world view contains distinct ways of coping with failure and through these coping mechanisms, threat, danger, evil, and failure are not only imbued with meaning but they actually strengthen the world view; its efficacy restated through the presence of negative elements. Blame, ideas about pollution, purity and danger, and actions undertaken to counteract various instances of threat and defilement thereforeserve to support and sustain a way of life (Douglas 1966). (Boholm, 1996)
	•	Cultural theory argues that each person's adherence to a certain 'way of life' determines his ideas of risks and danger. Each way of life, furthermore, is combined with one of four basic 'myths of nature' (Thompson et al. 1990: 26-29; Dake 1992; Douglas 1996:85-90). Egalitarians will be afraid of technology and hold that it has little benefit, they will think that nature is fragile; individualists will claim that nature is benign, affluent, and full of promise ('cornucopian'); hierarchists are afraid of social deviance, they regard nature as being 'perverse/tolerant', bound by certain rules, it will be benign if treatedproperly or dangerous if the rules are violated; egalitarians hold that nature is 'ephemeral', fragile and vulnerable, while fatalists regard nature as 'capricious' and unpredictable. (Boholm, 1996)
	•	The society envisaged by cultural theory is a society crowded with people adhering to disparate ways of life, the presuppositions of which having nothing in common. And since people will live in 'worlds apart' in their own society, they cannot be expected to be able to communicate or understand each other. (Boholm, 1996)
	•	For cul- tural theory, however, cultural relativism is only accepted within a pre-defined conceptual framework; etic considerations rule iron-fistedly over emic. (Boholm, 1996)
	•	Cultural theory proclaims that ways of life are competitive, always jostling for adherents. If people recognize that their cherished cosmology is no longer 'sensible', they might abandon it in order to encompass some other, more viable, alternative. Such shifts from one way of life to another might occur if an individual is confronted with a cumulative mass of 'surprise'. (Boholm, 1996)
	•	Cultural theory suffers from maladies characteristic of a functionalist paradigm. (Boholm, 1996)
	•	Cultural theory can therefore step strategically from rigidity to flexibility, from methodological collectivism to methodological individualism, depending on the empirical data it has at hand. (Boholm, 1996)
	•	Cultural theory is marred by the common faults of functionalist explanation; circular reasoning and thbralt ad hoc causal mechanisms that refer to hidden parameters such as 'surprise', 'reality', 'maximization', and 'rationalchoice'. (Boholm, 1996)
	•	Cultural theory assumes that 'risk' and perception of risk exist in human society as a universal feature that depends on certain decisive factors that can be classified in a general manner. (Boholm, 1996)
	•	Cultural theory aspires to be a general theory of risk. (Boholm, 1996)
Cultural values
	•	Cultural values and social location have always provided the materials for self-serving constructions of epidemiological risk. The poor, the alien, the sinner have all served as convenient objects for such stigmatizing speculations (Rosenberg, 1988 in Douglas, 2005:36)
	•	Cultures are generally characterized by their underlying value structures (Hofstede, 2001; Schwartz, 1992). (van der Linden, 2016)
Cultural cognition
	•	Cultural cognition embraces the cultural knowledge that emerges from the interactions between members of a cultural group across time and space. (Yamaguchi et al., 2014)
	•	[…] cultural cognition can be characterized as a “strange loop” as it frequently defines its core theoretical properties (e.g., group, culture, political ideology) in terms of one another.  (van der Linden, 2016)
	•	Theoretically, the approach can be seen as a conceptual marriage between the “cultural theory of risk” (Douglas & Wildavsky, 1982) and the psychometric paradigm (Slovic, 2000). Broadly, the theory aims to explain why groups with different “cultural outlooks” tend to disagree about impor- tant societal issues. (van der Linden, 2016)
	•	a strange loop involves “a series of stages where a shift occurs from one level of abstraction to another and despite one’s sense of departing ever further from one’s origin, one winds up, to one’s shock, exactly where one had started out” (Hofstadter, 2007, pp. 101-102). I borrow the term here to highlight that cultural cognition is exactly this, a strange loop. At various points, the cultural cognition project defines “culture” as pertaining to the shared values of “groups” (e.g., Kahan, 2010, 2015), where “groups” are often further defined as “political affinity groups” (e.g., Kahan, 2012), which are described as “culturally diverse” (e.g., Kahan, 2010). If culture refers to groups and groups refer to a collection of individuals who share a particular political outlook and, in turn, if differences in such politi- cal outlooks are ultimately meant to imply variation in culture, then we have just completed a strange loop! (van der Linden, 2016)
	•	Cognition generally refers to a broad set of mental capacities that are involved in acquiring knowledge, perception, attention, memory, judgment, and decision making. The term cultural cognition implies that these basic processes vary across cultures (Medin & Bang, 2014). (van der Linden, 2016)
	•	“cultural cognition” is not a theory about culture nor about cognition per se but rather a thesis about why specific American groups with differing preferences for the role of government in society disagree over a select number of “controversial” sci- ence issues. (van der Linden, 2016)
	•	“cultural cognition” can be characterized as a “strange loop” as it frequently defines its core properties (e.g., culture, group, ideology) in terms of one another. (van der Linden, 2016)

Cultural cognition thesis
	•	Another plausible conjecture — another hypothesis about the science communication paradox — is the “cultural cognition thesis” (CCT). CCT posits that certain types of group affinities are integral to the mental processes ordinary members of the public use to assess risk [Kahan et al., 2010]. (Kahan, 2015)
	•	When positions on facts become associated with opposing social groups — not universities but rather everyday networks of people linked by common moral values, political outlooks, and social norms — individuals selectively assess evidence in patterns that reflect their group identities [Kahan, 2011]. (Kahan, 2015)
	•	If people can be expected to fit their assessments of evidence to the dominant position within their cultural groups, then those individuals most adept in reasoning about scientific data should be even “better” at forming culturally congenial beliefs than their less adept peers. (Kahan, 2015)
	•	[…]the cultural cognition thesis argues that public disagreement over key societal risks (e.g., climate change, nuclear power) arises not because people fail to understand the science or lack relevant information, but rather as a result of the fact that “people endorse whichever position reinforces their connection to others with whom they share important ties” (Kahan, 2010, p. 296). (van der Linden, 2016)
	•	This latter notion is central to much of the cultural cognition thesis and is generally referred to as a specific form of motivated reasoning, namely, “identity-protective cognition”. (van der Linden, 2016)
	•	the cultural cognition thesis predicts that identity-protective reasoning is a mechanism that people unconsciously employ to assimilate (risk) information. In other words, people are expected to process informa- tion in a motivated way, that is, consistent with their cultural worldviews (Kahan, 2012). A key prediction that flows from this theory is that when people are exposed to (new) scientific information, “culturally” biased cog- nition will merely reinforce existing predispositions and cause groups with opposing values to become even more polarized on the respective issue (Kahan, 2010, 2012). (van der Linden, 2016)
Curiosity
	•	try to maintain a perfect balance between skepticism (rider) and curiosity (horse). (Greene, 2018)
Current
	•	The Current is a constant dialogue between our thoughts and reality. If we go into this process deeply enough, we come into contact with a theory that explains something far beyond the capability of our limited senses. (Greene, 2014)
Curve
Exponential curve
	•	exponential curve is special in mathematics because it reflects a function whose increase is proportional to its current value. (Smith and Smith, 2007).
Consumer
	•	The term ‘consumer’, even more than customer, implies a financial transaction with a supplier, buying a product or service for personal use. (Omand, 2014)
Customer centric doctrine
	•	The ‘customer centric’ doctrine borrowed from the commercial world has the great merit of emphasizing the need to delight the customer with prompt service (delight being of course an ironical term when the news is bad), and to provide material that adds value, as well as being prepared to listen carefully to customer feedback. (Omand, 2014)
Custom
	•	mais oubliez vous que c'est parmi les Catalans une loi sacrée de se marier entre eux  ?– Vous vous trompez, Fernand, ce n'est pas une loi, c'est une habitude, voilà tout ; et, croyez-moi, n'invoquez pas cette habitude en votre faveur. (Dumas, 1998)
Cybernetic framework
	•	a cybernetic framework offers a set of overall organizing categories that can be linked with other features of regulation. Accordingly, we start from a generic trio of compotent that can be found in any control system in nature or artifice, roughly corresponding with policy-making, monitoring, and enforcement or behabiour modification. (Hood et al., 2001)
	•	From such a perspective, any control system in art or nature must by definition contain a minimum of the three components depicted in the column axis of Table 2.1. There must be some capacity for standard-setting to allow a distinction to be made between more and less preferred states of the system. There must also be some capacity for information-gathering or monitoring to produce knowledge about current or changing states of the system. On top of that must be some capacity for behaviour- modification to change the state of the system. (Hood et al., 2001)
	•	If any of those components is absent, a system is not under control in a cybernetic sense. (Hood et al., 2001)
	•	Following the ‘law of requisite variety’ mentioned in the last chapter, each of the components must also have sufficient variety—different possible states—to match the variety of its environment if control in a cybernetic sense is to be achieved. (Hood et al., 2001)
	•	There must be some way of linking those three components together. (Hood et al., 2001)
	•	Cybernetics is a transdisciplinary approach for exploring regulatory systems, their structures, constraints and possibilities. (Reviews, 2016)
	•	Cybernetics was defined in the mid 20th century, by Nobert Wiener as ‘the scientific study of control and communication in the animal and the machine.’. (Reviews, 2016)
	•	Cybernetics is only applicable when the system being analysed is involved in a closed signal loop; that is, where action by the system causes some change in its environment and that change is fed to the system via information (feedback) that enables the system to change its behaviour. The ‘circular causal’ relationship is necessary and sufficient for a cybernetic perspective. (Reviews, 2016)
Cynisism
	•	According to Friedrich Nietzsche, “Man would rather have the void as purpose than be void of purpose.” Cynicism, the feeling that there is no purpose or meaning in life, is what we shall call having “the void as purpose.” In the world today, with growing disenchantment with politics and the belief systems of the past, this form of the false purpose is becoming increasingly common.Such cynicism involves some or all of the following beliefs: Life is absurd, meaningless, and random. Standards of truth, excellence, or meaning are completely old-fashioned. Everything is relative. People’s judgments are simply interpretations of the world, none better than another. All politicians are corrupt, so it’s not really worth it to get involved; better to abstain or choose a leader who will deliberately tear it all down. People who are successful get there through gaming the system. Any form of authority should be naturally mistrusted. Look behind people’s motives and you will see that they are selfish. Reality is quite brutal and ugly; better to accept this and be skeptical. It’s really hard to take anything so seriously; we should just laugh and have a good time. It’s all the same. (Greene, 2018)
	•	This attitude presents itself as cool and hip. Its adherents display a somewhat apathetic and sardonic air that gives them the appearance that they see through it all. But the attitude is not what it seems. Behind it is the adolescent pose of appearing to not care, which disguises a great fear of trying and failing, of standing out and being ridiculed. It stems from sheer laziness and offers its believers consolation for their lack of accomplishments. (Greene, 2018)
D
Danger
	•	on n'a pas besoin de connaître le danger pour craindre ; il y a même une chose à remarquer, c'est que ce sont justement les dangers inconnus qui inspirent les plus grandes terreurs. (Dumas, 1998)
Data
	•	we never actually have infinite data in real life. We need to take decisions (personal, political, ethical) on a finite database. Unlike what some people tend to think, having simply a vast number of events (yet a finite one) in the database is not enough to conclude that the computed probability is necessarily true. (Rosenberg, 2008)
Data analysis
	•	we analyze data to gain insights that could help us with smart decision- making. (Haider, 2016)
Holistic analysis
	•	In this approach to data analysis, the researcher examines the entire case (Yin, 2003) and presents description, themes, and interpretations or assertions related to the whole case. (Creswell, 2007)
Data-based process 
	•	A process is data-based to the degree that decisions are driven by data. Data- based processes help to make accountable decisions which are transparent, well-documented, and can be easily justified. (Vari, 1995)
Data collection
	•	[…] ‘data collection’ concerns the nature of the data. (Corbetta, 2003)
Data-gathering techniques
Observation
	•	Through observation, researchers analyse a given social phenomenon first of all by immersing themselves in it, so as to experience it from the inside and to be able to give direct description of it (Corbetta, 2003)
	•	By ‘observation’ we mean the principal technique for gathering data on non-verbal behaviour (Corbetta, 2003)
	•	Observation implies watching and listening. But at the same time this technique entails personal and intense contact between the subject who studies and the subject who is studied, a prolonged interaction that may even last years. (Corbetta, 2003)

Interview
	•	By means of interviews, they plumb the experiences, feelings and opinions of the subjects studied, in order to register their behaviour and motivations. (Corbetta, 2003) 

Structured interviews
	•	These are interviews in which all respondents are asked the same questions with the same wording and in the same sequence. The ‘stimulus’ is therefore the same for all respondents. Interviewees are, however, completely free to answer as they wish. (Corbetta, 2003)
	•	The structured interview is therefore a somewhat hybrid technique, in that it offers the standardization of information required by the ‘context of justification’, while remaining receptive to those unknown and unforeseen elements that belong to the ‘context of discovery’. (Corbetta, 2003)
	•	In the structured interview, the questions are predetermined both in content and in form. (Corbetta, 2003)

Semi-structured interviews
	•	When conductin a semi-structured interview, the interviewer makes reference to an ‘outline’ of the topics to be covered during the course of the conversation. The order in which the various topics are dealt with and the wording of the questions are left to the interviewer’s discretion. Within each topic, the interviewer is free to conduct the conversation as he thinks fit, to ask the questions he deems appropriate in the words he considers best, to give explanations and ask for clarification if the answer I not clear, to prompt the respondent to elucidate further if necessary, and to establish his own style of conversation. (Corbetta, 2003)
	•	This way of conducting the interview gives both the interviewer and the respondent ample freedom, while at the same time ensuring that all the relevant themes are deal with and all the necessary information collected. The interviewer’s guidelines draw the boundaries within which the interviewer is able to decide not only the order and the wording of the questions but also which themes to investigate in greater depth. While the interviewer will not generally tackle issues that are not laid down in the guidelines, he is nevertheless free to develop any themes arising during the course of the interview which he deemed important for a fuller understanding of the respondent even if these have not been raise in other interviews. This flexibility, albeit within a predetermined scheme, is not provided by the structured interview. (Corbetta, 2003) 
	•	In the semi-structured interview, the content, but not the form, of the questions is predetermined. (Corbetta, 2003)

Unstructured interviews
	•	[…] the unstructured interview, neither the content nor the form of the questions is predetermined, and may vary from one respondent to another. (Corbetta, 2003)
Open-ended interviews
	•	Open-ended interviews are best used in developmental work, such as improving the design of communications and structured evaluation procedures. (Bostrom et al., 1994)
	•	Knowing how people think about a topic can increase the chances of formulating test questions that will be understood as intended, tapping rather than shaping beliefs. (Bostrom et al., 1994)
	•	We believe that open-ended interviews come much closer than focus groups to simulating the actual conditions in which brochures are read. (Bostrom et al., 1994)

Intensive interview
	•	In intensive interviews it is possible to search, clarify and probe, effectively to ask why a story was told ‘that’ way (Riessman 1993: 2) (Davies et al., 2002)
	•	Intensive interviewing requires in-depth understanding that is best communicated through detailed examples and rich narratives. (Davies et al., 2002)
Document
	•	[…] the use of documents involves analysing a given social situation from the standpoint of the material – generally, but not solely, in written form – that the society has produced, and produces, both through individuals (autobiographical accounts, letters, etc.) and through institutions (news bulletins, the press, legal reports, etc.) (Corbetta, 2003)
	•	Documentary analysis is an analytical approach that is pertinent for all investigations, with benefits for all to grasp and weaknesses requiring caution from all. In particular, as argued in Chapter 2, research is strengthened by analytical triangulation, with documentary account providing one perspective from which to investigate research question. (Davies et al., 2002)
	•	Johnson and Joslyn (1995) see the second key advantage of documentary sources in the fact that they are non-reactive. (Davies et al., 2002)
	•	[…] a third potential advantage of documentary resources arises if they enable long time periods to be investigated. (Davies et al., 2002)
	•	[…] a fourth advantage of documentary analysis arises from the ability to use material to increase the size of researcher’s ‘sample’. (Davies et al., 2002)

Participant observation
	•	‘Participant observation’ combines observation as a tool for collecting social data and the full immersion of the researcher in the social reality studied (Corbetta, 2003)
	•	[…] by ‘participant observation’ we mean, rather than simple observation, the researcher’s direct involvement with the object studied (Corbetta, 2003)
	•	[…] it is the researcher’s involvement (participation) in the situation under investigation that constitutes the distinct element. The researcher not only observes the life of the subjects being studied, but also participates in it. (Corbetta, 2003)
	•	In participant observation the researcher ‘step into the field’ and immerses herself in the social context that she wants to study, lives like and with the people who are the object of the study, shares in their daily lives, asks them questions, discovers their hopes and pains, their worldviews and motivations, in order to develop that ‘vision from within’ that is the prerequisite of comprehension. (Corbetta, 2003)
	•	Participant observation can be applied to the study of all human activities and all groupings of human beings, above all – as has been said – if one wants to discover the worldview of others ‘from the inside’. (Corbetta, 2003)
	•	Participant observation emerges as a natural investigative tool when the researcher intends to study a situation in which he has taken (or takes) part himself, this giving rise to what has been called autobiographical sociology. (Corbetta, 2003)
	•	Participant observation has also been use to study political institutions (Corbetta, 2003)
	•	In participant observation, the researcher strives to identify with the subjects studied and thereby to see the world through their eyes. (Corbetta, 2003)
Data-mining
	•	Let’s begin with the discussion of what is meant by data mining. There are two divergent approaches to data mining. One is the traditionalist approach of considering data mining synonymous to statistical analysis. The other group insists that it differs from the traditional statistical analysis approach and leans toward unsupervised, machine-learning algorithms. I consider both approaches correct. The debate is somewhat superficial because it focuses on methods rather than the objectives. Data mining should be taken at its face value: an attempt to explore hitherto unknown trends and insights by subjecting data to analysis. The search for the “models” hidden in the data should not be restricted to certain methods. (Haider, 2016)
	•	Statistical methods rely on probability distributions whereas machine-learning methods are based on algorithms. Ultimately, the two approaches help us learn new facts about the phenomenon we study. The methods used should be flexible enough for us to discover not only what we are searching for, but also trends and facts that might not be on our radar. The known unknowns are rather easier to find than the unknown unknowns. Data mining should be equally good for both. (Haider, 2016)
	•	Ultimately, we analyze data to gain insights that could help us with smart decision- making. Fong and others (2002) offer a seven-step approach to data mining to support11smart decisions.1. Establish data mining goals 2. Select data3. Preprocess data4. Transform data5. Store data6. Mine data7. Evaluate data mining results. (Haider, 2016)
	•	The first step in data mining requires you to set up goals for the exercise. Obviously, you must identify the key questions that need to be answered. However, going beyond identifying the key questions are the concerns about the costs and benefits of the exercise. (Haider, 2016)
	•	Furthermore, you must determine, in advance, the expected level of accuracy and usefulness of the results obtained from data mining. If money were no object, you could throw as many funds as necessary to get the answers required. However, the cost benefit trade-off is always instrumental in determining the goals and scope of the data mining exercise. The level of the accuracy expected from the results also influences the costs. High levels of accuracy from data mining would cost more and vice versa. Furthermore, beyond a certain level of accuracy, you do not gain much from the exercise, given the diminishing returns. Thus, the cost benefit trade-offs for the desired level of accuracy are important considerations for data mining goals. (Haider, 2016)
	•	The output of a data mining exercise largely depends upon the quality of data being used. At times, data are readily available for further processing. (Haider, 2016)
	•	data may not be readily available for data mining. In such cases, you must identify other sources of data or even plan new data collection initiatives, including surveys. (Haider, 2016)
	•	The type of data, its size, and frequency of collection have a direct bearing on the cost of data mining exercise. Therefore, identifying the right kind of data needed for data mining that could answer the questions at reasonable costs is critical. (Haider, 2016)
	•	Preprocessing data is an important step in data mining. Often raw data are messy, containing erroneous or irrelevant data. In addition, even with relevant data, information is sometimes missing. In the preprocessing stage, you identify the irrelevant attributes of data and expunge such attributes from further consideration. At the same time, identifying the erroneous aspects of the data set and flagging them as such is necessary. For instance, human error might lead to inadvertent merging or incorrect parsing of information between columns. Data should be subject to checks to ensure integrity. Lastly, you must develop a formal method of dealing with missing data and determine whether the data are missing randomly or systematically. (Haider, 2016)
	•	After the relevant attributes of data have been retained, the next step is to determine the appropriate format in which data must be stored. An important consideration in data mining is to reduce the number of attributes needed to explain the phenomena. This may require transforming data. Data reduction algorithms, such as Principal Component Analysis (demonstrated and explained later in the chapter), can reduce the number of attributes without a significant loss in information. In addition, variables may need to be transformed to help explain the phenomenon being studied. (Haider, 2016)
	•	The transformed data must be stored in a format that makes it conducive for data mining. The data must be stored in a format that gives unrestricted and immediate read/write privileges to the data scientist. During data mining, new variables are created, which are written back to the original database, which is why the data storage scheme should facilitate efficiently reading from and writing to the database. (Haider, 2016)
	•	It is also important to store data on servers or storage media that keeps the data secure and also prevents the data mining algorithm from unnecessarily searching for pieces of data scattered on different servers or storage media. Data safety and privacy should be a prime concern for storing data. (Haider, 2016)
	•	After data is appropriately processed, transformed, and stored, it is subject to data mining. This step covers data analysis methods, including parametric and non-parametric methods, and machine-learning algorithms. (Haider, 2016)
	•	A good starting point for data mining is data visualization. Multidimensional views of the data using the advanced graphing capabilities of data mining software are very helpful in developing a preliminary understanding of the trends hidden in the data set. (Haider, 2016)
	•	After results have been extracted from data mining, you do a formal evaluation of the results. Formal evaluation could include testing the predictive capabilities of the models on observed data to see how effective and efficient the algorithms have been in reproducing data. This is known as an in-sample forecast. In addition, the results are shared with the key stakeholders for feedback, which is then incorporated in the later iterations of data mining to improve the process. (Haider, 2016)
	•	Data mining and evaluating the results becomes an iterative process such that the analysts use better and improved algorithms to improve the quality of results generated in light of the feedback received from the key stakeholders. (Haider, 2016)
	•	data mining with networks also creates ethical problems related to privacy and to their use by the military. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
Data reduction algorithms 
	•	Data reduction algorithms, such as Principal Component Analysis (demonstrated and explained later in the chapter), can reduce the number of attributes without a significant loss in information. (Haider, 2016)
Data science
	•	In the times of big data, a question as simple as, “What is data science?” can result in many answers. In some cases, the diversity of opinion on these answers borders on hostility. (Haider, 2016)
	•	I define data science as something that data scientists do. (Haider, 2016)
	•	If analytics and data science were important 20 years ago, they are now the distinguishing factor successful firms who increasingly compete on analytics. (Haider, 2016)
	•	The strength of data science lies in the power of the narrative. (Haider, 2016)
	•	Data science will not be the exclusive dominion of computer scientists/engineers and statisticians. Millions trained or schooled in other disciplines will embrace data science and analytics to contribute to evidence-based planning in their respective fields. As millions will make the transition to data science, they will have to start somewhere. (Haider, 2016)
	•	I believe data science and analytics are as much about storytelling as they are about algorithms. The ability to build a strong narrative from your empirical findings and then communicating it to the stakeholders will distinguish accomplished data scientists from those who would prefer to remain confined to coding and number crunching. (Haider, 2016)
	•	This book makes a concerted effort to establish data science as an emerging field where data, analytics, and narrative blend to give life to stories that will help devise winning strategies in business, government, and not-for-profit sectors. (Haider, 2016)
Data scientist
	•	I define data scientist as someone who finds solutions to problems by analyzing big or small data using appropriate tools and then tells stories to communicate her findings to the relevant stakeholders. (Haider, 2016) 
	•	I do not use the data size as a restrictive clause. A data below a certain arbitrary threshold does not make one less of a data scientist. Nor is my definition of a data scientist restricted to particular analytic tools, such as machine learning. As long as one has a curious mind, fluency in analytics, and the ability to communicate the findings, I consider the person a data scientist. (Haider, 2016)
	•	I define data science as something that data scientists do. (Haider, 2016)
	•	Recall Dr. Patil told the Guardian newspaper in 2012 that a “data scientist is that unique blend of skills that can both unlock the insights of data and tell a fantastic story via the data.” (Haider, 2016)
	•	The other key ingredient for a successful data scientist is a behavioral trait: curiosity. A data scientist has to be one with a very curious mind, willing to spend significant time and effort to explore her hunches. (Haider, 2016)
	•	In journalism, the editors call it having the nose for news. Not all reporters know where the news lies. Only those who have the nose for news get the story. Curiosity is equally important for data scientists as it is for journalists. (Haider, 2016)
	•	Dr. Schutt defined a data scientist as someone who is part computer scientist, part software engineer, and part statistician (Miller, 2013). But that’s the definition of an average data scientist. “The best,” she contended, “tend to be really curious people, thinkers who ask good questions and are O.K. dealing with unstructured situations and trying to find structure in them.” (Haider, 2016) 
	•	I believe that unless a data scientist is willing to tell the story, she will remain in a back office job where others will use her analytics and findings to build the narrative and receive praise, and in time, promotions. Storytelling is, in fact, the final and most important stage of analytics. Therefore, successful communication of findings to stakeholders is as important as conducting robust analytics. (Haider, 2016)
	•	My definition is rather simple and straightforward. If you analyze data to find solutions to problems and are able to tell a compelling story from your findings, you are a data scientist. (Haider, 2016)
	•	Analytics summarize findings in tables and plots. The data scientist should then use the insights to build the narrative to communicate the findings. (Haider, 2016)
	•	As a data scientist, you are expected to do a thorough analysis with the appropriate data, deploying the appropriate tools. As a writer, you are responsible for communicating your findings to the readers. (Haider, 2016)
Death
	•	Deaths are normally measured as fatalities due ot an event, mortality rate (deaths per unit population), and frequencies (deaths per unit time). (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Death is one of the severest human returns, but a focus on deaths can underestimate other returns, such as injuries, disabilities, loss of life expectancy, psychological stress, health costs, and injustices. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Injuries, like deaths, have economic value in the tort system and health system. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Most of us spend our lives avoiding the thought of death. Instead, the inevitability of death should be continually on our minds. Understanding the shortness of life fills us with a sense of purpose and urgency to realize our goals. Training ourselves to confront and accept this reality makes it easier to manage the inevitable setbacks, separations, and crises in life. It gives us a sense of proportion, of what really matters in this brief existence of ours. Most people continually look for ways to separate themselves from others and feel superior. Instead, we must see the mortality in everyone, how it equalizes and connects us all. By becoming deeply aware of our mortality, we intensify our experience of every aspect of life. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Our avoidance of the thought of death has established our pattern for handling other unpleasant realities and adversity. We easily become hysterical and lose our balance, blaming others for our fate, feeling angry and sorry for ourselves, or we opt for distractions andquick ways to dull the pain. This becomes a habit we cannot shake, and we tend to feel the generalized anxiety and emptiness that come from all this avoidance. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Before this becomes a lifelong pattern, we must shake ourselves out of this dreamlike state in a real and lasting way. We must come to look at our own mortality without flinching, and without fooling ourselves with some fleeting, abstract meditation on death. We must focus hard on the uncertainty that death represents—it could come tomorrow, as could other adversity or separation. We must stop postponing our awareness. We need to stop feeling superior and special, seeing that death is a fate shared by us all and something that should bind us in a deeply empathetic way. We are all a part of the brotherhood and sisterhood of death. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Making death a familiar presence, we understand how short life is and what really should matter to us. We feel a sense of urgency and deeper commitment to our work and relationships. When we face a crisis, separation, or illness, we do not feel so terrified and overwhelmed. We don’t feel the need to go into avoidance mode. We can accept that life involves pain and suffering, and we use such moments to strengthen ourselves and to learn. (Greene, 2018)
	•	the awareness of our mortality cleanses us of silly illusions and intensifies every aspect of our experience. (Greene, 2018)
	•	In the past, death was a daily and visceral presence in cities and towns, something hard to escape. By a certain age, most people had seen firsthand the deaths of others. Today, in many parts of the world,we have made death largely invisible, something that occurs only in hospitals. (We have done something similar to the animals that we eat.) We can pass through most of life without ever physically witnessing what happens. This gives a rather unreal aspect to what is so profoundly a part of life. This unreality is enhanced in the entertainment we consume, in which death is made to seem rather cartoonish, with dozens of people dying violent deaths without any attendant emotion except excitement at the imagery on the screen. This reveals how deep the need is to repress the awareness and desensitize ourselves to the fear.Furthermore, we have recently come to venerate youth, to create a virtual cult around it. Objects that have aged, films from the past unconsciously remind us of the shortness of life and the fate that awaits us. We find ways to avoid them, to surround ourselves with what is new, fresh, and trending. Some people have even come to entertain the idea that through technology we can somehow overcome death itself, the ultimate in human denial. In general, technology gives us the feeling that we have such godlike powers that we can prolong life and ignore the reality for quite a long time. In this sense, we are no stronger than our most primitive ancestors. We have simply found new ways to delude ourselves. (Greene, 2018)
	•	By connecting to the reality of death, we connect more profoundly to the reality and fullness of life. By separating death from life and repressing our awareness of it, we do the opposite. (Greene, 2018)
	•	The problem for us humans is that we are aware of our mortality, but we are afraid to take this awareness further. (Greene, 2018)
	•	The proximity of death suddenly snaps us to attention as our whole body responds to the threat. We feel the rush of adrenaline, the blood pumping extra hard to the brain and through the nervous system. This focuses the mind to a much higher level and wenotice new details, see people’s faces in a new light, and sense the impermanence in everything around us, deepening our emotional responses. This effect can linger for years, even decades. (Greene, 2018)
	•	we can say that the specter of death is what impels us toward our fellow humans and makes us avid for love. Death and love are inextricably interconnected. The ultimate separation anddisintegration represented by death drive us to unite and integrate ourselves with others. Our unique consciousness of death has created our particular form of love. And through a deepening of our death awareness we will only strengthen this impulse, and rid ourselves of the divisions and lifeless separations that afflict humanity. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Think of death as a kind of threshold we all must cross. As such, it represents the ultimate mystery. We cannot possibly find the words or concepts to express what it is. We confront something that is truly unknowable. No amount of science or technology or expertise can solve this riddle or verbalize it. We humans can fool ourselves that we know just about everything, but at this threshold we are finally left dumb and groping.This confrontation with something we cannot know or verbalize is what we shall call the Sublime, whose Latin root means “up to the threshold.” The Sublime is anything that exceeds our capacity for words or concepts by being too large, too vast, too dark and mysterious. And when we face such things, we feel a touch of fear but also awe and wonder. We are reminded of our smallness, of what is much vaster and more powerful than our puny will. Feeling theSublime is the perfect antidote to our complacency and to the petty concerns of daily life that can consume us and leave us feeling rather empty.The model for feeling the Sublime comes in our meditation on mortality, but we can train our minds to experience it through other thoughts and actions. For instance, when we look up at the night sky, we can let our minds try to fathom the infinity of space and the overwhelming smallness of our planet, lost in all the darkness. We can encounter the Sublime by thinking about the origin of life on earth, how many billions of years ago this occurred, perhaps at some particular moment, and how unlikely it was, considering the thousands of factors that had to converge for the experiment of life to begin on this planet. Such vast amounts of time and the actual origin of life exceed our capacity to conceptualize them, and we are left with a sensation of the Sublime. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Since the beginning of human consciousness, our awareness of death has terrified us. This terror has shaped our beliefs, our religions, our institutions, and so much of our behavior in ways we cannot see or understand. We humans have become the slaves to our fears and our evasions. (Greene, 2018)
	•	When we turn this around, becoming more aware of our mortality, we experience a taste of true freedom. We no longer feel the need to restrict what we think and do, in order to make life predictable. We can be more daring without feeling afraid of the consequences. We can cut loose from all the illusions and addictions that we employ to numb our anxiety. We can commit fully to our work, to our relationships, to all our actions. And once we experience some of this freedom, we will want to explore further and expand our possibilities as far as time will allow us. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Immobilized in the falsified center of the movement of its world, the consciousness of the spectator no longer knows in its l ife a passage towards its rea l ization and towards its death. Whoever has renounced the expenditure of his life can no longer admit his death. (Debord, 2012)
	•	dans la mort était, sinon le repos, du moins l'insensibilité qui lui ressemble. (Dumas, 1998)
Death denial
	•	Some people have even come to entertain the idea that through technology we can somehow overcome death itself, the ultimate in human denial. In general, technology gives us the feeling that we have such godlike powers that we can prolong life and ignore the reality for quite a long time. In this sense, we are no stronger than our most primitive ancestors. We have simply found new ways to delude ourselves. (Greene, 2018)
Paradoxical death effect
	•	If we consider death as the crossing of a threshold that terrifies us in general, the experiences enumerated above are intimations of our own death in smaller doses. Separating from people we know, traveling in a strange land, clearly entering some new phase of life, all involve changes that cause us to look back at the past as if a part of us has died. In such moments, and during the more intense forms of grief from actual deaths, we notice a heightening of the senses and a deepening of our emotions. Thoughts of a different order come to us. We are more attentive. We can say that our experience of life is qualitatively different and charged, as if we temporarily became someone else. Of course, this alteration in our thinking, feeling, and senses will bestrongest if we ourselves survive a brush with death. Nothing seems the same after such an experience. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Let us call this the paradoxical death effect—these moments and encounters have the paradoxical result of making us feel more awake and alive. We can explain the paradoxical effect in the following way. (Greene, 2018)
	•	As a corollary to all this, we find hardly anyone willing to discuss the subject as a personal reality we all face, and how we might manage it in a healthier manner. The subject is simply taboo. And by a law of human nature, when we go so far in our denial, the paradoxical effect takes hold of us in the negative direction, making our life more constrained and deathlike.We became aware of our mortality quite early on in childhood, and this filled us with an anxiety that we cannot remember but that was very real and visceral. Such anxiety cannot be wished away or denied. It sits in us as adults in a powerfully latent form. When we choose to repress the thought of death, our anxiety is only made stronger by our not confronting the source of it. The slightest incident or uncertainty about the future will tend to stir up this anxiety and even make it chronic. To fight this, we will tend to narrow down the scope of our thoughts and activities; if we don’t leave our comfort zones in what we think and do, then we can make life rather predictable and feel less vulnerable to anxiety. Certain addictions to foods or stimulants or forms of entertainment will have a similar dulling effect.If we take this far enough, we become increasingly self-absorbed and less dependent on people, who often stir up our anxieties with their unpredictable behavior. (Greene, 2018)
	•	We can describe the contrast between life and death in the following manner: Death is absolute stillness, without movement or change except decay. In death we are separated from others and completely alone. Life on the other hand is movement, connection to other living things, and diversity of life forms. By denying and repressing the thought of death, we feed our anxieties and become more deathlike from within—separated from other people, our thinking habitual and repetitive, with little overall movement and change. On the other hand, the familiarity and closeness with death, the ability to confront the thought of it has the paradoxical effect of making us feel more alive, as the story of Flannery O’Connor well illustrates.  (Greene, 2018)
Death of expertise
	•	Never have so many people had so much access to so much knowledge and yet have been so resistant to learning anything. (Nichols, 2017)
	•	ot only do increasing numbers of lay-people lack basic knowledge, they reject fundamental rules of evidence and refuse to learn how to make a logical argument.
	•	is is more than a natural skepticism toward experts. (Nichols, 2017)
	•	A acks on established knowledge and the subsequent rash of poor information in the general public are sometimes amusing. (Nichols, 2017)
	•	By the “death of expertise,” I do not mean the death of actual expert abilities, the knowledge of speci c things that sets some people apart from others in various areas.  ere will always be doctors and diplomats, lawyers and engineers, and many other specialists in various  elds. On a day-to-day basis, the world cannot function without them. (Nichols, 2017)
	•	is, however, is a reliance on experts as technicians. It is not a dialogue between experts and the larger community, but the use of established knowledge as an o -the-shelf convenience as needed and only so far as desired. (Nichols, 2017)
	•	On the other hand, many experts, and particularly those in the academy, have abandoned their duty to engage with the public.  They have retreated into jargon and irrelevance, preferring to interact with each other only. Meanwhile, the people holding the middle ground to whom we o en refer as “public intellectuals”—I’d like to think I’m one of them—are becoming as frustrated and polarized as the rest of society. (Nichols, 2017)
	•	The death of expertise is not just a rejection of existing knowledge. It is fundamentally a rejection of science and dispassionate rational- ity, which are the foundations of modern civilization. It is a sign, as the art critic Robert Hughes once described late twentieth-century America, of “a polity obsessed with therapies and  lled with distrust of formal politics,” chronically “skeptical of authority” and “prey to superstition.” (Nichols, 2017)
	•	Americans now believe that having equal rights in a political system also means that each person’s opinion about any- thing must be accepted as equal to anyone else’s. (Nichols, 2017)
De-attenuation
	•	De-attenuation is not quite equivalent to amplification because it can be a process of pulling the image of the risk back from a low level but not reaching the point at which it started. (Breakwell, 2014)
Decentralization
	•	Aggregation, he adds, is central to successful decentralization. (Coker, 2009)
	•	Decentralization is a great strength in that it encourages independent specialization on the one hand, whilst still allow- ing people to co-ordinate their activities and solve problems on the other (Surowiecki 2005:171). (Coker, 2009)
	•	Decentralization, however, can also be a weakness in that there is no guarantee that valuable information which is uncovered in one part of the system will find its way through to the other parts. (Coker, 2009)
Decentralized system
	•	A decentralized system can only produce genuinely intelligent results if there is a means of aggregating the information to everyone in the system. (Coker, 2009)
	•	One advantage of a decentralized or distributed system is that it offers an incentive to share information. It creates an incentive for soldiers ‘at the edge’ to come up with the right solution because there are no bureaucratic filters or political factors that are likely to influence the processing of information. (Coker, 2009)
Decentralization of decision-making 
	•	Decentralization of decision-making authority to individuals close to the operations may well be necessary to produce appropriate low-level responses to unanticipated event in systems that display high degrees of interactive complexity (Sagan, 1995)
	•	Perrow also argues that characteristics of highly centralized decision-making – strict standard operating procedures, unquestioned individual obedience, and immediate response – are equally necessary in tightly coupled systems. (Sagan, 1995)
	•	Decentralized decision-making does not necessarily enhance safety because tightly coupled systems require rapid response and strict adherence to standard operation procedures. (Sagan, 1995)
Deception
	•	Deception, in contrast, is where an individual purposely takes steps that are designed to prevent others from knowing the full truth—as that individual understands it—about a particular matter. The deliberate aim, in other words, is not to provide a straightforward or comprehensive description of events (Mearsheimer, 2013)
	•	lying, spinning, and withholding information are all forms of deception, and all three can be contrasted with truth telling. (Mearsheimer, 2013)
	•	analysts often reject the possibility of deception because they see no evidence of it.  (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Rejecting a plausible but unproven hypothesis too early tends to bias the subsequent analysis, because one does not then look for the evidence that might support it. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	The possibility of deception should not be rejected until it is disproved or, at least, until a systematic search for evidence has been made and none has been found. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	instances in which deception occurred are easier to recall than instances in which it did not. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Deception is fairly easy, and the knowledge that it is possible degrades the value of accurate information, as we will see in the Iraq case. (Jervis, 2010)
	•	Almost by definition, finding deception is very difficult, and searching for it can be corrosive because it leads to downgrading much valid and valuable information. (Jervis, 2010)
	•	In international politics, furthermore, deception is rampant. Adversaries usually wish to mislead others about at least some aspect of what they can and will do. (Beebe and Pherson, 2012)
	•	Deception sometimes adds to and sometimes competes with the enormous amount of misleading information that is generated in the natural couse of evets – the “noise” that disguises “signals” to use Wohlstetter’s terms. (Beebe and Pherson, 2012)
	•	with deception keep in mind that there is always a scale involved. At the bottom of the scale we find the most harmless varieties, little white lies. These could include all forms of flattery in daily life: “You look great today”; “I loved your screenplay.” They could include not revealing to people exactly what you did that day or withholding bits of information because it is annoying to be completely transparent and have no privacy. These small forms of deception can be detected if we pay attention, such as by noticing the genuineness of a smile. But in fact it is best to simply ignore this lower end. Polite, civilized society depends on the ability to say things that are not always sincere. It would be too damaging socially to become constantly aware of this subrealm of deception. Save your alertness for those situations in which the stakes are higher and people might be angling to get something valuable out of you. (Greene, 2018)

Concealment
	•	concealment, which involves withholding information that might undermine or weaken one's position. (Mearsheimer, 2013)
	•	the individual simply remains silent about the evidence, because he wants to hide it from others. (Mearsheimer, 2013)
Liar
	•	purposely leading the listener to a false conclusion without explicitly stating that conclusion. (Mearsheimer, 2013)
	•	Liars make false assertions in ways that are designed not to raise any doubts about the truthfulness of their claims (Mearsheimer, 2013)
	•	Skillful liars present false assertions with an air of certainty that makes it especially difficult for the target audience to figure out that it is being bamboozled. (Mearsheimer, 2013)

Lie
	•	A lie is a positive action designed to deceive the target audience. (Mearsheimer, 2013)
Lying
	•	Lying is when a person makes a statement that he knows or suspects to be false in the hope that others will think it is true. (Mearsheimer, 2013)
	•	Lying can involve making up facts that one knows to be false or denying facts that one knows to be true (Mearsheimer, 2013)
	•	involve the disingenuous arrangement of facts to tell a fictitious story. (Mearsheimer, 2013)
	•	imply that something is true, when he knows that it is not true. (Mearsheimer, 2013)
	•	Lying, as emphasized, is usually considered deplorable behavior, whereas most people seem to believe that it is acceptable to spin and conceal, even though these behaviors are designed to deceive (Mearsheimer, 2013)
	•	Lying, as emphasized, is usually considered deplorable behavior, whereas most people seem to believe that it is acceptable to spin and conceal, even though these behaviors are designed to deceive (Mearsheimer, 2013)

Spinning
	•	Spinning is when a person telling a story emphasizes certain facts and links them together in ways that play to his advantage, while, at the same time, downplaying or ignoring inconvenient facts. (Mearsheimer, 2013)
	•	Spinning is all about interpreting the known facts in a way that allows the spinner to tell a favorable story (Mearsheimer, 2013)
	•	no attempt is made to render a completely accurate account of events. (Mearsheimer, 2013)
	•	The basic story being told is distorted, but the facts are not put together so as to tell a false story, which would be a lie (Mearsheimer, 2013)
	•	Spinning is exaggeration or distortion, not prevarication. (Mearsheimer, 2013)
	•	spinning, however, the listeners are much more likely to be able to recognize that they are not getting a complete and accurate picture, and then rectify the problem by filling in the missing pieces of the story. (Mearsheimer, 2013)

Deliberate deception
	•	Even the problem of deliberate deception is not unique to intelligence analysis. (Weiss, 2008)
Deceiver
	•	We humans are by nature quite gullible. We want to believe in certain things—that we can get something for nothing; that we can easily regain or rejuvenate our health thanks to some new trick, perhaps even cheat death; that most people are essentially good and can be trusted. This propensity is what deceivers and manipulators thrive on. (Greene, 2018)
	•	The most clear and common sign comes when people assume an extra-animated front. When they smile a lot, seem more than friendly, and even are quite entertaining, it is hard for us to not be drawn in and lower ever so slightly our resistance to their influence. (Greene, 2018)
	•	if people are trying to cover something up, they tend to become extra vehement, righteous, and chatty. They are playing on the conviction bias (see chapter 1)—if I deny or say something with so much gusto, with an air of being a victim, it is hard to doubt me. We tend to take extra conviction for truth. In fact, when people try to explain their ideas with so much exaggerated energy, or defend themselves with an intense level of denial, that is precisely when you should raise your antennae. (Greene, 2018)
	•	the cover-up and the soft sell—the deceiver is striving to distract you from the truth. Although an animated face and gestures might come from sheer exuberance and genuine friendliness, when they come from someone you don’t know well, or from someone who just might have something to hide, you must be on your guard. Now you are looking for nonverbal signs to confirm your suspicions. (Greene, 2018)
	•	With such deceivers you will often notice that one part of the face or the body is more expressive to attract your attention. This will often be the area around the mouth, with large smiles and changing expressions. This is the easiest area of the body for people to manipulate and create an animated effect. But it could also be exaggerated gestures with the hands and arms. The key is that you will detect tension and anxiety in other parts of the body, because it is impossible for them to control all of the muscles. When they flash a big smile, the eyes are tense with little movement or the rest of the body is unusually still, or if the eyes are trying to fool you with looks to garner your sympathy, the mouth quivers slightly. These are signs of contrived behavior, of trying too hard to control one part of the body. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Sometimes really clever deceivers will attempt to create the opposite impression. If they are covering up a misdeed, they will hide their guilt behind an extremely serious and competent exterior, the face becoming unusually still. Instead of loud denials, they will offer a highly plausible explanation of the chain of events, even going through the “evidence” that confirms this. Their picture of reality is nearly seamless. If they are trying to gain your money or support, they will pose as the highly competent professional, to the point of being somewhat boring, even hitting you with a lot of numbers and statistics. (Greene, 2018)
	•	the best thing to do when you suspect people of trying to distract you from the truth is not to actively confront them in the beginning, but in fact to encourage them to continue by showing interest in what they are saying or doing. You want them to talk more, to reveal more signs of tension and contrivance. At the right moment you must surprise them with a question or remark that is designed to make them uncomfortable, revealing you are onto them. Pay attention to the microexpressions and body language they emit at such moments. If they are really deceiving, they will often have a freeze response as they take this in, and then quickly try to mask the underlying anxiety. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Even with the most practiced deceivers, one of the best ways to unmask them is to notice how they give emphasis to their words through nonverbal cues. It is very difficult for humans to fake this. Emphasis comes through raised vocal pitch and assertive tone, forceful hand gestures, the raising of eyebrows and the widening of eyes. We might also lean forward or rise up on the balls of our feet. We engage in such behavior when we are filled with emotion and trying to add an exclamation point to what we are saying. It is hard for deceivers to mimic this. The emphasis they place with their voice or body is not exactly correlated to what they are saying, does not quite fit the context of the moment, or comes a little too late. When they pound the table with their fist, it is not at the moment they should be feeling the emotion, but a little earlier, as if on cue, as if to create an effect. These are all cracks in the veneer of the realness they are trying to project. (Greene, 2018)

Decision
Conscious decision
	•	unlike animals, with their instincts to guide them past dangers, we humans have to rely upon our conscious decisions. (Greene, 2018)
Decision-makers
	•	Decision-makers facing uncertainties do not work in a ‘choiceless’ environment, events result from their action or inactions (Roberts, 2001a)
	•	Decision makers need a realistic assessment of the costs and benefits of a proposal before making the final decision to approve it. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	Decision makers who are prone to narrow framing construct a preference every time they face a risky choice. They would do better by having a risk policy that they routinely apply whenever a relevant problem arises. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	A rational decision maker is interested only in the future consequences of current investments (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	Because decisions are defined by decision makers’ goals, as well as by their circumstances, different scientific facts may be relevant to different decision makers. (Fischhoff, 2013)
	•	The decision-makers need to see beyond the risk evaluations, as they may put different weights on the uncertainties than the experts do, and they may also need to take other issues into account, (Aven, 2014)
	•	Just like the expert’s considerations, the decision-maker’s review and judgment is based on a combination of factual and value-based considerations (Aven and Hansson 2013). (Aven, 2014)
	•	Because it is the job of decision makers to make decisions, they cannot react to ambiguity by deferring judgment. (Betts, 2007)
	•	Decision-makers are buried by both information and tasks. (Fishbein and Treverton, 2004)
	•	Decisionmakers tend to be aggressive political leaders who attain their positions through decisiveness and action. In their decisionmaking processes, they are constantly seeking to reduce ambiguities and resolve contradictory pieces of information to fit the "policy puzzle." (Stack, 1997)
	•	Because decisionmakers do not have the time nor analytical staff to study these issues and prepare reports, they must rely on intelligence community expertise. (Stack, 1997)
Security decision maker
	•	This book uses the term security decision maker largely to refer to anyone responsible for making decisions relating to security. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	Only rarely do security decision makers have accurate knowledge of a specific threat beforehand. Information may be incomplete or vague, and as such, edu- cated judgments must be made in defining a threat. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	security decision makers should endeavor to seek out all possible sources of threat information. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	Security decision makers should review this information on a regular basis while looking for trends and patterns that might indicate existing threats or that might point to a vulnerability that can be solved with remedial measures. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	Security decision makers should keep abreast of the latest threat information using the best available sources of information. Using the threat information sources discussed above and adding to them where possible will help keep the security professional abreast of the latest threats and ensure that the assessment report is up to date. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	Security decision makers, depending on the nature of the organizations they protect, can keep abreast of the latest tactics and methods of their most common adversaries. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	By effectively blocking opportunities, security decision makers can mitigate threats and reduce risk. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	Security decision makers should take full advantage of security policies and procedures, if not for their low cost to implement, but also their ability to reduce liability and control other aspects of the security program. (Vellani, 2007)
Political decision maker
	•	political decision makers and bureaucrats are uncomfortable with explicit theory because the hard knocks of experience have made them distrust abstraction and because they are responsible for getting concrete results. (Betts, 2007)
Decision-making
	•	Decision-making is ordinarily formalized as a means-ends relationship: means are conceived to be evaluated and chosen in the light of ends finally selected independently of and prior to the choice of means. This is the means-ends relationship of the root method. (Lindblom, 1959)
	•	The public generally assumes that the decision-making process is based on a rational analysis of social benefit and social risk. While it often is, we have all seen after-the-fact examples of irrationality (Starr, 1969)
	•	Each decision-making process has two major aspects: what and whom to include on the one hand and what and how to select (closure) on the other (Hajer and Wagenaar, 2003; Stirling, 2004). Inclusion and selection are therefore the two essential parts of any decision- or policy-making activity. (Renn, 2007b)
	•	Classic decision analysis still offers formal methods for generating options and evalu- ating these options against a set of predefined criteria. With the advent of new participatory methods, however, the two issues of inclusion and selection have become more complex and sophisticated than purported in these conventional methods. (Renn, 2007b)
	•	we never actually have infinite data in real life. We need to take decisions (personal, political, ethical) on a finite database. Unlike what some people tend to think, having simply a vast number of events (yet a finite one) in the database is not enough to conclude that the computed probability is necessarily true. (Rosenberg, 2008)
	•	Decision making and decision analysis are large and diverse fields of study and research. (Heuer and Pherson, 2011)
	•	All difficult decisions are made under uncertainty; understanding chaos has helped us to provide better decision support. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
Inclusive governance
	•	First and foremost this means that the four major actors in risk decision-making – political, business, scientific and civil society players – should jointly engage in the process of framing the problem, generating options, evaluating options and coming to a joint conclusion. (Renn, 2007b)
	•	Inclusive governance also needs to address the second part of the decision- making process – reaching closure on a set of options that are selected for further consideration, while others are rejected. Closure here does not mean the final word on a development, risk reduction plan or regulation; rather it represents the product of a deliberation, the agreement that the participants reached. The problem is that the more actors, viewpoints, interests and values are included and thus represented in an arena, the more difficult it is to reach either a consensus or some other kind of joint agreement. (Renn, 2007b)
Narrow framing
	•	narrow framing: a sequence of two simple decisions, considered separately
 (Kahneman, 2012)
Broad framing
	•	broad framing: a single comprehensive decision, with four options  (Kahneman, 2012)
Allied decision-making
	•	risk has become the organizing principle for allied decisionmaking. (Coker, 2009)
	•	isk is not only conceived as something which the Alliance must address, such as the next state to collapse, or the next one found to be sponsoring terrorism. It has also become a method for regulating its own activities. (Coker, 2009)
Decision support
	•	Managers, commanders, planners, and other decision makers all make choices or tradeoofs among competing goals, values, or preferences. Because of limitations in human short-term memory, we usually cannot keep all the pros and cons of multiple potions in mind at the same time. That causes us to focus first on one set of problems or opportunities and then another, a situation that often leads to vacillation or procrastination in making a firm decision. (Heuer and Pherson, 2011)
	•	Some decision-support techniques help overcome this cognitive limitation by laying out all the options and interrelationships in graphic form so that analysts  can test the results of alternative options while still keeping the problem as a whole in view. (Heuer and Pherson, 2011)
	•	Other techniques helpd decision makers untangle the complexity of a situation or define the opportunities and constraints in the environment in which the choice needs to be made. (Heuer and Pherson, 2011)
	•	Intelligence analysts can and should use decision-support techniques to provide timely support to managers, commanders, planners, and decision makers who do make these choices. (Heuer and Pherson, 2011)
	•	To engage in this type of customer support analysis, analysts must understand the operating environment of the decision maker and anticipate how the decision maker is likely to approach an issue. They must understand the dynamics of the decision-making process in order to recognize when and how they can be most useful. (Heuer and Pherson, 2011)
	•	By using such techniques, analysts can see a problem from the decision maker’s perspective. They can use theses techniques without overstepping the limits of their role as intelligence aanalysts because the technique doesn’t make the decision; t just structures all the relevant information in a format that makes it easier for the manager, commander, planner, or other decision maker to make a choice. (Heuer and Pherson, 2011)
	•	The decision aids described in this capter also provide a framework for analysing why or how and individual leader, group, organization, or country has made or is likely to make a decision. If an analyst can describe an adversary’s or a competitor’s goals and preferences, it may be easier to foresee their decision. Similarly, when the decisions are known, the technique makes it easier to infer the competitor’s or adversary’s goals and preferences. (Heuer and Pherson, 2011)
	•	Instead of trying to predict a foreign organization or goernment’s decision, an analyst will often find that the best course is to use one or more of these decision-support techniques to describe the forces that are expected to shape the decision, identify several potential outcomes, and then select indicators or signs to look for that would provide early warning of the direction in which events are headed. (Heuer and Pherson, 2011)
Decision support systems
	•	in diagnosis systems, decision support systems, help desk applications, design, processing planning, image recognition, navigation planning, product customization, imagery and intelligent tutoring systems. (Işıklar et al., 2007)
	•	A decision support system (DSS) is a computerised information system which contains domain-specific knowledge and analytical decision models to assist the decision maker by presenting information and the interpretation of various alternatives. (Yam et al., 2001)
	•	A DSS is intended to enhance individual decision making by providing easier access to problem recognition, problem structure, information management, statistical tools, and the application of knowledge. (Yam et al., 2001)
	•	Such a system is designed to enable the easier and faster generation of alternatives, and to increase the awareness of deficiencies in the decision-making process. It can help the decision maker to make more effective and efficient decisions in complex situations. (Yam et al., 2001)
Decision support tool
	•	decision support tools including formal methods of reasoning and probabilistic models are of noteworthy helpfulness. (Blecic et al., 2007)
Complexity Manager
	•	Complexity Manager is a simplified approach to understanding complex systems – the kind of systems in which many variables are related to each other and may be changing over time. (Heuer and Pherson, 2011)
	•	Government policy decisions are often aimed at changing a dynamically complex system. It is because of this dynamic complexity that many policies fail to meet their goals or have unforeseen and unintended consequences. (Heuer and Pherson, 2011)
	•	Use Complexity Manager to assess the chances for success or failure of a new or proposed policy, identify opportunities for influencing the outcome of any situation, determine what would need to change in order to achieve a specified goal, or identify potential unintended consequences from the pursuit of a policy. (Heuer and Pherson, 2011)
Decision matrix
	•	Decision Matrix is a simple but powerful device for making tradeoffs between conflicting goals or preferences. (Heuer and Pherson, 2011)
	•	An analyst lists the decision options or possible choices, the criteria for judging the options, the weights assigned to each of these criteria, and an evaluation of the exetnet to which each option satisfies each of the criteria. This process will show the best choice – based on the values the analyst or a decision maker puts into the matrix. (Heuer and Pherson, 2011)
	•	By studying the matrix, one can also analyse how the best choice would change if the values assigned to the selection criteria were changed or if the ability of an option to satisfy a specific criterion were changed. It is almost impossible for an analyst to keep track of these factors effectively without such a matrix, as one cannot keep all the pros and cons in working memory at the same time. (Heuer and Pherson, 2011)
	•	A Decision Matrix helps the analsyst see the whole picture. (Heuer and Pherson, 2011)
Force Field Analysis
	•	Force Field Analysis is a technique that analysts can use to help a decision maker decide how to solve a problem or achieve a goal, or to determine whether it is possible to do so. (Heuer and Pherson, 2011)
	•	The analyst identifies and assigns weights to the relative importance of all the factors or dforces that are either a help or a hindrance in solving the problem or achieving the goal. After organizing all these factors in two lists, pro and con, with a weighted value for each factor, the analyst or decision maker is in a better position to recommend strategies that would be most effective in either strengthening the impact of the driving forces or reducing the impact of the restraining forces. (Heuer and Pherson, 2011)
Pros-Cons-Faults-and-Fixes
	•	Pros-Cons-Faults-and-Fixes is a strategy for critiquing new policy ideas. (Heuer and Pherson, 2011)
	•	It is intended to offset the human tendancy of analysts and decision makers to jumps to conclusions before conducting a full analysis of a problem, as often happens in group meetings. (Heuer and Pherson, 2011)
	•	The first step is for the analyst or the project team to make lists of Pros and Cons. If the analyst or team is concerned that people are being unduly negative about an idea, he or she looks for ways to “Fix” the Cons, that is, to explain why the Cons are unimportant or even to transform them into Pros. If concerned that people are jumping on the band wagon too quicly, the analyst tries to “Fault” the Pros by exploring how they could go wrong. The analyst can also do both Pros and Cons. (Heuer and Pherson, 2011)
SWOT Analysis
	•	Swot analysis is used to develop a plan or strategy for achieving a  specific goal. (Heuer and Pherson, 2011)
	•	SWOT  is an acronym for Strenghts, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats. (Heuer and Pherson, 2011)
	•	In using this technique, the analyst first lists the strengths and weaknesses in the organization’s ability to achieve a goald, and then lists opportunities and threats in the external environement that would either help or hinder the organization from reachingthe goal. (Heuer and Pherson, 2011)
	•	SWOT is commonly used by all types of organizations to evaluate the Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats involved in any project or plan of action. (Heuer and Pherson, 2011)
	•	The strengths and weaknesses are internal to the organization, while the opportunities and threats are characteristics of the external environement. (Heuer and Pherson, 2011)
	•	After setting a goal or objective, use SWOT as a framework for collecting an organizing information in support of strategic planning and decision making  to achieve the goal or objective. Information is collected to analyse the plan’s strengths and weaknesses and the opportunities and threats present in the external environement that might have an impact on the ability to achieve the goal. (Heuer and Pherson, 2011)
	•	SWOT can generate useful information with relatively little effort, and it brings that information together in a framework that provides a good base for further analysis. It often points to specific actions that can or should be taken. (Heuer and Pherson, 2011)
	•	Because the techniques matches an organization’s or plan’s strengths and weaknesses against the opportunities and threats in the environment in which it operates, the plans or action recommendations that develop from the use of this technique are often quite practical. (Heuer and Pherson, 2011)
	•	This technique ahs been criticized for providing too easy a path to what is actually a more difficult planning decision. SWOT focuses on a single goal without weighing the costs and benefits of alternative means of achieving the same goal. (Heuer and Pherson, 2011)
	•	SWOT is a useful technique as long as the analyst recognizes that it does not necessarily tell the full story of what decision should or will be made. There may be other equally good or better courses of action. (Heuer and Pherson, 2011)
	•	As a first step in the development of a strategic planning system, business managers should therefore commence with the identification and evaluation of these strategic factors which assist or hinder the company in reaching its full potential. Because every company is confronted with a dynamic environment, the relative importance of a strategic factor will change constantly, so this analysis is accordingly to be of a permanent nature. (Houben et al., 1999)
	•	This list of strategic factors can be used as a point of departure for the actual strategic plan within a small or medium sized enterprise. It is a flexible instrument. The greatest advantage is that it helps managers of small and medium sized enterprises survey the different management areas, gain insight into the significance within the framework of the company, and accordingly initiate suitable actions. (Houben et al., 1999)
	•	To operate successfully in this respect, the company must concentrate its future objectives on its strengths, while averting tendencies related to the companies weaknesses. Responding to internal strengths and weaknesses is therefore an essential component of the strategic management process. (Houben et al., 1999)
	•	Strengths thereby relate to the competitive advantages and other distinguishing competencies which can be exploited by the company on the market. (Houben et al., 1999)
	•	The SWOT (strength, weakness, opportunity, and threat) analysis framework is quite commonly used to evaluate a company – where strengths and weaknesses are “internal” evaluations of the company’s competencies, whereas opportunities and threats are “external” evaluations about the industry or market within which the company does business. (Bose, 2008)
	•	The most popular analytical model is SWOT. If one is trying to determine the core competencies of an organization, then SWOT analysis is very appropriate. (Bose, 2008)
	•	SWOT analysis is useful when one needs to understand their competitive advantages in relation to the marketplace. (Bose, 2008)
	•	SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats). (Grunt, 2017)
	•	SWOT is actually an acronym that stands for strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. (Rizzo and Jounghyun Kim, 2005)
	•	The SWOT analysis is a commonly employed framework in the business world for analyzing the factors that influence a company's competitive position in the marketplace with an eye to the future. (Rizzo and Jounghyun Kim, 2005)
	•	the SWOT framework can also be usefully applied outside of the pure business domain.

(Rizzo and Jounghyun Kim, 2005)
	•	the SWOT framework can also be usefully applied outside of the pure business domain. (Rizzo and Jounghyun Kim, 2005)
	•	a SWOT analysis serves to uncover the optimal match between the internal strengths and weak-nesses of a given entity and the environmental trends(opportunities and threats) that the entity must face inthe marketplace. (Rizzo and Jounghyun Kim, 2005)
	•	a SWOT analysis serves to uncover the optimal match between the internal strengths and weaknesses of a given entity and the environmental trends (opportunities and threats) that the entity must face in the marketplace. A strength can be viewed as a resource, a uniqueapproach, or capacity that allows an entity toachieve its defined goals (e.g., VR can allow for precise control of stimulus delivery within a realistictraining or rehabilitation simulation). A weakness is a limitation, fault, or defect in theentity that impedes progress toward defined goals (e.g., the limited field of view and resolution in ahead-mounted display can limit usability and perceptual realism). An opportunitypertains to internal or externalforces in the entity’s operating environment, suchas a trend that increases demand for what the entity can provide or allows the entity to provide it more effectively (e.g., tremendous growth in the interac-tive digital gaming area has driven development of the high-quality, yet low-cost graphics cards needed to make VR deliverable on a basic PC). A threat can be any unfavorable situation in the entity’s environment that impedes its strategy by presening a barrier or constraint that limits achievement ofgoals (e.g., clinical administrators’ and financial officers’ belief that VR equipment is too expensive to incorporate into mainstream practice). (Rizzo and Jounghyun Kim, 2005)
	•	What has typically been found to be effective, based on SWOT input, is a strategy that takes advantage ofthe entity’s opportunitiesby employing itsstrengths and by proactively addressing threat sby correcting or compensating for weaknesses. (Rizzo and Jounghyun Kim, 2005)
	•	The principal ingredient of strategic planning is SWOT analysis—the assessment of organizational strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. (Kearns, 1992)
	•	SWOT can be either a powerful management tool or a superficial and even misleading exercise. (Kearns, 1992)
	•	The  SWOT  analysis  approach  (also  referred  to  as  the  “design  school  model”; Mintzberg  1994,  36-39)  seeks  to  address  the  question  of  strategy  formation  from  a two-fold  perspective:  from  an external appraisal  (of  threats  and  opportunities  in  an environment)  and  from  an internal appraisal  (of  strengths  and  weaknesses  in  an organisation).  (Karppi et al., 2001)
	•	The  internal  analysis  of  a  company’s  strengths  and  weaknesses  is  in turn intended to highlight certain strategies that the company can exploit, in particular, drawing  attention  to  certain  practices  that  the  company  may  need  to  correct. (Karppi et al., 2001)
	•	The actions to be undertaken that can be deduced from these four elements are: Build on strengths; Eliminate weaknesses; Exploit opportunities; Mitigate the effect of threats (Dealtry 1992: 2). (Karppi et al., 2001)
	•	Concentrating on whether or not planners, civil servants or academics can effectively model a SWOT analysis matrix, which will form the basis of  their  actual  development  strategies,  seems  to  neglect  the fact  that  all  of  the elements  of  such  an  analysis  are  necessarily  situational:  internal  capability  can  be assessed only with respect to an external context comprised of markets, political and social forces, competitors and their actions. (Karppi et al., 2001)
	•	SWOT analysis, which delves into a business' strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats, is used  widely  in  firms  and  classrooms  to  distill  fragmentary  facts  and  figures  into  concise depictions  of  the  strategic  landscape. (Valentin, 2011)
	•	SWOT  analysis  is  used  widely  in  firms  and  classrooms;  frequently  it  is  the  centerpiece  of  situation assessment  (Day  1984). (Valentin, 2011)
	•	Typical  SWOT  guidelines  promote  superficial  scanning  and  impromptu  categorizing  in lieu of methodical inquiry. (Valentin, 2011)
	•	The SWOT framework does not readily accommodate tradeoffs. (Valentin, 2011)
	•	SWOT guidelines commonly muddle accomplishments and strengths.
	•	SWOT  guidelines  generally  lack  criteria  for  prioritizing  SWOTs. (Valentin, 2011)
	•	he SWOT(Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportu-nities, Threats) framework isproposed by many as an analytical tool which should be used to categorize significant environmental factors both internal and external to the organization. (Pickton and Wright, 1998)
	•	SWOT analysis has been praised for its simplicity and practicality. As a framework it has been widely adopted but, generally, its use hasbeen accepted uncritically. It is timely to reappraise its value as a strategic management tool. (Pickton and Wright, 1998)
	•	the SWOT framework is a ‘naïve’ tool which may lead to strategic errors. (Pickton and Wright, 1998)
	•	SWOT should not be viewed as a static analytical tool with emphasis solely on its output. It should be used as a dynamic part of the management and business development process. (Pickton and Wright, 1998)
	•	Use of the SWOT framework tends to be most closely associated with the ’mechanistic' approach and suffers as a consequence of this association. SWOT analysis does not have to be mechanistic; adoption of the approach proposed here withem phasisonits process values as well as its output is strongly recommended. (Pickton and Wright, 1998)
	•	the world and textbooks propose the use of the SWOT framework (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats analysis) to practising managers and business and management students as a precursor to strategy formulation, managerial decision making and action. (Pickton and Wright, 1998)
	•	As a framework, SWOT analysis is highly commended for its simplicity and value in focusing attention on key issues which affect business development and growth. It there- fore has the potential to become a significant tool in identifying the factors which are most likely to influence frim’s strategy and success. Yet its very simplicity can be its downfall. (Pickton and Wright, 1998)
	•	Warning is given that a too simplistic adoption of the SWOT activity can lead to damaging consequences and suggestions are made as to how organizations can introduce this form of analysis to avoid its potential pitfalls through the use of Performance-Importance, Opportunity and Threat matrices. (Pickton and Wright, 1998)
	•	Highlighted are the extra benefits to be gained in the use of SWOT not just as a static analytical tool which helps generate an understanding of business activity but, also, as a dynamic part of the management process which can actually facilitate management development and which can be harnessed to the advantage of all involved. (Pickton and Wright, 1998)
	•	Stacey (1993) describes SWOT analysis as a list of an organization's strengths and weaknesses as indicated by an analysis of its resources and capabilities, plus a list of the threats and opportunities that an analysis of its environment identifies. Strategic logic obviously requires that the future pattern of actions to be taken should match strengths with opportunities, ward off threats, and seek to overcome weaknesses. (p. 52). (Pickton and Wright, 1998)
	•	SWOT analysis embraces both as it endeavours to make sense of the `raw' information generated from the environmental audit. (Pickton and Wright, 1998)
	•	SWOT analysis involves the collection and portrayal of information about internal and external factors which have, or may have, an impact on business. (Pickton and Wright, 1998)
	•	The SWOT is often portrayed as a 2x2 matrix and in this form is, indeed, no more than a listing or categorizing of ‘environmental' factors under the headings of Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats. Strengths and weaknesses pertain to factors internal to the company and opportunities and threats pertain to factors external to it. (Pickton and Wright, 1998)
	•	To its credit, SWOT analysis is supremely simple and, possibly, its greatest advantage is that its use allows management to focus its attention on the key issues which affect business development and growth. (Pickton and Wright, 1998)
	•	At this level it may be described as a naive form of analysis because it would typically consist of little more than a listing of factors which have been `intuitively' generated by one or more members of the company or an external agent of the company. The resultant chart should provide a reasonable overview of major issues which can be taken into account when subsequently drawing up strategic plans for the business but is often predicated upon the views of one manager (or a biased few) all of which contribute to the naivete of the analysis generated. More sophisticated analysis is often not conducted although the process of SWOT analysis certainly does not preclude the opportunity. (Pickton and Wright, 1998)
	•	At its most basic, carrying out a `SWOT' is a `low-grade' form of analysis which causes some people to question whether it is truly analysis at all. (Pickton and Wright, 1998)
	•	SWOT analysis which is conducted to produce a simple listing output is, frankly, inexcusably inadequate. (Pickton and Wright, 1998)
	•	In practical terms, a serious risk is taken if the SWOT is left at this naive level – it may be considered inherently dangerous because a false sense of confidence in its finndings may be created which in turn may lead to poor management decisions and action. (Pickton and Wright, 1998)
	•	While consultants and academics extol the virtues of SWOT analysis and recommend its use in the early stages of business planning (e.g. Piercy, 1991; McDonald, 1992; Field, 1992; Carson et al., 1995), descriptions of SWOT analysis typically do not address the problems and limitations which are often experienced in its use. (Pickton and Wright, 1998)
Regional SWOT analysis
	•	Regional SWOT analysis concentrates on the region in question, not on the organisation undertaking the SWOT, as was originally intended in the management sphere. (Karppi et al., 2001)
Decision prediction
	•	Caution is in order, however, whenever one thinks of predicting or even explaining antother person’s decision, regardless of whether the person is of simiar background or not. People do not always act rationally in their own best interests. Their decisions are influenced by emotions and habits, as well as by what others might think or values of which other may not be aware. The same is ture of organization or a government will act rationally, that is, in its own best interests. (Heuer and Pherson, 2011)
Deduction
	•	J'ai pensé qu'il me serait plus facile de descendre ensuite du tout à la partie, que de la partie au tout. C'est un axiome algébrique qui veut que l'on procède du connu à l'inconnu, et non de l'inconnu au connu... (Dumas, 1998)
Defeat
	•	Defeat may even come as a welcome release, as it probably did for many Germans in 1945. (Coker, 2009)
Defense
	•	defense implies resistance but does not guarantee security. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Defense, as the capacity to defeat the attack, is focused on reducing the likelihood of a successful attack, as is deterrence. Some defensive measures, like most forms of preparedness, are focused on reducing the negative returns of an attack. (Newsome, 2013)
National defense
	•	The national defence effort requires the internal integrity that allows it to work well enough as a system, indeed as a system of systems. (Gray, 2014)
Defense analysis
	•	Analysis may be pressed to suggest how much the attainable alternative postures should cost, and with what lead-times. (Gray, 2014)
	•	Defence analysis at all levels of military organization can and certainly will inform its chain of command of everything which it is capable about an enemy’s ability to fight, indeed as it will educate friendly commanders and their staffs about all aspects of friendly combat engagement and its logistical sustainment. (Gray, 2014)
	•	Defence analysis cannot usually be a source of timely and prudent advice on the ‘what’ of strategy. (Gray, 2014)
	•	The mathematics of honest defence analysis can yield important insight into the possible, if not probable, implications of the political and strategic prefer- ences that a polity debates when influenced by the ‘A’ list of potent factors. (Gray, 2014)
	•	What defence analysis can and should do is calculate that which is calcul- able and worth knowing. And what sensibly are calculable are most aspects of military force posture, including its prospective performance in combat, always granting obvious weaknesses that cannot be diminished significantly. (Gray, 2014)
Defense analyst
	•	Defence analysts are not competent professionally to choose the political purposes that should be translatable into the goals of strategy that may enable them. (Gray, 2014)
	•	Defence analysts can ‘read the runes’ on possible armed conflict by examining rigorously, indeed scientifically (if one can tolerate dependence upon discre- tionary, though not altogether arbitrary, assumptions) how friendly forces of particular kinds currently are believed likely to fare. (Gray, 2014)
Defense budget
	•	undefined and ambiguous threats make defending budgets difficult. (Mauk, 2010)
	•	one cannot possibly identify the right defence budget, if for no better reason than that such knowledge is unknowable. (Gray, 2014)
	•	Defence planning and budgeting entails guesswork about a future that we ourselves, by our choices, may well influence in unpredictable, or at least unanticipated, ways. (Gray, 2014)
	•	Defence is allowed what is left in the public purse. (Gray, 2014)
Defense planning
	•	defence and strategic planning begins and ends with the management of strategic risk. (Thomson, 2012)
	•	Defense planning is largely about developing capabilities and options for the mid and long term. (Davis, 2000)
	•	A fundamental element of such planning is accounting for uncertainty. (Davis, 2000)
	•	The concept is that one begins (top left) by assessing the threat and characterizing the related requirements for defense. Then one develops options for dealing with the threats, evaluates the options to find the “optimum” strategy, and proceeds to implement that strategy. (Davis, 2000)
	•	It is comparable to the engineering problem of being given “requirements” for some system and then developing a system to meet those requirements. (Davis, 2000)
	•	the value of detailed planning: in fact, the likelihood of detailed plans proving valid over the long run is low. Nor can we rely upon environment-shaping efforts to be successful: too much about the international security system is chaotic. (Davis, 2000)
	•	what matters is adaptiveness and this applies very much to defense planning (Davis, Gompert, and Kugler, 1996). (Davis, 2000) 
	•	The basic concept here is that a nation should want its military forces to be operationally adaptive so that, at any given time, it can deal with a wide range of contingencies and situational details. (Davis, 2000)
	•	If a nation takes seriously planning for adaptiveness—rather than for some particular notions about specific environments, threats, and situations—then the effect is profound. The very nature of planning changes from a tedious process of extrapolation and justification of the status quo to a more creative assessment of potential needs, an uncertainty-sensitive assessment of the relative merits of program alternatives, and a change in language. (Davis, 2000)
	•	Acquisition of systems also changes. Instead of attempting al- ways to maximize the buy of some system to bring down its unit cost, or of buying systems or forces that would marginally improve a na- tion’s current defense capabilities against current enemies with cur- rent doctrine, it may be willing to pay a premium for the benefits of small-scale experiments with advanced systems and doctrine, exper- iments that would assure the ability to procure or buy the needed systems and use them effectively if needed. (Davis, 2000)
	•	Current scal and operational realities no doubt constrain the defense decision space. It is realistic to view the coming era as one of general defense and national security evolution. (Freier, 2009)
	•	Recognition that prevention and response are zero sum propositions. In a policy environment marked by declining defense resources, the balance between investment in prevention and investment in effective crisis response is particularly delicate. (Freier, 2009)
	•	Decreasing resources and increasing challenges require rigorous net assessment; the careful allocation, balance, and mitigation of risk; and unprecedented coordination between various government agencies. (Freier, 2009)
	•	Near-term defense realities and a future de ned by persistent unconventional con ict complicate defense decisionmaking in ways not seen since the Vietnam War. (Freier, 2009)
	•	prudent strategic investments across instruments of power and the nimble practice of traditional statecraft offer greater opportunities for driving traditional military hazards further toward the unlikely. (Freier, 2009)
	•	Planning for defense-relevant shocks involves marrying plausibility and extreme hazard with defense relevance. (Freier, 2009)
	•	Defence planning needs context, because it cannot navigate itself. (Gray, 2014)
	•	In a sense defence planning is a grim, even possibly hopeless, struggle against the laws of physics, because the future never comes and cannot be known with certainty. (Gray, 2014)
	•	The temporal context is a theme that has to be central to a study of defence planning. (Gray, 2014)
	•	Strategy and defence planning communities think about and plan for their future security. (Gray, 2014)
	•	In its higher realm of concern, defence planning substantially is guesswork, and it has to be such—educated guesswork one hopes, but still guesswork. (Gray, 2014)
	•	Defence planning and budgeting entails guesswork about a future that we ourselves, by our choices, may well influence in unpredictable, or at least unanticipated, ways. (Gray, 2014)
	•	Defence planning has to be done, notably by guesswork, because there is no reliable expert methodology available we can employ. Much about defence can and needs to be analysed with quantitative methods. (Gray, 2014)
	•	Defence planning is usefully strongly indicative of a military focus, with- out being formally exclusive of non-military thought and activities. It would not be wholly unjust to regard defence planning as a concept that is a healthy compromise between the commonplace understandings of strategic and military planning. (Gray, 2014)
	•	By defence planning I mean preparations for the defence of a polity in the future (near-, medium- and far-term). (Gray, 2014)
	•	the following activities which need to be considered as continuous processes in governance: Preparation of military advice relevant to the feasibility of options for political choice as policy; selection and design of grand and military strategies; the design, making, and administration of military programmes; the preparation of military plans; coordination with complementary social, economic, and political/diplo- matic programmes and activities; the gathering and assessment of intelligence bearingon possible risk sand threats to the polity; cooperation with allies (and co-belligerents, if not necessarily friends). (Gray, 2014)
	•	Official wording varies over time and certainly across frontiers. (Gray, 2014)
	•	The subject here has a firm centre of concern in the enduring need for political communities to plan, meaning to make systematic provision, for possible or probable menaces to their security that include the threat or use of military force. All polities are obliged to attempt to plan for their security in a future that will or strongly might contain peril in some military form. (Gray, 2014)
	•	Ironically, among the virtues of the term defence planning for my purpose is the fact that it does not literally require any performance covered in its name to be strategic. (Gray, 2014)
	•	The beginning of wisdom about defence planning is recognition of a necessity to discard the Western logical preference for sharp clarity of analytical distinctions (either/or reasoning). (Gray, 2014)
	•	The details of choices in defence planning are always changing of course, because the contexts for choice are more or less dynamic. But, most significantly, that which is attempted in defence planning is functionally eternal; it is trans-historical. (Gray, 2014)
	•	Strategy and Defence Planning is policy relevant, but not policy-oriented. (Gray, 2014)
	•	Strategy, defence planning, and uncertainty are interdependent in the vital sense that one cannot understand any of them without simultaneously grappling with the meaning and implications of the others. That granted, the subject primarily is defence planning broadly understood literally as a function essential of performance for any and every polity. (Gray, 2014)
	•	For a Taoist rather than an Aristotelian thought it is not useful to try to think hierarchically about strategy and defence planning because their separate identities should not be obviously distinguishable; each should serve and hugely influence the other. (Gray, 2014)
	•	Defence planning is an eternal and ubiquitous necessity for all human societies; their particular political arrangements determine who does it, how, and exactly why. (Gray, 2014)
	•	Strategy in its general theory identifies inclusively the pieces and workings that comprise the logical architecture for defence planning. (Gray, 2014)
	•	Politics (and its then contemporary processes) yields the legitimate authority that provides decision over the substantive issues that must be addressed in defence planning. (Gray, 2014)
	•	defence planning decisions that by their nature must lean beyond our cartography into the foreign land of the future. (Gray, 2014)
	•	defence planning can be approached and understood most usefully in the light that is shed by three principal concepts employed to function in cooperation: these are strategy, politics, history, with each functioning as context for the others. (Gray, 2014)
	•	defence planning is the compounded product of all three great interdependent variables. (Gray, 2014)
	•	Defence planning only makes sense when it is regarded contextually, and the most important contexts are those that lend themselves to decidedly porous categorization as strategic, political, and historical. (Gray, 2014)
	•	Pole position is merited by strategy because of the inclusivity of its logical structure and the high forensic value for analysis of that structure. Order and meaning is given to the mission of defence planning and its ever changing menu of possible specific tasks, by the theory of strategy. That theory is unique in its ability to explain what is done, why it is done, and why it can be done well or poorly. (Gray, 2014)
	•	Defence planning is indeed highly, necessarily, and permanently political, in that the choices made reflect the relative influence of contributors to the process of governance. (Gray, 2014)
	•	defence planning for future security is and has to be thoroughly political. (Gray, 2014)
	•	Defence planning should be conducted on and across the ‘strategy bridge’.7 With its insistence upon a good enough fit among politically derived (and often changeable) ends, the ways selected to achieve the ends, and the military and other means to be employed, the whole house of strategy is constructed in such a way that the necessary discipline of politics itself is disciplined by the constraints of practice. (Gray, 2014)
	•	There are many constraints on the endeavours of strategists to perform well enough in defence planning, not all of which are political by reasonable definition. The hopes and anxieties that help fuel the political process within which defence planning is done, do not command entirely the subject matter of relevance to defence. (Gray, 2014)
	•	The politics of defence planning and the practice of strategy not infrequently are influ- enced decisively by feelings, even impulses, which may well be unreasonable but will be rational given people’s attempts to match their wishes with ways and means of action. (Gray, 2014)
	•	Historical experience, both personal—in minor key—and as translated and transmitted by historians—in major key—is the only repository of data relevant to efforts in defence planning for future security. (Gray, 2014)
	•	strategy can and should provide the conceptual framework within which defence planning is debated, conducted, and expressed in executive action. (Gray, 2014)
	•	Defence planning should be a rational project, meaning that it plans to acquire and sustain (military) means for the contingent purpose of employing them in ways that advance the political ends chosen as policy. (Gray, 2014)
	•	Because of the complexity of the strategic realm it is not possible to define rational defence planning only as the planning that future events and non-events (thinking of nuclear deterrence to date) seems to show to have been successful. It is possible to make the wrong choices quite rationally. (Gray, 2014)
	•	It is the strategy bridge between the interdependent realms of politics and military (inter alia) instrument that is most critical to prudence in defence planning. (Gray, 2014)
	•	The permanent fact that there can be no empirical verification of assump- tions about the future means that there is a fundamental source of indiscipline caused by the unavailability of evidence, to which defence planning in all polities is ever liable. (Gray, 2014)
	•	Defence planning cannot be self-referential. (Gray, 2014)
	•	It is important to understand that there is and can be nothing in a national defence planning process inherently able to ensure prudent calibration of the product of that process for coping with security peril. There is no political wisdom for policy in the defence planning process unless a strategy bridge requires, encourages, and enables its timely provision. (Gray, 2014)
	•	The principal reason why strategy should be regarded as the most important of concepts for understanding and explain- ing defence planning, is because it alone can provide the necessary inclusivity of diverse relevant subjects. (Gray, 2014)
	•	A robust theory of defence planning capable of serving the serious practical demands of government has to recognize those realities of political life that harass and may frustrate orderly method. (Gray, 2014)
	•	defence planning has to be organized and conducted in the fullest possible appreciation of the limitations under which it has no option other than to function. (Gray, 2014)
	•	We want to believe that defence planning is conducted for a substantially rational and reasonable world political and strategic context. But, if we accept the awesome diversity in the historical reality of politics and strategy, then we need to conduct ourselves in a manner that is uncomfortably, if reluctantly, tolerant of uncertainties great and small. (Gray, 2014)
	•	Defence planning is a true ‘wicked’ problem set; one for which even the superior looking options may well prove grossly inadequate. (Gray, 2014)
	•	The theory of defence planning for national security requires contextualization with reference to risks, threats, and dangers that may need to be countered. (Gray, 2014)
	•	A polity conducts defence planning only because it is assumed, really unarguably, that the world of the future either will be or could be a dangerous place. (Gray, 2014)
	•	Defence planning is a permanent and therefore always an incomplete project. (Gray, 2014)
	•	Adroit management of the process of defence planning cannot avoid the authority of the super- ordinate fact that policy ends ultimately have meaning not so much for the orderly guidance of the domestic realities of national defence, but rather for the influencing of the polity’s largely foreign security context. The ends of security policy are not ‘given’ in much detail, in good part because security dangers, both the mature and the possible, inherently are dynamic. (Gray, 2014)
	•	The defence planning challenge of seeking to plan against unwanted contingency in some time(s) in the future, cannot be met in the main by providing adequately so as to cope well enough only with a principal menace. (Gray, 2014)
	•	The future may be unknowable, but politicians need to believe, or at least appear to believe, that the commu- nity is capable of improving its future security by wise grand-strategic choices bearing directly and indirectly on national security in the future. (Gray, 2014)
	•	Defence planning strives to achieve some understanding of future political and strategic context, because that context produces the contingencies with which defence planning must attempt to cope. (Gray, 2014)
	•	Defence planning conducted in ignorance and therefore necessarily significantly by guesswork, is simply the way things are and must remain. (Gray, 2014)
	•	The theory and practice of strategy encompass the whole subject of defence planning. Strategic ways chosen to employ tactical means for policy ends selected by a permanently political process is the all but pulsating dynamic reality of the subject here. Just as politics and its policy never really sleep, neither does the practice of strategy about and in defence planning. (Gray, 2014)
	•	The defence planning challenge is essentially to seek to understand how best we can cope with the need for prudent thought and behaviour regarding a permanently future condition for which currently ‘known knowns’ are both in desperately short supply, and even when supplied should not be fully trusted. (Gray, 2014)
	•	Different countries, at different times, have employed different words, but my preference should be clear enough, as is its intentional inclusivity. Defence rather than security is specified in order to indicate that military concerns are my primary focus. (Gray, 2014)
	•	Strategic theory has unique utility in its provision of the only model that enables understanding as fuel for practical behaviour in defence planning adequate to meet the challenge of uncertainty. (Gray, 2014)
	•	Defence planning is not a technical enterprise conducted by expert defence analysts with some inputs from the military agents who actually have to do it—whatever, wherever, and however the ‘it’ happens to be. Such inputs from expert analysis and military experience can be vitally important, but policy, meaning politics, is or should be sovereign. (Gray, 2014)
	•	Defence planning for the protec- tion of the polity does not confine political authority to a consultative prerogative, with a duty to warn or encourage. (Gray, 2014)
	•	Defence planning in hope of peace, though necessarily in readiness for war, must be governed by the same logic and political authority as war itself. (Gray, 2014)
	•	What needs to be appreciated more fully is the quality of the relationship between defence planning and policy, with particular reference to the salience of domestic political context. (Gray, 2014)
	•	Given that defence planning is about politics, foreign and domestic, it is scarcely surprising, in a democracy at least, that government licenses and conducts such planning in ways responsive, at the least attentive, to the public mood regarding danger. (Gray, 2014)
	•	It is an understandable error, but error nonetheless, in effect to approach matters of defence planning in a narrowly self-referential manner. (Gray, 2014)
	•	Defence planning for the national security needs careful performance. (Gray, 2014)
	•	when the defence planning challenge is hampered by great uncertainty, because it is geared to be able to meet variables with values not exactly known, then the possibility can be acute of severe cracks appearing between extant policy and military capability. (Gray, 2014)
	•	Defence planning always is the dynamic product of a no less dynamic domestic policy process that is quintessentially political. (Gray, 2014)
	•	The political process that governs national defence planning may be dominated by people and institutions less than deeply concerned about the military dimension to national security. (Gray, 2014)
	•	Budgetary allocation to defence planning for the security function can be decided somewhat arbitrarily by the ‘remainder’ method. This translates as meaning that the financing of the military aspects of national security is determined arbitrarily by the remainder of public money after other, higher, priorities are deemed satisfied. (Gray, 2014) 
	•	Fear in its several forms (concern, anxiety, alarm) is a variable condition ever liable to haunt defence planning. (Gray, 2014)
	•	Defence planning by definition is conducted with a view to helping shape a polity’s security context in the future. (Gray, 2014)
	•	Defence planning for any polity therefore is about the achievement of a satisfactory power relationship with those who may be motivated to attempt to change the terms of competition in their favour to its disadvantage. Defence planning cannot help but be about politics. (Gray, 2014)
	•	planning in preparation for defence in the future is not a subject and agenda that can prudently be left to those who are strategically illiterate. (Gray, 2014)
	•	Defence planning in this wider sense has to engage with the whole field encompassed by the perilously inclusive concept of grand strategy. (Gray, 2014)
	•	defence planning is not primarily a mili- tary subject, rather is it political. (Gray, 2014)
	•	It is useful to organize the argument about civil-military relations into four rather porous categories of issues, pertaining to: responsibility; military-political currencyconversion; prudent statecraft; money and other domestic opportunity costs. (Gray, 2014)
	•	Defence planning must have future military security as a principal concern, but national security cannot prudently be reduced to an issue-area all but entirely military-strategic in content and reference. (Gray, 2014)
	•	The lingua franca of defence planning has to be money, not strategy. (Gray, 2014)
	•	defence planning, even when conducted with the serious aid of a civil-military strategy bridge, is argued and debated in budgetary terms as money. (Gray, 2014)
	•	The challenge posed by the necessity to conduct defence planning under conditions of great uncertainty can best be met by people and organizations educated in general strategic theory, in history, and in methods of defence analysis. (Gray, 2014)
	•	defence planning always may be about the fitness or otherwise of friendly military forces to defend the polity. (Gray, 2014)
	•	Defence planning must have a substantial basis in defence analysis, but that analysis cannot have stand-alone integrity—in effect in splendid isolation from its domestic political context, climate, and therefore mood. (Gray, 2014)
	•	A non-trivial challenge to prudence in defence planning is the need to grasp the reality of the political and moral legitimacy of sharply different points of view. (Gray, 2014)
	•	defence planning by and large is dominated by the possibility of contingencies that have to be approached largely as challenges to our ability to anticipate political behaviour by individuals and even groups who may or may not be open to rational, let alone responsible, strategic argument. (Gray, 2014)
	•	defence planning is understood to refer most significantly to preparation for the defence of a country in the future, in its highest reaches one must grant in practice discretionary authority to the collective political, moral and, in a somewhat subordinate role, strategic, will of a polity. (Gray, 2014)
	•	All security communities are obliged to satisfy the function of defence planning. (Gray, 2014)
	•	Defence planning is an exercise in strategy, and strategy is about politics, not science. (Gray, 2014)
	•	A golden rule for defence planning has been, and continues to be, the absolute necessity of defeating or at least evading an existential and plausibly super threat. (Gray, 2014)
	•	the content of defence planning is the consequence of political choice, not strict necessity. (Gray, 2014)
	•	Error is professionally inescapable for the defence planner. The fundamental reason why this has to be so is because war and its warfare is not a science. Future war, the focus of defence planning, cannot be studied and analysed sensibly for the purpose of eliciting reliably correct answers from the data. (Gray, 2014)
	•	Defence planning has to provide prudently for a future strategic history that in important respects cannot be anticipated with confidence in plans. (Gray, 2014)
	•	Given that perfect knowledge of future policy demands upon defence planning is always unobtainable, plainly an approach to the subject is required which somehow can offset unhelpful laws of nature, while succeeding well enough in performance in aid of the vital mission. (Gray, 2014)
	•	A prime virtue for competent defence planning has to be adaptability to unexpected events and anxieties. (Gray, 2014)
	•	defence planning cannot be adaptable as a boundary-free value, because it comes at a cost and resources always are bounded. (Gray, 2014)
	•	The Holy Grail of defence planning has to be the key that opens the door to understanding what is likely to prove to be good enough. (Gray, 2014)
	•	Defence planning is closer to a leap into the unknown and unknowable than it is to an orderly realm permissive of rational decision making reliant upon scientific method to generate correct answers in which one can repose high confidence. (Gray, 2014)
	•	Defence planning is governed by politics. (Gray, 2014)
	•	The process of defence planning is inalienably political, while its strong dependence upon detailed analysis encourages a search for calculable demon- strability of correctness, given the more or less mandatory political and strategic parameters of the time, place, and circumstance. (Gray, 2014)
	•	The defence planning function: Has been a permanent feature in history, regardless of time, politics, place and culture. Always could be analysed within the conceptual framework of the general theory of strategy: whether or not contemporaries articulated explicitly any version of that theory. The logically interdependent ideas of ends, ways, and means, can be employed to make strategic sense of historical practice, without anachronism that would be harmful to understanding. All human communities have thought and behaved politically; politics are not cultural, they are socially human; indeed they may simply be ubiquitous in animal behaviour. Human thought and behaviour has changed greatly in historical times, but not (yet) in ways that imperil the importance of the strategic narrative in our general history. (Gray, 2014)
	•	Because strategic history is the only resource available to defence planning as a repository of relevant experience, the abuse of analogy is all too common an anachronistic blight in public defence debate. (Gray, 2014)
	•	Although defence planning in a vital sense must be about the future, in practice it cannot help but be dominated by people whose whole knowledge and experience is only of the past. (Gray, 2014)
	•	Because defence planning in most aspects is characterized by metric applications, it is not hard to be persuaded that the numbers that often function in effect as the lingua franca of national security have an authority largely on their own terms. (Gray, 2014)
	•	An important difficulty with and for defence planning is the necessity for a polity’s defence effort to have both internal and external integrity. (Gray, 2014)
	•	the entire military machine depends upon strategic guidance in defence planning that has a reasonably settled view as to the probable, certainly the desirable, character of future military operations. (Gray, 2014)
	•	Defence planning, though only generally, can be said to face abroad, but having said that one must not fail to acknowledge the facts that it must both function effectively internally as a system and be politically tolerable at home. Everything connects to everything else. 1. Politics behind governance must license defence effort in general, and endorse or condone particular defence choices. 2. Strategy should guide defence planning and military execution in attempted realization of future political objectives. 3. Defence planning must translate strategic guidance into a capable range of feasible ways to be employed by achievable military means in the service of politics and its policy. (Gray, 2014)
	•	Defence planning framework must be based on judgements about future threats and political values and priorities that may be more or less convincing and useful, but are not questions to which there are ‘righ’ or ‘wrong’ answers. (Frühling, 2014)
	•	[…] defence planning as a task may be simple, but it is never easy. (Frühling, 2014)
	•	defence planning is always about the management of strategic risk, although the types and characteristics of risks to be managed change over time. (Frühling, 2014)
	•	The benefits of structure, coherence, consistency and transparency in framing defence planning can go beyond the efficient use of defence resources, and the quality of defence decision making as public policy. (Frühling, 2014)
	•	Defence planning primarily responds to the material logic of the defence effort, especially the efficiency and effectiveness in the use of limited resources in pursuit of the objectives set by political leaders. The ability of military forces to operate, for example, rests on many factors other than the type and quantity of mahor equipment in the force structure itself: units are held at different levels of readiness; stock of expendables, maintenance and repair capacity determine their sustainability over time; the rate of modernization of existing equipment can be varied; and intabgible factors such as doctrine, training, morale and leadership are often just as important for overall capability. (Frühling, 2014)
	•	Trade-offs between the different elements of capability are inevitable, because all of them require financial and other limited resources. Military expertise and professional judgement are essential to determine the feasibility of, and the requirements for, successful military operations. (Frühling, 2014)
	•	Defence planning is at its core a process of managing strategic risk. (Frühling, 2014)
	•	Based on the details of both sides’ force structures, capabilities, doctrine and the terrain, it is possible to define possible outcomes with a relatively high certainty of assessment through net assessment. Assessing details that the adversary also has to take into account, such as leadership intentions, culture, society and one’s own capabilities, it is possible to determine at least orders of probabilities with relatively high certainty of assessment. (Frühling, 2014)
	•	Planning and strategy are closely related and subordinate to ‘policy’, but they arefundamentally different concepts. (Frühling, 2014)
	•	defence planning cannot develop strategy, which is a task of the political and strategic leadership. Rather, strategy and the pattern of strategic risk to be reduced form the strategic guidance that defence planning has to translate into actual programmes, forces and activities. (Frühling, 2014)
	•	Uncertainty is pervasive in defence planning, but it can be of very different kinds, and impact on the task of the defence decision-maker in different ways. (Frühling, 2014)
	•	For defence planning to be a coherent approach to the management of strategic risk, there must be a conceptual – or ‘configurational’ – fit to the different elements that make up a defence planning framework. The way in which requirements are derived must be consistent withrisk pattern and strategy. This includes the inferential approach – deductively inferred from known information that is directly relevant for describing a specific threat, or abductively derived from whatever information is available, especially about one’s own situation – and the extent to which warning and increases in readiness are relied upon to discount future risks and requirements. (Frühling, 2014)
	•	Different situations of strategic risk will require different ways of going about defence planning. Two criteria are particularly important in this regard: the overall confidence with which strategic risks are assessed, and the number of risks that must be managed at the same time. (Frühling, 2014)
	•	importance of uncertainty for defence planning, and its close relationship with the concept of strategic risk. (Frühling, 2014)
	•	In defense planning, elaborating and diversifying analytic resources for strategic estimates also did not clearly reduce the potential for er- roneous decisions. Determining the salience and proper weight of con- flicting indicators of military power and objectives or of the compara- tive significance of quantitative and qualitative factors in politically charged assessments of the U.S.-Soviet military balance was inextricable from the fundamental debate over foreign policy. (Betts, 2007)

Persistent management principle
	•	persistent management principle serves as one measure of merit for evaluating future structure, acquisition, and strategy decisions inside DoD. (Freier, 2009)
	•	The permanence of defence planning as a behaviour of government may or may not be regarded as insufficiently substantiated by historical evidence, but assuredly its prospective future is not an unstated assumption critical to this enquiry. (Gray, 2014)

Defense planner
	•	The educated strategist and defence planner, and hopefully his or her political leaders also, have to provide necessary security for the short-term, while not doing so in a manner likely to promote insecurity in the medium- and long-terms. (Gray, 2014)
	•	The strategic geography of war has a vital impact on the sense or otherwise in defence planners’ choices. (Gray, 2014)
	•	Given that defence planners cannot know that which is not knowable in advance about the future, it is all too plain to see that a leading challenge they must endeavour to meet well enough is coping with the consequences of (largely) pre-war planning errors. (Gray, 2014)
	•	History is the (only) archive of human experience that must serve as the database from which theory as explanation can or may be derived for the education of contemporary defence planners. (Gray, 2014)
	•	People cannot simply be trained to function competently as defence planners. The most important questions that defence planning requires to be answered can only be met by minds educated to exercise sound judgement in the face of challenges that are unique in exact character, even though they are persisting in nature. (Gray, 2014)
	•	The beginning of wisdom has to be recognition of the major constraints under which all defence planners must suffer everywhere and at all time: the impossibility of knowing reliably what is unknowable about the context for security in the future; the impossibility of acquiring and recognizing certain knowledge pertaining to adversary choices (even if his situation should be predictable, which it will not be); the certainty of error in some of our choices over policy, strategy, and (individual and collective) tactics; the certainty of surprise in the future, including a few wholly unanticipated contingencies;15 the certainty of surprise over some of the consequences of developments that are not in themselves entirely unanticipated. (Gray, 2014)
	•	Policy ends are not eternal. Defence planners have to design strategy (as strategies) that both supports a national policy that is liable to shift, and is able to cope well enough with foreign opposition. (Gray, 2014)
	•	Critical review of defence planning in historical practice reveals unsurprisingly that high competence by planners has been the exception rather than the rule. (Gray, 2014)
	•	The general theory of strategy tells defence planners that theirs is the task of effecting and sustaining a hugely troubled, perhaps unstable, marriage among three parties or categories with clearly distinctive natures. (Gray, 2014)
	•	The task of the defence planner is so to prepare his polity prudentially that it is able to cope well enough with dangerous developments or happenings in the future— contingencies. (Gray, 2014)
	•	Defence planning cannot aspire to deliver an objective national security as a reward for its prudent calculation by net assessment of threat management. It would be unwise for a social scientist to claim that particular highly undesirable contingencies would be impossible. (Gray, 2014)
	•	defence planning understood inclusively is the field of grand strategy, not only military strategy. (Gray, 2014)
	•	the defence planner cannot assume that it is possible to make robust provisions even for a range of perils envisaged with a liberal tolerance of possibilities well beyond the pale of contemporary expert en- dorsement as high probabilities. (Gray, 2014)
	•	the defence planner is required in effect to perform contingency planning for unknown and unknowable contingencies. (Gray, 2014)
	•	The defence planner today will derive much no doubt useful information about potential enemy capabilities, including doctrines and even cultural tendencies, as well as his technical preferences and probable competencies. (Gray, 2014)
	•	The defence planner of today cannot look to the past for reliable guidance as to how to think and act in regard to the challenges of tomorrow. (Gray, 2014)
	•	Defence planning conducted with little or no reference to politics must lack both purpose and legitimacy, while when conducted with no substantial regard for strategy it can make no sense. Politics are necessary for defence planning but they cannot be sufficient. (Gray, 2014)
	•	The task of defence planners is thus most straightforward if the identity of enemies is clear, and the threat is well understood in terms of all the dimensions that can be known in advance – including society, culture, politics, ethics, economics and logistics, organization, military administration, the quality of intelligence, strategic theoryand doctrine, technology and geography. (Frühling, 2014)
Defense policy
	•	Asking how defence policy is made is easy, but answering the question is far from simple. (Dillon, 1988)
	•	Defense policy is made at the interface of domestic and international politics, and at the interface of peace and war. Its location there has basic theoretical and practical implications. Theoretically, defence policy making is both constructive and mediatory. Operating at the boundaries of the state, defence policy plays an influential role in constructing and reconstructing the political community by mediating its internal as well as its external relations through the threat and use of force.  The bulk of the defence effort of the countries examined here is externally oriented, and their armed forces are largely concerned with the outise world. (Dillon, 1988)
	•	The relationship between internal and external security, however, represents a continuum rather than a disjuncture, and defense policy becomes more internally oriented the more the domestic composition of the political community is challenged through internal dissent, subversion or armed insurrection. (Dillon, 1988)
	•	Practically speaking, defence policy making is also subject to both domestic and international influences in a world where domestic politics are deeply penetrated, in any event, by the dynamics of international economic and political forces. (Dillon, 1988)
	•	If managing defence policy confronts the decision maker with a complicated politico-military task, it also demands from students of defence decision making a knowledge of domestic politics as well as an understanding of international affairs. (Dillon, 1988) 
	•	What needs to be appreciated more fully is the quality of the relationship between defence planning and policy, with particular reference to the salience of domestic political context. (Gray, 2014)
	•	Prudent policymakers know they must be careful to attempt to control and limit the possible negative consequences of defence planning effort. (Gray, 2014)
	•	Maintaining a defence force is a form of public policy, in which governments spend significant resources to provide the public good of security. (Frühling, 2014)
	•	Following Clausewitz, the ends which military forces serve are often defined as ‘policy’, and include the interests and objectives that governmetns identify for the nation’s armed forces to defend or achieve. (Frühling, 2014)
	•	The coherence of defence policy ultimately rests on the political logic of the use of force, which alone gives meaning to the myriad practical decisions that are involved in the maintenance and use of armed forces. (Frühling, 2014)
	•	Planning and strategy are closely related and subordinate to ‘policy’, but they arefundamentally different concepts. (Frühling, 2014)
	•	

Defence policy making
	•	Defence policy making is also dominated by the operations of state organizations like Ministries or Departments of Defence. If we follow Max Weber’s definition of the state, as that organization which claims a monopoly over the legitimate use of force in a given territory, we can also add that state structures are largely responsible for defining the threat to a territory, its peoples and its institutions including, of course, the state itself. (Dillon, 1988)
	•	If managing defence policy confronts the decision maker with a complicated politico-military task, it also demands from students of defence decision making a knowledge of domestic politics as well as an understanding of international affairs. (Dillon, 1988) 
	•	no defence policy community operate in a vacuum; each is located in its own particular historical time and national political space. (Dillon, 1988)
	•	Defence decision making does not operate like a voiceless mechanism and neither does international conflict. Quite the contrary, national decision making and international relations are both filled with the noise of competing voices: individuals, groups, state organizations and global ideologies. Each defence policy community, therefore, has its own voice which speaks through an inherited vocabulary. By this means, it provides a particular rendition of the national values it seeks to defend, in addition to an interpretation of the international threats against which thses values require defence. Thus as they translate the goals of national politics and the perceived demands of the strategic environment into national defence policy, so defence decision majers contirut e to the formation of the state and of the inter-state system. (Dillon, 1988)
	•	as these decision makers deal with all the changing issues on their policy agenda, so they adapt their vocabulary of policy making. (Dillon, 1988)
	•	As Maurice Paerton has argued, industrialization shaped the nature of war as much as it influenced the character of peace. More to the point, it transformed the nature of the relationship between the two; and that is precisely where defence policy making takes place. (Dillon, 1988)
	•	In the intellectually grubbier world of defence decision making, the answers are always provided through a combination of power and persuasion, and they are always partial answers dependent upon circunstances and change. (Dillon, 1988)
	•	Comparability and individuality run together throughout defence decision making. (Dillon, 1988)
Defense policy makers
	•	Defense policy-makers often profess to confront unprecedented uncertainty and complexity when making decisions with long-term implications. (Frühling, 2014)
	•	Optimal decisions in defense policy therefore depend on the use of strategic in- telligence: the acquisition, analysis, and appreciation of relevant data. (Betts, 2007)
Defense policy planning
	•	Defence policy planning, therefore, reflects the developments taking place in industrial societies generally. (Dillon, 1988)
	•	Just as corporate industrial planning in effect seeks to colonize the future, so defence planning also seeks to anticipate and shape the strategic environment. Knowledge, therefore, has also become a product of organization (from corporations to research establishments and universities). (Dillon, 1988)
	•	defence preparations require specific decisions, such as the number and specifications of new platforms and weapons systems that are to be acquired, states of unit readiness and peacetime stocks of spares and consumables, and the content of training manuals and doctrine. (Frühling, 2014)

Defense policy communities
	•	[…] defence policy communities have to decide how much to spend on defence and how best to spend it. (Dillon, 1988)
Defense policy objectives
	•	defense policy objectives is crucial for governmental and departmental accountability, for public debate and, ultimately, the national security of a country. (Frühling, 2014)
Defense strategy
	•	The defense strategy serves the broad national objectives of peace, freedom, and prosperity. (Department of Defense, 2001)
	•	U.S. defense strategy seeks to defend freedom for the United States and its allies and friends, and it helps to secure an international environment of peace that makes other goals possible. (Department of Defense, 2001)
	•	In relation to the defence effort in general, however, strategy must be conceived of in a broader sense. Everett Carl Dolman referred to it as: a plan for attaining continuing advantage. For the goal of strategy is not to culminate events, to establishfinality in the discourse between states, but to influence states’ discourse in such a way that it will go forward on favorable terms. (Frühling, 2014)
	•	A defence strategy should thus provide an explanation of how the maintenance and, if necessary, the use of armed force will reduce strategic risks overall. (Frühling, 2014)
	•	the objective of a broader defence strategy is the security of the nation from any combination of risks that might threaten it. (Frühling, 2014)
	•	Strategy must guide the defence effort in the maintenance and use of force, and direct the way it is to contribute to the management of strategic risks. (Frühling, 2014)

Defensiveness
	•	Life is harsh and people competitive. We naturally must look after our own interests. We also want to feel that we are independent, doing our own bidding. That is why when others try to persuade or change us, we become defensive and resistant. To give in challenges our need to feel autonomous. That is why to get people to move from their defensive positions you must always make it seem like what they are doing is of their own free will. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Creating a feeling of mutual warmth helps soften people’s resistance and makes them want to help. Never attack people for their beliefs or make them feel insecure about their intelligence or goodness—that will only strengthen their defensiveness and make your task impossible. Make them feel that by doing what you want they are being noble and altruistic—the ultimate lure. Learn to tame your own stubborn nature and free your mind from its defensive and closed positions, unleashing your creative powers. (Greene, 2018)
	•	From early on in life we humans develop a defensive and self- protective side to our personality. It begins in early childhood as we cultivate a sense of personal physical space that others should not violate. It later expands into a feeling of personal dignity—people should not coerce or manipulate us into doing things we don’t want to. We should be free to choose what we desire. (Greene, 2018)
	•	As we get older, however, these defensive qualities often solidify into something much more rigid, and for good reason. People are continually judging and appraising us—are we competent enough, good enough, a team player? We never feel quite free of this scrutiny. One noticeable failure in our lives, and people’s scrutiny will turn into negative judgments that can cripple us for a long time. Furthermore, we have the feeling that people are always trying to take from us—they want our time, our money, our ideas, our labor. In the face of all of this, we naturally become more self-absorbed and defensive—we have to look after our own interests, since nobody else will. We set up walls around ourselves to keep out intruders and those who want something from us. (Greene, 2018)
	•	By the time we reach our twenties, we have all developed systems of defense, but in certain circumstances our inner walls can come tumbling down. (Greene, 2018)
	•	What these moments have in common is that we feel inwardly secure—not judged but accepted by friends, the group, or the loved one. We see a reflection of ourselves in others. We can relax. At our core we feel validated. Not needing to turn inward and defensive, we can direct our minds outward, beyond our ego—to a cause, a new idea, or the happiness of the other.Understand: Creating this feeling of validation is the golden key that will unlock people’s defenses. And we cannot survive and thrive in this highly competitive world without possessing such a power. (Greene, 2018)
	•	We must discover the power that we can possess by giving people the validation they crave and lowering their defenses. And the key to making this happen in a realistic and strategic manner is to fully understand a fundamental law of human nature.  This law is as follows: People have a perception about themselves that we shall call their self-opinion. This self-opinion can be accurate or not—it doesn’t matter. What matters is how people perceive their own character and worthiness. And there are three qualities to people’s self-opinion that are nearly universal: “I am autonomous, acting of my own free will”; “I am intelligent in my own way”; and “I am basically good and decent.” (Greene, 2018)
	•	You do this by beginning to disagree with a target about a subject, even with some vehemence, and then slowly come to seeing their point of view, thereby confirming not only their intelligence but also their own powers of influence. They feel ever so slightly superior to you, which is precisely what you want. They will now be doubly vulnerable to a countermove of your own. You can create a similar effect by asking people for advice. The implication is that you respect their wisdom and experience. (…) Lowering people’s defenses in this way on matters that are not so important will give you great latitude to move them in the direction you desire and get them to concede to your desires on more important matters. (Greene, 2018)
Definitive concept
	•	A definitive concept refers precisely to what is common to a class of objects, by the aid of a clear definition in terms of attributes or fixed benchmarks … A sensitizing concept lacks such specification of attributes or benchmarks … Instead, it gives the use a general sense of reference and guidance in approaching empirical instances. Whereas definitive concepts provide prescriptions of what to see, sensitizing concepts merely suggest directions along which to look … (in a) self-correcting relation with its empirical world so that its proposals about that world can be tested, refined and enriched by the data of the world (Blumer, 1969:147-148) (Corbetta, 2003)
Delphi survey
	•	Delphi surveys encourage respondents away from narrow subjectivity by asking them to reforecast a few times, each time after a revelation of the precious round’s forecasts (traditionally only the median and interquartile range are revealed, thereby ignoring outliers). Interpersonal influences are eliminated by keeping each respondent anonymous to any other. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	This method helps respondents to consider wider empirical knowledge while discounting extreme judgments and to converge on a more realistic forecast. (Newsome, 2013)
Delusional process
	•	we humans possess a weakness that is latent in us all and will push us into the delusional process without our ever being aware of the dynamic. The weakness stems from our natural tendency to overestimate our skills. We normally have a self-opinion that is somewhat elevated in relation to reality. We have a deep need to feel ourselves superior to others in something— intelligence, beauty, charm, popularity, or saintliness. This can be a positive. A degree of confidence impels us to take on challenges, to push past our supposed limits, and to learn in the process. But once we experience success on any level—increased attention from an individual or group, a promotion, funding for a project—that confidence will tend to rise too quickly, and there will be an ever-growing discrepancy between our self-opinion and reality. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Any success that we have in life inevitably depends on some good luck, timing, the contributions of others, the teachers who helped us along the way, the whims of the public in need of something new. Our tendency is to forget all of this and imagine that any success stems from our superior self. We begin to assume we can handle new challenges well before we are ready. After all, people have confirmed our greatness with their attention, and we want to keep it coming. We imagine we have the golden touch and that we can now magically transfer our skills to some other medium or field. Without realizing it,we become more attuned to our ego and our fantasies than to the people we work for and our audience. We grow distant from those who are helping us, seeing them as tools to be used. And with any failures that occur we tend to blame others. Success has an irresistible pull to it that tends to cloud our minds. (Greene, 2018)
Demagogues
	•	Be aware of demagogues who exploit the group effect and stimulate outbreaks of irrationality. They inevitably resort to certain devices. In a group setting, they begin by warming up the crowd, talking about ideas and values that everyone shares, creating a pleasant feeling of agreement. They rely on vague but loaded words full of emotive quality such as justice or truth or patriotism. They talk of abstract, noble goals rather than the solving of specific problems with concrete action. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Demagogues in politics or the media try to stir a continual sense of panic, urgency, and outrage. They must keep the emotional levels high. Your defense is simple: Consider your reasoning powers, your ability to think for yourself, your most precious possession. Resent any kind of intrusion upon your independent mind by others. When you feel you are in the presence of demagogue, become doubly wary and analytical. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Salesmen and demagogues play on this weakness in human nature to con us with the prospect of easy gains and instant gratification. (Greene, 2018)
	•	These are relatively harmless forms of release, but there are more dangerous ones, particularly in the realm of politics. We find ourselves increasingly drawn to leaders who give vent to this dark side, who express the hostility and resentment we all secretly feel. They say things we would dare not say. In the safety of the group and rallied to some cause, we have license to project and vent our spleen on various convenient scapegoats. By idealizing the leader and the cause, we are now free to act in ways we would normally shy away from as individuals. These demagogues are adept at exaggerating the threats we face, painting everything in black-and-white terms. They stir up the fears, insecurities, and desires for revenge that have gone underground but are waiting at any moment to explode in the group setting. We will find more and more such leaders as we experience greater degrees of repression and inner tension. (Greene, 2018)
	•	demagogues can stir it against certain individuals or groups of people who have or seem to have it easier than others. (Greene, 2018)
	•	L'art de parler aux foules est d'ordre inférieur sans doute, mais exige des aptitudes toutes spéciales. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Le type du héros cher aux foules aura toujours la structure d'un César. Son panache les séduit, son autorité leur impose et son sabre leur fait peur. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	L'orateur, en communication intime avec la foule, sait évoquer les images qui la séduisent. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	C'est sur l'imagination populaire qu'est fondée la puissance des conquérants et la force des États. C'est surtout en agissant sur elle qu'on entraîne les foules. Tous les grands faits historiques, la création du Bouddhisme, du Christianisme, de l'Islamisme, la Réforme, la Révolution, et, de nos jours, l'invasion menaçante du Socialisme, sont les conséquences directes ou lointaines d'impressions fortes produites sur l'imagination des foules. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	tous les grands hommes d'État de tous les âges et de tous les pays, y compris les plus absolus despotes, ont-ils considéré l'imagination populaire comme la base de leur puissance, et jamais ils n'ont essayé de gouverner contre elle. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Ce ne sont donc pas les faits en eux-mêmes qui frappent l'imagination populaire, mais bien la façon dont ils sont répartis et présentés. Il faut que par leur condensation, si je puis m'exprimer ainsi, ils produisent une image saisissante qui remplisse et obsède l'esprit. Qui connaît l'art d'impressionner l'imagination des foules connaît aussi l'art de les gouverner. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Une des fonctions les plus essentielles des hommes d'État consiste donc à baptiser de mots populaires, ou au moins neutres, les choses que les foules ne peuvent supporter avec leurs anciens noms. La puissance des mots est si grande qu'il suffit de désigner par des termes bien choisis les choses les plus odieuses pour les faire accepter des foules. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	L'art des gouvernants, comme celui des avocats, consiste surtout à savoir manier les mots. Une des grandes difficultés de cet art est que, dans une même société, les mêmes mots ont le plus souvent des sens fort différents pour les diverses couches sociales. Elles emploient en apparence les mêmes mots; mais elles ne parlent jamais la même langue. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Nous reconnaissons ici tous les facteurs de persuasion que nous avons décrits. Nous allons les retrouver encore dans l'action des mots et des formules dont nous avons déjà montré le magique empire. L'orateur qui sait les manier conduit à volonté les foules où il veut. Des expressions telles que l'infâme capital, les vils exploiteurs, l'admirable ouvrier, la socialisation des richesses, etc., produisent toujours le même effet, bien qu'un peu usés déjà. Mais le candidat qui trouve une formule neuve, bien dépourvue de sens précis, et par conséquent pouvant répondre aux aspirations les plus diverses, obtient un succès infaillible. La sanglante révolution espagnole de 1873 a été faite avec un de ces mots magiques, au sens complexe, que chacun peut interpréter à sa façon. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Les meneurs ont tout intérêt à verser dans les plus invraisemblables exagérations. L'orateur, dont je viens de citer une phrase, a pu affirmer, sans soulever de grandes protestations, que les banquiers et les prêtres soudoyaient les lanceurs de bombes, et que les administrateurs des grandes compagnies financières méritent les mêmes peines que les anarchistes. Sur les foules, de pareilles affirmations agissent toujours. L'affirmation n'est jamais trop furieuse, ni la déclamation trop menaçante. Rien n'intimide plus les auditeurs que cette éloquence. En protestant, ils craignent de passer pour traîtres ou complices. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Il est quelquefois effrayant de songer au pouvoir que donne à un homme possédant du prestige une conviction forte unie à une extrême étroitesse d'esprit. Il faut pourtant réaliser ces conditions pour ignorer les obstacles et savoir vouloir. D'instinct les foules reconnaissent dans ces convaincus énergiques le maître qu'il leur faut toujours. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	The sympathy between the orator and his audience is not one which the orator can create. He can intensify it, or by tactless speaking he can dissipate it, but he cannot manufacture it from thin air. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
Democratic elitism
	•	The theory of democratic elitism argues that liberalism can only be secured when an enlightened elite is in power and when it is susceptible to pressure by a counter elite. (Webler and Renn, 1995)
Democracy
	•	Democracy is inevitably messy, in part because the availability and affect heuristics that guide citizens’ beliefs and attitudes are inevitably biased, even if they generally point in the right direction. Psychology should inform the design of risk policies that combine the experts’ knowledge with the public’s emotions and intuitions. (Kahneman, 2012)
Denial
Vehement denial
	•	According to Freud, the only way that something unpleasant or uncomfortable in our unconscious can reach the conscious mind is through active denial. We express the very opposite of what is buried within. This could be a person fulminating against homosexuality, when in fact he or she feels the opposite. (Greene, 2018)
	•	You must reinterpret the denials as positive expressions of Shadow desires. (Greene, 2018)
Depoliticization
Depoliticization of intelligence
	•	The way to keep a single best estimate depoliticized, however, is to split differences and reduce judgments to lowest common denominators— which transmutes analysis into mush. This renders the product useless and is a form of distortion in its own right—just one that is politically neutral. (Betts, 2007)
Depression
	•	Depression and anxiety come from not being your complete self, from always playing a role. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Our society often considers and appropriate sadness to be depression requiring fixing. (Kübler-Ross and Kessler, 2005)
	•	Treatening depression is a balancing act. (Kübler-Ross and Kessler, 2005)
Clinical depression
	•	Clinical depression is a group of illnesses that may be characterized by a long-term or excessively depressed state. (Kübler-Ross and Kessler, 2005)
Normal depression
	•	Normal depression is the sadness we feel at certain times in our lives, the common cold of mental illnesses. (Kübler-Ross and Kessler, 2005)
Depressive cycle
	•	Depressive cycles can serve positive purposes. The solution is to realize their usefulness and temporary quality. The depression you feel today will not be with you in a week, and you can ride it out. If possible, find ways to elevate your energy level, which will physically help lift you out of the mood. (Greene, 2018)
Disinterestedly
	•	le désintéressement est le plus beau rayon de soleil auquel puisse reluire une noble épée. (Dumas, 1998)
Desirability
	•	People may point to all of this as evidence that we humans are becoming more honest and truthful, but human nature does not change within a few generations. People have become more obvious and forthright not out of some deep moral calling but out of increasing self-absorption and overall laziness. It requires no effort to simply be oneself or to blast one’s message. And the lack of effort simply results in a lack of effect on other people’s psychology. It means that people’s interest in you will be paper thin. Their attention will quickly move on and you will not see the reason for this. Do not swallow the easy moralism of the day, which urges honesty at the expense of desirability. Go in the opposite direction. With so few people out there who understand the art of desirability, it affords you endless opportunities to shine and exploit people’s repressed fantasies. (Greene, 2018)
	•	it is not possession but desire that secretly impels people. To possess something inevitably brings about some disappointment and sparks the desire for something new to pursue. You are preying upon the human need for fantasies and the pleasures of chasing after them. In this sense your efforts must be continually renewed. Once people get what they want or possess you, your value and their respect for you immediately begin to lower. Keep withdrawing, surprising, and stimulating the chase. As long as you do, you have the power. (Greene, 2018)
Deterministic world
	•	A world is deterministic if its current state completely defines its future. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
Deterrence
	•	"deterrence" points to the ambiguity of this situation, in which the weapon replaces the protection of armor, in which the possibilities of offense and offensive ensure in and of themselves the defense, the entire defensive against the "explosive" dimension of strategic arms, but not at all against the "implosive" dimension of the vectors' performances, since on the contrary the maintenance of a credible "strike power" requires the constant refining of the engines' power, in other words of their ability to reduce geographic space to nothing or almost nothing. (Virilio, 2006)
	•	‘deterrence’ doctrines, going back to Bentham and Beccaria, rely on the credibility of penalties or punishment, expressed in the ‘expected cost’ of non-compliance to violators, to prevent those regulated from breaking the rules. (Hood et al., 2001)
	•	Deterring the threat means dissuading the hazard from becoming a threat. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Detterring the threats would reduce the frequency of negative events. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	deterrence was grounded in attribution. (Coker, 2009)
	•	Deterrence cannot be reduced to calculations of (pseudo-) scientifically quantifiable credible menace. Rationality and reason are different concepts that complicate the problems for strategists. (Gray, 2014)
	•	Uncertainty and secrecy sometimes work for deterrence purposes. (Choi, 1996)
	•	Deterrence may be provocative in certain contexts. (Hopple, 1984)
Détournement
	•	Debord introduces the practice of détournement and its role in the anti-spectacular struggle. Détournement is the practice of taking an already-existing expression and re-presenting it to change its meaning. Relatively straightforward examples of détournement include ad-busting and subvertising, billboard liberation and spoof reproductions. (Debord, 2012)
	•	‘Détournement’, Debord writes, ‘is the flexible language of anti-ideology’[12]. To recognise the role of détournement in this book is to recognise the undoing, however transiently, of the spectacle’s operations. (Debord, 2012)
	•	Where recuperation makes radical things benign, détournement makes benign or even reactionary things radical; détournement exacerbates the contradictions that the spectacle attempts to smooth over. ‘Détournement’, Debord writes, ‘is the flexible language of anti-ideology’[12]. To recognise the role of détournement in this book is to recognise the undoing, however transiently, of the spectacle’s operations. (Debord, 2012)
	•	Détournement characterises the practises of many of those who have learnt from the Situationist International. It is a tactic not restricted to purely aesthetic practices. Computer hackers and direct action activists are two groups, for example, whose practices frequently involve interventions that challenge the meaning of something otherwise taken for granted. Leaked ‘intelligence’ documents and the queried legitimacy of powerful institutions—such interventions détourn the spectacle’s operations, reveal its fissures and falsities while at the same time the antagonists maintain a necessarily covert presence. (Debord, 2012)
Development
	•	Development itself has become a strategic tool of conflict resolution, as well as a medium of social reconstruction. (Coker, 2009)
Deviation
	•	Deviation from plan, for example, may be a "normal" element in the development of most projects and our response to these deviations—efforts to "stabilize the situation" (Hallgren and Soderholm, 2010)—can be viewed as an important, but relatively commonly-applied component of the project development process (Tin and Levitt, 1996; On and Scott, 2008). (Pinto, 2014) 
	•	The critical nature of deviation in this sense lies in assessing how effectively an organization reacts to unexpected events; i.e., how quickly they are able to get a project back on track with minimal lost time or expense. (Pinto, 2014)

Diagnoses
Correct diagnoses
	•	Correct diagnoses provide opportunities to learn. (Fischhoff, 2013)
Misdiagnoses 
	•	Misdiagnoses can compound problems if they lead to blaming communication partners, rather than communication processes, for failures (46). (Fischhoff, 2013)
Diagnostic
Diagnosticity of evidence. 
	•	It refers to the extent to which any item of evidence helps the analyst determine the relative likeli- hood of alternative hypotheses.(Heuer, 1999)
Diagram
	•	Diagrams includes causal diagrams, influence diagrams, flow charts, and cognitive maps. (Heuer, 1999)
Dialect
	•	questions about the emergence and persistence of distinct languages and dialects fit this format. It is plausible that dialects induce boundaries of trust, making a distinction between ‘us’ and ‘them’. This, of course, depends upon the agents’ rules and how, in an almost geographic sense, they form groups. (Holland, 2014)
Dialectic
	•	Dialectics, however, is nothing else than the science of the general laws of motion and development in nature, human society and thought. (Feyerabend, 1993)
Dicing
	•	But the cultural importance of dicing runs even deeper than this might suggest, providing a way of ‘modelling’ the hazards of trade, politics and war, or even the construction of national identity. (Beard, 2011)
	•	In our own cultural repertoire the phrase has become a slogan for ‘the point of no return’: as if Caesar was saying that civil war was now inevitable and there was no going back. But that, surely, is to misinterpret what Caesar had in mind. By choosing the metaphor of the dice, he was parading the uncertainty, the hazard, and the danger of the political and military outcome. (Beard, 2011)
Dichotomous vision of reality
	•	[…] ‘dichotomous vision of reality’ – that is to say, the tendency to interpret the forces operating in the social field in terms of ‘opposing fronts … two sides, one of which is good and is identified with, and the other of which is the enemy to be fought and, if possible, defeated and destroyed’ (1967: 381) (Corbetta, 2003)
	•	[…] ‘dichotomous vision of reality’ is a conceptual category created by the researchers and is interposed like a screen between the person who read the table and the true mental categories of the interviewee. Moreover, behind this elementary concept there lies a wealth of information that is difficult to imagine for anyone who only read the table. (Corbetta, 2003)
Diactatorship
	•	This dictatorship must be accompanied by permanent violence.  (Debord, 2012)
Dignity
	•	From early on in life we humans develop a defensive and self-protective side to our personality. It begins in early childhood as we cultivate a sense of personal physical space that others should not violate. It later expands into a feeling of personal dignity—people should not coerce or manipulate us into doing things we don’t want to. We should be free to choose what we desire. (Greene, 2018)
Dillution effect
	•	This results when we do not have good exposure information and groups of workers with different exposures therefore get lumped together. When a small group of heavily exposed workers is diluted in a large group of other, less heavily exposed workers, a large excess for the heavily exposed workers can seem smaller than it actually is or even disappear entirely. (Michaels, 2008)
Directive
Cost-oblivious directive
	•	The "cost- oblivious" directive weights public health and safety so heavily as to exclude all other considerations, whether related to economic costs or other competing benefits. (Matheny and Williams, 1984)
Cost-effective directive
	•	"Cost-effective" directives set certain health and safety values as goals to be attained, not at all costs, but as efficiently as possible. (Matheny and Williams, 1984)
Cost-sensitive directive
	•	"Cost-sensitive" is the most problemmatic of the four types, because it calls for the achievement of only those benefits that can be attained within certain cost constraints other than economic efficiency. (Matheny and Williams, 1984)
Cost-benefit directive
	•	"Cost-benefit" directives resemble economic decision criteria, in which the costs and benefits of regulation are compared indifferently. If the benefits outweigh the costs, then regulation should proceed. (Matheny and Williams, 1984)
Disaster
	•	when a disaster occurs in a contemporary setting, it is a particularly threatening failure, because it seems to indicate that the rational mode of thought and action which we have been relying on to control the world has failed (Turner and Pidgeon, 1997)
	•	Thus disasters are occasioned by energy plus misinformation. (Turner and Pidgeon, 1997)
	•	Energy and information are the two elements needed to bring about desired purposive transformations of the world; and, in consequence, they are also the two essential elements needed to describe the way in which inadvertent, unintended transformations of the world come about (Turner and Pidgeon, 1997)
	•	Borrowing Wilensky's (1967) term, Turner (i976a, b) characterizes disasters as organizational "failures of foresight" and asserts that they are the product of an "incubation" period
in disaster development. The common causal features of this period
are erroneous assumptions, information handling difficulties, unattended violations of existing precautions, and a reluctance to fear the worst outcome. These features lead to operational and procedural errors which accumulate unnoticed until a precipitating event produces the disaster and a degree of cultural collapse. Cultural readjustments after the disaster allow the ill-structured problem which led to the failure to be absorbed into the culture in a well-structured form. (Stech, 1979)
	•	Disasters are distinguished from accidents by Turner. Disasters disrupt the social context by unleashing destructive forces in the physical environment and by producing psychological disruptions which provoke the question "How could such a thing come to happen?" Disasters threaten a major part of society with unwanted and unpredicted consequences as a result of a failure of foresight. A disaster may consist, of a single disruptive event followed by many repercussions, or a series of events in close succession producing successive surprises and the need for successive readjustments. (Stech, 1979)
	•	[…] while disasters can be neither predicted nor explained before or immediate after the fact. (Stech, 1979)
	•	Turner asserts that disasters are potentially foreseeable and avoidable but this potential is not recognized until wide-spread re-examinations of the disaster's antecedents and consequences have been made. This potential for prediction and avoidance exits because disasters, unlike accidents, are the result of long complex chain of error errors, inaccuracies, and inadequacies in accepted norms, beliefs, and practices. Turner writes (1976a, 195) that disasters "are not c created overnight ... (they) need the unwitting assistance offered by access to the resources and resource flows of large organizations and time … Small-scale failure [accidents] can be produced very rapidly, but large-scale failure [i.e, disaster] can only be produce if time and resources are devoted to them”. (Stech, 1979)
	•	In terms of disasters, physical location is a major factor, but attributes such as socioeconomic class, age, gender, race-ethnicity, and local culture contribute to vulnerability. (Gill et al., 2012)
	•	The UN Office for International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (ISDR) (2009) defines disaster without any reference to either human or natural sources, as “a serious disruption of a community or a society involving widespread human, material, economic, or environmental losses and impacts, which exceeds the ability of the affected community or society to cope using its own resources” (p. 4). (Newsome, 2013)
	•	[…] it defines disaster as an “emergency (usually but not exclusively of natural causes) causing, or threatening to cause, widespread and serious disruption to community life through death, injury, and/or damage to property and/or the environement” (U.K. Cabinet Office, 2013). (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Disasters always stimulate organizational changes designed to avert the same failures in the future. In some cases these changes work. In many instances, however, they persist formally but erode substantively. (Betts, 2007)

Disaster Development Sequence 
	•	Turner (1976a, b) has constructed a sequence of disaster development that includes the events which lead to disaster and identified specific features of predisaster stages.
Technological disasters
	•	Technological disasters highlight issues associated with vulnerability to hazardous substances, and evidence suggests that higher levels of exposure—including perceptions of exposure—contributes to increased levels of stress. (Gill et al., 2012)
	•	Technological disasters have an identifiable “primary responsible party” (PRP), providing a focus for blame and compensation as well as anger, frustration, fear, and hostility. Although focus is on the PRP, other organizations, including the government, usually share some culpability. (Gill et al., 2012)
	•	Technological disasters tend to create chronic uncertainty, particularly with respect to health effects, economic impacts, extent of environmental damage and recovery, fair and just reparations, and sociocultural recovery and closure. Perceptions of increased, uncontrolled risk contribute to chronic uncertainty, pose threats to ontological security, and add to anxiety and psychological stress (Giddens, 1990, 1991). (Gill et al., 2012)
Oil spill disasters
	•	Oil spill disasters illustrate a type of vulnerability based on dependence on environmental resources damaged or threatened by the oil and cleanup response. (Gill et al., 2012)
Discomfort
	•	Enough signs of discomfort indicated secret hostility. (Greene, 2018)
Discourse
	•	The language in which this discourse is carried out can be clas- sical, or relativistic, or ordinary. (Feyerabend, 1993)
Disease
	•	the development of an infectious disease like AIDS is strongly influenced by the pattern of nonprotected sexual relations within a population. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
Display
Graphical display
	•	Climate scientists use graphical displays to show the relative importance of different physical contributions to global warming, together with the uncertainty associated with each contribution. In order to create this display, researchers first identify each separate physical phenomenon thought to contribute to global warming, and use mathematical models to express that contribution as a ‘‘radiative forcing,’’ i.e., a positive or negative power density over the surface of the Earth. (Weiss, 2008)
Desinformation
	•	They note that the constant possibility of disinformation forces intelligence officers to assess their sources’ credibility, especially HUMINT (human intelligence) sources, against the veracity of their predictions. Thus, ‘‘false alarms’’ paradoxically reduce the source’s credibility, although the information may be true (i.e., not disinformation). (Honig, 2007)
	•	Environmentalists, somewhat like intelligence analysts, sometimes face disinformation put out to the public, in this case by opponents of one or another regulation. Scientists detect such disinformation rather easily, but often have difficulty refuting them convincingly before a general audience. The resulting frustration resembles that felt by intelligence analysts—or their policymaker clients— when they cannot refute misinformation in the press. (Weiss, 2008)

Disciplinary biases
	•	Disciplinary biases could drive experts within a particular domain to misestimate, leaving us with a dilemma about whether to believe the in-domain or out-domain experts. (Newsome, 2013)
Disclosure
	•	Disclosure provides a relatively cost effective means of influencing opinion and reducing any legitimacy gap (Cormier & Gordon 2001). It can also be argued that remedial action without disclosure is not enough to repair legitimacy, because relevant publics need to be informed about actual changes before their perceptions can change. Therefore, corporate disclosure strategies are important legitimising/perception management tools. (Summerhays and de Villiers, 2012) 
	•	Full disclosure is sometimes used in hopes of hiding inconvenient facts in plain sight, by burying them in irrelevant ones (Fischhoff, 2013)
Discourse
	•	Practices are performed within the context of discourses—structured collections of texts and discursive practices (Phillips, Lawrence, & Hardy, 2004) that define “who and what is ‘normal,’ standard and acceptable” (Meriläinen, Tienari, Thomas, & Davies, 2004: 544) and position actors in such a way that not all warrant voice (Hardy & Phillips, 1999). (Maguire and Hardy, 2013)
	•	Discourse constrains “the strategies and rules by which we can speak about and act on a domain of objects . . . in such a way that certain possibilities and outcomes are realized rather than others” (Reed, 1998: 196). (Maguire and Hardy, 2013)
	•	In the case of risk, the pervasiveness of realist approaches has led to a dominance of a discourse that privileges formal, scientific knowledge, empower- ing some people as experts and dismissing others as inexpert. The discursive model [of risk] also views knowledge about risk as socially constructed, but it emphasizes the role of professional languages (such as quantitative risk assessment) and analytic practices (such as cost-benefit analysis) in shaping public perceptions of risk. Authoritative knowledge is created in this framework by people or institutions that master the relevant formal discourses, which, however, importantly constrain even the experts’ perceptions of risk. (Jasanoff, 1998: 94). (Maguire and Hardy, 2013)
	•	Discourses are, however, never completely cohesive: they are always partial, inconsistent, and contested to some degree and, therefore, never able to determine social reality fully (Hardy & Phillips, 2004). (Maguire and Hardy, 2013)
Organizational discourses
	•	organizational discourses frame risk management and governance ideas in rhetorics of opportunity and in appeals to a neoliberal morality of enterprise. (Power, 2009)
Discourse analysis
	•	the discourse analysis and ethnographic traditions make use of more 'qualitative' and 'descriptive' methods. (Ellis, 2006)
	•	Discourse analysis serves as a device for systematically describing the kinds of interactions that occur in language classrooms. (Ellis, 2006)
Discourse analysts
	•	[…] discourse analysts give attention not only to the function of individual utterances but also to how these utterances combine to form larger discoursal units. (Ellis, 2006)
Discussion
Informal discussion
	•	Informal discussions tend to be misled by those most powerful in the perceptions of group memebers and by mutually reactionary, extreme positions. (Newsome, 2013)
Discursive democray
	•	Discursive democracy is woven here from threads supplied by a classical (Aristotelian) model of politics, participatory, communicative action, practical reason, and critical theory. (Dryzek, 1994)
	•	Ultimatly, discursive democray looks forward to a world of free and congenial political interaction where politics, properly understood, is returned to its Aristotelian primacy in the order of thigs. (Dryzek, 1994)
	•	Discursive democracy charts escapes from some contemporary impasses in political arrangements, public policy, and social science. (Dryzek, 1994)
Disjunction
	•	Disjunctions leads to underestimation. (Tversky and Kahneman, 1974)
Disjunctive structures
	•	disjunctive structures are typically encountered in the evaluation of risks. (Tversky and Kahneman, 1974)
Disorder
	•	“Ordre et désordre ne se séparents pas”, souligne G. Balandier (1988, p. 12). Même lorsqu’il n’y paraît pas, dans les sociétés traditionnelles notamment qui sont des sociétés d’ordre, le désordre poursuit son “travail cache” et, à tout moment, “le désordre peut se traduite en ordre par l’effet de l’imaginaire, du symbolique et des pratiques ritualiséees. Le pouvoir lui-même y apparaît comme une machine qui a la capacité de traiter le désordre et de le convertir en énergie poisitive” (ibid.). (Mannoni, 1985)
Dispute
	•	Disputes can highlight the social contradictions inherent in many decisions about science and technology, and the problems of developing public policies in the absence of definitive agreement about potential risks. They can reveal the ethical conundrums involved in choices where conflicting values are at stake. And they can reveal the ideologies and values that turn policy differences into deep moral dilemmas. (Nelkin, 1992)
Dispute assessment 
	•	A dispute assessment seeks to defme the disputants, the nature of the dispute, possible infonnation needs of disputants, and the likelihood of the parties reaching accord. (Baughman, 1995)
	•	Dispute assessments conducted by the mediator may be essential to helping the parties decide whether to proceed with a voluntary dispute resolution process. (Baughman, 1995)
Disrupt
	•	By disrupt we mean the output ceases or decreases to the extent that prompt repairs will be required (Perrow, 1999)
Disruption
	•	A disruption is “a disturbance that compromises the availability, delivery, and/or integrity of services of an organization” (Public Safety Canada, 2012, p. 28). (Newsome, 2013)
Disruptive intelligence
	•	Normatively, the corrective to these tendencies is what Turner has called enigmatically ‘disruptive intelligence’, which is the capacity to challenge notional normalities and deviant operating habits. (Adler et al., 2014)
Dissymmetry
	•	dissymmetry principle: an effect cannot have a dissymmetry absent from its cause. Dissymmetry is lack of symmetry, so we can rephrase this as ‘The symmetry of the causes must be reproduced in the effects.’ (Stewart, 2013)
DNA
	•	The DNA—the deoxyribonucleic acid molecule packed in the nucleus of the cell, that contains the genes—was dubbed the ‘software of life’, the program responsible for every single feature of a living being, the code whose dysfunction caused all the diseases. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
	•	The software metaphor did not stand in the face of this evidence: the DNA sequence alone does not explain the observed differences between species, let alone all the features and diseases of a single individual. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
	•	Genes contained in the DNA are transcribed and translated to produce proteins. Proteins play a central role in almost every aspect of life: muscle movement, blood circulation, acting as enzymes, binding to hormones, etc. Moreover, proteins interact with each other: the production of a protein can be facilitated or hindered by the presence of other proteins in the cell. The delicate balance of these reciprocal influences is crucial for life. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
Doctor
Medical doctor
	•	Traditionally, doctors were guardians of a knowledge that their patients found arcane; they neither had access to it, nor did they understand it. (Coker, 2009)
	•	Doctors stood between the civilian world and access to medical understanding. They were not experts as we understand the term today. They had status, not competence. It was not possible to acquire their knowledge without a ‘vocation’ − that is what conferred status upon them. Their knowledge was not communicable to the outsider. (Coker, 2009)
	•	The skill of the doctor was a craft taught by apprenticeship in the field and experience, plus intuition (the doctor was ultimately not a healer but a diagnostician) and the knowledge claims he incorporated were protected as arcane and esoteric (Giddens 1994:63). (Coker, 2009)
Doctrine
	•	Doctrine is a notable enabler of, and guide for, strategies. (Gray, 2014)
Dogma
	•	Dès qu'un dogme nouveau est implanté dans l'âme des foules, il devient l'inspirateur de ses institutions, de ses arts et de sa conduite. L'empire qu'il exerce alors sur les âmes est absolu. Les hommes d'action ne songent qu'à le réaliser, les législateurs ne font que l'appliquer, les philosophes, les artistes, les littérateurs ne sont préoccupés que de le traduire sous des formes diverses. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Mais ces objections théoriquement excellentes perdent pratiquement toute force, si l'on veut se souvenir de la puissance invincible des idées transformées en dogmes. Le dogme de la souveraineté des foules est, au point de vue philosophique, aussi peu défendable que les dogmes religieux du moyen âge, mais il en a aujourd'hui l'absolue puissance. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Le dogme du suffrage universel possède aujourd'hui le pouvoir qu'eurent jadis les dogmes chrétiens. Orateurs et écrivains en parlent avec un respect et des adulations que n'a pas connus Louis XIV. Il faut donc se conduire à son égard comme à l'égard de tous les dogmes religieux. Le temps seul agit sur eux. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Ce n'est pas parce qu'un individu sait le grec ou les mathématiques, est architecte, vétérinaire, médecin ou avocat, qu'il acquiert sur les questions sociales des clartés particulières. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	even laws based upon geographical conditions that have been changed for more than a thousand years are still maintained in the logic-proof compartment of dogmatic adherence. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
Dominance
	•	As the most complex social animal on the planet, we humans form elaborate hierarchies based on position, money, and power. We are aware of these hierarchies, but we do not like talking explicitly about relative power positions, and we are generally uncomfortable when others talk about their superior rank. Instead, signs of dominance or weakness are more often expressed in nonverbal communication. We have inherited this communication style from other primates, notably chimpanzees, who have elaborate signals to denote an individual chimp’s place in the social rank. Keep in mind that the feeling of being in a superior social position gives people a confidence that will radiate outward in their body language. Some feel this confidence before they attain a position of power, and it becomes a Self-fulfilling prophecy as others are drawn to them. Some who are ambitious might try to simulate these cues, but it has to be done well. Fake confidence can be quite off-putting. (Greene, 2018)
	•	People’s actions will often contain dominance and submission cues. (Greene, 2018)
Dominance principle
	•	dominance principle, a useful heuristic for making decisions under conditions of risk and uncertainty. (Covello and Mumpower, 1986)
Dominant group
	•	There are four basic types of feeling that seem to be always present in race preducie in the dominant group. They are (1) a feeling of superiority, (2) a feeling that the subordinate race is intrinsically differenet and alien, (3) a feeling of proprietary claim to certain areas of privilege and advantage, and (4) a frear and suspicion that the subordinate race harbors designs on the prerogatives of the dominant race. (Blumer, 1958)
Domination
	•	soyez superbe, monsieur ; c'est la loi des dominations. (Dumas, 1998)
	•	Domination today is not a product of armies or navies or wealth or policies. It is a domination based on the one hand upon accomplished unity, and on the other hand upon the fact that opposition is generally characterized by a high degree of disunity. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	The disunity of forces which seek to overthrow dominant groups is illustrated every day in every phase of our lives—political, moral and economic. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
Domino effect
	•	Domino effects are not uncommon in foodwebs. Networks in general provide the backdrop for large-scale, sudden, and surprising dynamics. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
Dose
Dose response assessment
	•	Dose response assessment is the process of characterizing the relation between the dose of an agent administered or received and the incidence of an adverse health effect in exposed populations and estimating the incidence of the effect as a function of exposure to the agent. This process considers such important factors as intensity of exposure, age pattern of exposure, and possibly other variables that might affect response, such as sex, lifestyle, and other modifying factors. (Paustenbach, 2002c)
	•	A dose-response assessment should describe and justify the methods of extrapolation used to predict incidence, and it should characterize the statistical and biologic uncertainties in these methods. When possible, the uncertainties should be described numerically rather than qualitatively. (Paustenbach, 2002c)
Applied dose
	•	Applied dose is the amount of chemical available at the absorption barrier (skin. lung. gastrointestinal tract). It is useful to know the applied dose relationship can be established between the applied dose and the internal dose, a relationship that can sometimes be established experimentally. This relationship can be estimated either through modeling or by direct measurement. (Paustenbach, 2002a)
Potential dose
	•	Potential dose is simply the amount of chemical that is ingested or inhaled, or the amount of chemical contained in material applied to the skin. It is a useful term or concept in those -instances when them is a measurable amount of chemical or transport medium, such as eating a certain amount of food or applying a certain amount of material to the skin. (Paustenbach, 2002a)
Internal dose
	•	The amount of chemical that has been absorbed and is available for interaction with biologically significant receptors (e.g. target organs) is called the internal dose. Estimating internal dose is the first objective of a good exposure assessment. (Paustenbach, 2002a)
Dose estimates
	•	dose estimates should be expressed in a manner that can be compared with available dose-response data from animal or human studies. (Paustenbach, 2002a)

Dramatic effect
	•	This mostly involves mastering the art of presence/absence. If you are too present, if people see you too often or can predict exactly what you will do next, they will quickly grow bored with you. You must know how to selectively absent yourself, to regulate how often and when you appear before others, making them want to see more of you, not less. Cloak yourself in some mystery, displaying some subtly contradictory qualities. People don’t need to know everything about you. Learn to withhold information. In general, make your appearances and your behavior less predictable. (Greene, 2018)
	•	We humans tend to live in the moment. It is the animal part of our nature. We respond first and foremost to what we see and hear, to what is most dramatic in an event. (Greene, 2018)
Dread factor 
	•	The term dread clearly suggests that people have a ‘‘gut reaction’’ to a hazard and that such a reaction is the main part of the dynamics of their concern. (Sjöberg, 2006)
	•	the Dread factor is, upon closer inspection, quite heterogenous. It does contain one item which clearly refers to emotional reactions, but the other items refer to severe consequences of the hazard (fatal, children or future generations involved etc.), or even to an assortment of various factors such as fairness or voluntariness. (Sjöberg, 2006)
	•	Nine attributes defining the dread factor were according to Graham (Graham, 2001), in a recent article:- fatal versus non-fatal; global versus local impact; involuntary versus voluntary; uncontrollable versus controllable; unfair versus fair; catastrophic versus unclustered victims; future versus current generations; increasing versus decreasing; not easily reduced versus easily reduced. (Sjöberg, 2006)
	•	The importance of ‘‘Dread’’ is due to the importance of severe consequences, which proves nothing about the role of emotions. (Sjöberg, 2006)
Dream
	•	Le rêve est, en effet, aussi necessaire aux groups qu’aux hommes iséolés.  (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Il est alors loisible au psychologue de déceler derrière l’utopie le desir déçu et l’angoisse sous-jacente. Il s’agi d’une fuite compensatoire et d’un processus de reparation tout à la fois. Effectivement, on sait combien il est difficile au psychisme de supporter l’épreuve de cette « douleur morale » que représente un état d’anxiété latent (ne parlons même pas des crises aiguës). Tout est alors mis en œuvre pour la déjouer, les mensonges, la mauvaise foi, la négation de la réalité, le refus de l’esprit critique, au profit des vertiges de l’imagination consolatrice. C’est probablement ce « besoin de croire », et surtout le « besoin d’être rassuré, sécurité », qui explique pour une bonne part le succès permanent du slogan des « lendemains qui chantent » : quel que soit l’idéologue ou le chef de parti qui l’exploite, il peut escompter un succès certain, car chacun préfère en général un faux espoir qu’un désespour lucide, et la vérité peut avoir des rigueurs insusportaboles. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	L'irréel est dans certains cas plus vrai que le réel. (Lebon, 1895)
Dromocratic intelligence
	•	dromocratic intelligence is not exercised against a more or less determined military adversary, but as a permanent assault on the world, and through it, on human nature. (Virilio, 2006)
Dromocracy
	•	Dromocracy establishes and reproduces standardized forms of assembly and disassembly for the systematic integration of human energy into specific infrastructures. (Bratton, 2006)
	•	Dromocracy depends on technologies that in their employment, straddle the pre-political and the hyperpolitical, working on the bodies of the masses as a practical material that can be strategically designed and deployed (Bratton, 2006)
	•	dromocratic idea: the notion of displacement without destination in space and time. It imposes the primordial idea of disappearance in distance, and no longer in the danger of cataclysm; it rushes non-stop toward the beyond (Virilio, 2006)
Dromomaniacs
	•	dromomaniacs, "couriers of terror" sent forward before the Revolution onto the Parisian pavement (Virilio, 2006)
Dromological progress
	•	dromological progress that ruins progress; it is the permanence of the war of Time that creates total peace, the peace of exhaustion. (Virilio, 2006)
Dromology
	•	"Dromology" (from Gr. dromos: race course) is this government of differential motility, of harnessing and mobilizing, incarcerating and accelerating things and people. (Bratton, 2006)
Duality 
	•	Those who think in dualities – believing that there is such a thing as “real” and such a thing as “unreal,” and that they are distinct entities that can never become blended into a third, alchemical element – are creatively limited, and their work can quickly become dead and predicateble. (Greene, 2014)
	•	To maintain a dualistic approach to life requires that we repress many observable truths, but in our unconscious and in our dreams we often let go of the need to create categories for everything, and are able to mix seemingly disparate and contradictory ideas and feelings together with ease. (Greene, 2014)
Duel
	•	Parce que, monsieur, dit le président, vous avez insulté un homme, et que cet homme ne veut pas faire un pas de plus sans vous demander loyalement réparation. (Dumas, 1998)
	•	comme on dit en termes de tir, était occupé à s'entretenir la main. (Dumas, 1998)
Duration
	•	By definition, duration is the period of time over which the person is exposed. (Paustenbach, 2002a)
Dyadic approaches
	•	‘Dyadic' approaches examine exchange relation- ships between organizations and their environments, in terms of other organizations in supply chains and customer relationships, or in terms of resources and capabilities, such as technology and labour. (Power, 2009)
	•	[…] tend to focus on the individual organization as the strategic entity (Power, 2009) 

Dynamic
	•	the living force that inevitably operates in anything we study or do. It is how the whole thing functions, and how the relationships evolve from within. It is not the moves of the pieces on the chessboard but the entire game, involving the psychologies of the players, their strategies in real time, their past experiences influencing the present, the comfort of the chairs they are sitting in, how their energies affect each oth – in a word, everything that comes into play, all at once. (Greene, 2014)
Deadening dynamic
	•	In arts, someone establishes a style that is new and vibrant, speaking to the particular spirit of the times. It has an edge because it is so different. Soon imitators pop up everywhere It becomes a fasion, something to coform to, even if the conformity appears to be rebellious and edgy. This can drag on for ten, twenty years; it eventually becomes a cliché, pure style without any real emotion or need. Nothing in culture escapes this deadening dynamics. (Greene, 2014)
	•	We may not be aware of it, but we suffer from the dead forms and conventions that clutter our culture. This problem, however, sets up a tremendous opportunity for creative type. (Greene, 2014)
Dynamic nominalism 
	•	ideas are part of a continuous dynamic in which practices get performed and contested under accepted descriptions (Power, 2009)
Dynamical system
	•	Chaos is a property of dynamical systems. And a dynamical system is nothing more than a source of changing observations. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
	•	There are at least three different kinds of dynamical systems. Chaos is most easily defined in mathematical dynamical systems. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
	•	Dynamical systems in which, on average, line segments (or in higher dimensions, areas or volumes) shrink are called dissipative. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
	•	dynamical system has three components: the mathematical rule that defines how to get the next value, the parameter values, and the current state. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
	•	chaos is a property of a dynamical system with fixed equations (structure) and specified parameter values, so the uncertainty that chaos acts on is only the uncertainty in the initial state. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
	•	The evolution of the state of a system is often visualized as a tape passing through a black-box. What happens inside the box depends on what kind of dynamical system we are watching. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
Mathematical dynamical systems
	•	There are at least three different kinds of dynamical systems. Chaos is most easily defined in mathematical dynamical systems. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
	•	These systems consist of a rule: you put a number in and you get a new number out, which you put back in, to get yet a newer number out, which you put back in. And so on. This process is called iteration. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
	•	We commonly find four different types of behaviour in time series. They can (i) grind to a halt and more or less repeat the same fixed number over and over again, (ii) bounce around in a closed loop like a broken record, periodically repeating the same pattern: exactly the same series of numbers over and over, (iii) move in a loop that has more than one period and so does not quite repeat exactly but comes close, like the moment of high tide drifting through the time of day, or (iv) forever jump about wildly, or perhaps even calmly, displaying no obvious pattern. The fourth type looks random, yet looks can be deceiving. Chaos can look random but it is not random. In fact, as we have learned to see better, chaos often does not even look all that random to us anymore. In the next few pages we will introduce several more maps, though perhaps without the rice or rabbits. We need these maps in order to generate interesting artefacts for our tour in search of the various types of behaviour just noted. Some of these maps were generated by mathematicians for this very purpose, although our physicist might argue, with reason, that a given map was derived by simplifying physical laws. In truth, the maps are simple enough to have each come about in several different ways. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
	•	Before we can produce a time series by iterating a map, we need some number to start with. This first number is called an initial condition, an initial state that we define, discover, or arrange for our system to be. As in Chapter 2, we adopt the symbol X as shorthand for a state of our system. The collection of all possible states X is called the state space. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
	•	To see if a mathematical system is deterministic merely requires checking carefully whether carrying out the rule requires a random number. If not, then the dynamical system is deterministic: every time we put the same value of X in, we get the same new value of X out. If the rule requires (really requires) a random number, then the system is random, also called stochastic. With a stochastic system, even if we iterate exactly the same initial condition we expect the details of the next value of X and thus the time series to be different. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
E
Ecological fallacy
	•	Ecological fallacy refers to the error of assuming the relationships between variables at one geographical scale also occur at another scale. 
Ecological studies
	•	Ecological studies have generally been looked upon with disfavor by epidemiologists for reasons that have been extensively discussed elsewhere {Greenland and Morgenstern, 1989; Greenland and Robins. 1994). Nonetheless, they can provide useful information and have played a central role in recent times, particularly in air pollution epidemiology. Because epidemiologic studies are observational (i.e., groups of subjects cannot randomly be as- signed to one or another exposure group). careful attention has to be paid to controlling factors that may bias estimates of risk. (Moolgavkar and Leubeck, 2002)
Economy
Classical economy
	•	Classical economic theories represented economic actors as independent, completely rational agents, focused on maximizing their income. However, facts show that individuals, companies, institutions, and countries are not independent: everyone influences each other in many ways. Their behaviour, far from being completely rational, is strongly dependent on subjectivity, emotions, and reciprocal influence. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
Economic theory
	•	Economic theory does not pretend to offer an account of the place of the individual in society (Douglas, 2005:125)
	•	Economic theory can be as cohesive as it is because of the professional intensity of its discourse and because Western thought is impregnated with the Western experience of market (Douglas, 2005:125)
Economic value
	•	The economic value of a particular fatality can be calculated from past inputs, such as the sunk cost of education, and lost future outputs, such as lost earnings. (Newsome, 2013)
Ecosystem
	•	Ecosystems are complex webs of species: it is crucial to take into account this underlying network structure if we want to understand and manage them.  (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
	•	Ecosystems can be seen as sets of interacting networks; for example, both antagonistic and mutualistic networks play a role in determining how species will thrive. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
	•	In ecosystems, certain groups of species establish small foodwebs, without any connection to external species. In social systems, certain human groups may be totally separated from others. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
	•	The possibility of a sudden transition from a resilient behaviour to a global collapse should ring some alarm bells. In ecosystems, a certain rate of extinction is inevitable: one in each million of species becomes extinct every year, according to some estimates. Usually, foodwebs rearrange after these events, and most of the species do not suffer major damage from these natural extinctions. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
Cultural ecosystem
	•	We humans operate in our own cultural ecosystem. (Greene, 2018)
Ecosystem evolution
	•	the appearance of new species in an evolving ecosystem offers new opportunities for interaction. (Holland, 2014)
	•	Ecosystem studies
	•	in ecosystem studies, the investigation typically centres on the interaction of a designated keystone species with other selected species in its locale (predators, prey, symbionts, etc.). (Holland, 2014)
Education
	•	Education is supposed to help us to recognize problems like “con rmation bias” and to overcome the gaps in our knowledge so that we can be be er citizens. (Nichols, 2017)
	•	l'instruction est capable de changer considérablement les hommes, et a pour résultat certain de les améliorer, et même de les rendre égaux. Par le fait seul de la répétition, cette assertion a fini par devenir un des dogmes les plus inébranlables de la démocrati. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	erreur psychologique fondamentale, que c'est en apprenant par cœur des manuels qu'on développe l'intelligence. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Si cette éducation n'était qu'inutile, on pourrait se borner à plaindre les malheureux enfants auxquels, au lieu de tant de choses nécessaires à apprendre à l'école primaire, on préfère enseigner la généalogie des fils de Clotaire, les luttes de la Neustrie et de l'Austrasie, ou des classifications zoologiques; mais elle présente un danger beaucoup plus sérieux. Elle donne à celui qui l'a reçue un dégoût violent de la condition où il est né, et l'intense désir d'en sortir. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Au lieu de préparer des hommes pour la vie, l'école ne les prépare qu'à des fonctions publiques où l'on peut réussir sans avoir à se diriger ni à manifester aucune lueur d'initiative. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	L'État qui fabrique à coups de manuels tous ces diplômés, ne peut en utiliser qu'un petit nombre et laisse forcément sans emploi les autres. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	la masse immense des diplômés assiège aujourd'hui les carrières. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	C'est le jugement, l'expérience, l'initiative, le caractère qui sont les conditions de succès dans la vie, et ce n'est pas là ce que donnent les livres. Les livres sont des dictionnaires utiles à consulter, mais dont il est parfaitement inutile d'avoir de longs fragments dans la tête. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	De tous ces contacts précieux, de tous ces éléments assimilables et indispensables, le jeune Français est privé, et justement pendant l'âge fécond; sept ou huit années durant, il est séquestré dans une école, loin de l'expérience directe et personnelle qui lui aurait donné la notion exacte et vive des choses, des hommes et des diverses façons de les manier.» (Lebon, 1895)
	•	leurs acquisitions, trop nombreuses et trop lourdes, glissent incessamment hors de leur esprit, et ils n'en font pas de nouvelles. Leur vigueur mentale a fléchi; la sève féconde est tarie; l'homme fait apparaît, et, souvent c'est l'homme fini. Celui-ci, rangé, marié, résigné à tourner en cercle et indéfiniment dans le même cercle, se cantonne dans son office restreint; il le remplit correctement, rien au delà. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Si nous voulons comprendre les idées, les croyances qui y germent aujourd'hui, et qui écloront demain, il faut savoir comment le terrain a été préparé. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Il était donc nécessaire de montrer comment le système actuel l'a façonnée, et comment la masse des indifférents et des neutres est devenue progressivement une immense armée de mécontents, prête à obéir à toutes les suggestions des utopistes et des rhéteurs. (Lebon, 1895)
Anglo-saxon education
	•	L'illustre psychologue nous montre ensuite la différence de notre système avec celui des Anglo-Saxons. Ces derniers ne possèdent pas nos innombrables écoles spéciales; chez eux l'enseignement n'est pas donné par le livre, mais par la chose elle-même. (Lebon, 1895)
Private education
	•	Private education promises better education for one’s children. (Coker, 2009)
Effect
	•	“An effect is a deviation from the expected – positive and/or negative” (Australian and New Zealand Joint Technical Committee, 2009, p. 1). (Newsome, 2013)
Authentic effect
	•	They know that appearing humble, or discussing their private life, or telling an anecdote that reveals some vulnerability will have the “authentic” effect. (Greene, 2018)
Egalitarianism
	•	The egalitarianism scale centers on political solutions to inequality: "Much of the conflict in this world could be eliminated if we had more equal distribution of resources among nations," […]. (Wildavsky and Dake, 1990)
Egalitarian groups
	•	Members of egalitarian groups will seek a moral determination of liability for unforeseen costs that appeals to ranked values, rather than the market or distributive approaches to losses favored by en- trepreneurs or bureaucrats. (Rayner and Cantor, 1987)
	•	Members of egalitarian groups will seek a moral determination of liability for unforeseen costs that appeals to ranked values, rather than the market or distributive approaches to losses favored by entrepreneurs or bureaucrats. (Rayner and Cantor, 1987)
	•	Egalitarians will favor expressed preferences that also appeal to explicit judgments of ranked values (shared by the group) rather than the revealed preference or hypothetical consent approaches favored by the other groups. (Rayner and Cantor, 1987)
	•	Egalitarians distrust both individualists and bureaucracies. The requirement for explicit consent to societal risk talung leads egalitarian groups to trust consensus decision making in participatory institutions such as affinity groups or town meetings. (Rayner and Cantor, 1987)
	•	[…] advocates of greater equality of conditions abhor the roledifferentiation characteristic of hierarchy because ranked stationssignify inequality. Egalitarians reject the prescriptions associated withhierarchy (i.e., who is allowed to do what and with whom), and thus show much less concern about social deviance. (Wildavsky and Dake, 1990)
Ego
	•	Your greatest danger here is your ego and how it makes you unconsciously maintain illusions about yourself. These may be comforting in the moment, but in the long run they make you defensive and unable to learn or progress. Find a neutral position from which you can observe your actions, with a bit of detachment and even humor. (Greene, 2018)
Ego depletion
	•	if you have had to force yourself to do something, you are less willing or less able to exert self-control when the next challenge comes around. The phenomenon has been named ego depletion. 
	•	ego-depleted people therefore succumb more quickly to the urge to quit. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	The list of situations and tasks that are now known to deplete self-control is long and varied. (Kahneman, 2012)
Effort
	•	It is always better to praise people for their effort, not their talent. (Greene, 2018)
Elected leaders
	•	Elected leaders decide. (Nichols, 2017)
Election program
	•	Le programme écrit du candidat ne doit pas être trop catégorique, parce que ses adversaires pourraient le lui opposer plus tard, mais son programme verbal ne saurait être trop excessif. Les réformes les plus considérables peuvent être promises sans crainte. Sur le moment, ces exagérations produisent beaucoup d'effet, et pour l'avenir elles n'engagent en rien. (Lebon, 1895)
Electoral promise
	•	Le programme écrit du candidat ne doit pas être trop catégorique, parce que ses adversaires pourraient le lui opposer plus tard, mais son programme verbal ne saurait être trop excessif. Les réformes les plus considérables peuvent être promises sans crainte. Sur le moment, ces exagérations produisent beaucoup d'effet, et pour l'avenir elles n'engagent en rien. (Lebon, 1895)
Eloquence
Delivery
	•	Delivery has been regarded among all nations, and treated by all Rhetorical writers, as an essential ingredient in eloquence. (Harris, 1809)
Emergence
	•	Emergence itself is a property without a sharp demarcation. (Holland, 2014)
	•	Hierarchical organization is thus closely tied to emergence. Each level of a hierarchy typically is governed by its own set of laws. (Holland, 2014)
	•	emergent properties at any level must be consistent with interactions specified at the lower level(s). (Holland, 2014)
	•	emergent behaviour is an essential requirement for calling a system ‘complex’. (Holland, 2014)
	•	Briefly said, emergence occurs when the generators for a generated system combine to yield objects having properties not obtained by summing properties of the individual generators. (Holland, 2014)
	•	A new boundary typically identifies a new agent, so boundaries are closely associated with emergent phenomena. (Holland, 2014)
	•	questions about the emergence and persistence of distinct languages and dialects fit this format. It is plausible that dialects induce boundaries of trust, making a distinction between ‘us’ and ‘them’. This, of course, depends upon the agents’ rules and how, in an almost geographic sense, they form groups. (Holland, 2014)
	•	Emergence is the primary characteristic that distinguishes complex systems as an important subset of complicated system. (Holland, 2014)
	•	Emergence is tightly tied to the formation of boundaries. These boundaries can arise from symmetry breaking, as in Ising’s bar magnet model or Turing’s model of morphogenesis (Chapter 2), or they can arise by assembly of component building blocks, as in the assembly of semi-permeable membranes from proteins (Chapter 3). For CAS? The agent-defining boundaries determine the interactions between agents. Indeed the agent-defining boundaries act like semi-permeable membranes, admitting some signals and excluding others. Adaptation, and the emergence of new kinds of agents, then arises from changes in the relevant boundaries. (Holland, 2014)
	•	That is some collective behaviour that cannot be predicted by looking at the single elements forming the system. Usually, systems that display these phenomena are dubbed complex systems. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
	•	The performance of a team is a kind of emergent phenomenon, one that does depends not only on the quality of the single players or on the sum of their individual skills, but also on the network of interactions between them. Many emergent phenomena rely crucially on the structure of the underlying networks. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
Emergence of probability
	•	‘emergence of probability’ – the development of the ability to arithmetically to calculate chance. (Beard, 2011)
Emergency
	•	The UN (UN Department of Humanitarian Affairs [DHA], 1992) defines an emergency as “a sudden and usually unforeseen event that calls for immediate measures to minimize its advser consequences.”. (Newsome, 2013)
Catastrophic emergency
	•	The British Civil Contingencies Secretariat defines catastrophic emergency as “an emergency which has an exceptionally high and potentially widespread impact and requires immediate central government direction and support. (Newsome, 2013)
Emergency law
	•	Le second des dangers mentionnés plus haut, la restriction forcée des libertés par les assemblées parlementaires, moins visible en apparence est cependant fort réel. Il est la conséquence des innombrables lois—toujours restrictives—dont les parlements, avec leur esprit simpliste, voient mal les conséquences, et qu'ils se croient obligés de voter. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	indépendant de son électeur, n'a pas réussi à s'y soustraire. Herbert Spencer, dans un travail déjà ancien, avait montré que l'accroissement de la liberté apparente devait être suivi d'une diminution de la liberté réelle. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Cette restriction progressive des libertés se manifeste pour tous les pays sous une forme spéciale, que Herbert Spencer n'a pas indiquée, et qui est celle-ci: La création de ces séries innombrables de mesures législatives, toutes généralement d'ordre restrictif, conduit nécessairement à augmenter le nombre, le pouvoir et l'influence des fonctionnaires chargés de les appliquer. Ils tendent ainsi progressivement à devenir les véritables maîtres des pays civilisés. Leur puissance est d'autant plus grande, que, dans les incessants changements de pouvoir, la caste administrative est la seule qui échappe à ces changements, la seule qui possède l'irresponsabilité, l'impersonnalité et la perpétuité. Or, de tous les despotismes, il n'en est pas de plus lourds que ceux qui se présentent sous cette triple forme. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Cette création incessante de lois et de règlements restrictifs entourant des formalités les plus byzantines les moindres actes de la vie, a pour résultat fatal de rétrécir de plus en plus la sphère dans laquelle les citoyens peuvent se mouvoir librement. Victimes de cette illusion qu'en multipliant les lois l'égalité et la liberté se trouvent mieux assurées, les peuples acceptent chaque jour de plus pesantes entraves. (Lebon, 1895)
Emotion
	•	each emotion is defined by a tendency to perceive new events and objects in ways that are consistent with the original cognitive-appraisal dimensions of the emotion. (Lerner and Keltner, 2000)
	•	each specific emotion (a) is defined by a set of central dimensions and (b) directs cognition to address specific problems or opportunities. (Lerner and Keltner, 2000)
	•	emotional carry-over effects are consistent with the underlying appraisal patterns of each emotion. (Lerner and Keltner, 2000)
	•	If an emotion is relatively high or low on a given dimension, the dimension is considered central to the definition of that emotion and likely to exert in ̄uences on subsequent judgements or choices. In the middle panel, entries indicate the appraisal tendency that is likely to be associated with each emotion. (Lerner and Keltner, 2000)
	•	emotions exert a direct and powerful influence on behavior receives ample support in the psychological literature on emotions. (Loewenstein et al., 2001)
	•	A number of authors have postulated that emotions play a critical role in rational, risk-averse, forward-looking, decision making. (Loewenstein et al., 2001)
	•	emotions respond to the two central input variables of cognitive consequentialist accounts of risk-related perception and behavior —probabilities and outcomes—in a fashion that is different from cognitive evaluations of riskiness. Second, emotions are influenced by situational variables that play only a minor role in cognitive evaluations. (Loewenstein et al., 2001)
	•	Although emotions do respond to cognitive evaluations, they can also arise with minimal cognitive processing (Zajonc, 1980), and people can experience fear reactions without even knowing what they are afraid of. (Loewenstein et al., 2001)
	•	emotions are positive or negative feeling (affect) states consisting of a pattern of cognitive, physiological and behavioral reactions to events that have relevance to important goals or motives [(Passer & Smith, 2001), p. 412]. (Sjöberg, 2006)
	•	Emotion, feeling and affect are seemingly equated. (Sjöberg, 2006)
	•	The notion of emotion as a mental state is roughly similar to the dictionary definition, but the addition that these states ‘‘consist of patterns of ... reactions’’ makes things very unclear, again. (Sjöberg, 2006)
	•	The way emotions are ‘‘proven’’ to be a factor in risk perception is thus by a sort of terminological ‘‘slippery slope’’ involving shifting meanings of terms. (Sjöberg, 2006)
	•	emotion is important in risk perception! (Sjöberg, 2006)
	•	Emotions turn us inward, away from nous, away from reality. (Greene, 2018)
	•	If we look out at the world and try to solve problems, we see things through the lens of these emotions; they cloud our vision. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Emotions tend to narrow the mind, making us focus on one or two ideas that satisfy our immediate desire for power or attention, ideas that usually backfire. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Emotions originate as physical arousal designed to capture our attention and cause us to take notice of something around us. They begin as chemical reactions and sensations that we must then translate into words to try to understand. But because they are processed in a different part of the brain from language and thinking, this translation is often slippery and inaccurate. (Greene, 2018)
	•	we do not have conscious access to the origins of our emotions and the moods they generate. Once we feel them, all we can do is try to interpret the emotion, translate it into language. But more often than not we get this wrong. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Emotions evolved for a different reason than cognition. These two forms of relating to the world are not connected seamlessly in our brains. For animals, unburdened by the need to translate physical sensations into abstract language, emotions function smoothly, as they were meant to. For us, the split between our emotions and our cognition is a source of constant internal friction, comprising a second Emotional Self within us that operates beyond our will. Animals feel fear for a brief time, then it is gone. We dwell on our fears, intensifying them and making them last well past the moment of danger, even to the point of feeling constant anxiety. (Greene, 2018)
	•	We constantly feel emotions, and they continually infect our thinking, making us veer toward thoughts that please us and soothe our egos. It is impossible to not have our inclinations and feelings somehow involved in what we think. Rational people are aware of this and through introspection and effort are able, to some extent, to subtract emotions from their thinking and counteract their effect. Irrational people have no such awareness. They rush into action without carefully considering the ramifications and consequences. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Emotions are continually affecting our thought processes and decisions, below the level of our awareness. (Greene, 2018)
	•	We cannot divorce emotions from thinking. The two are completely intertwined. But there is inevitably a dominant factor, some people more clearly governed by emotions than others. What we are looking for is the proper ratio and balance, the one that leads to the most effective action. (Greene, 2018)
	•	There is almost always an emotion behind any intention, and beyond their words, you are attuning yourself to what they want, their goals, which will also register physically in you if you pay attention. (Greene, 2018)
	•	We humans like to believe that the emotions we experience are simple and pure: we love certain people and hate others, we respect and admire this individual and have nothing but disdain for another. The truth is that this is almost never the case. It is a fundamental fact of human nature that our emotions are almost always ambivalent, rarely pure and simple. We can feel love and hostility at the same time, or admiration and envy. (Greene, 2018)
	•	This ambivalence began in our childhood and set the pattern for the rest of our lives. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Part of the reason for this essential ambivalence is that strong, pure emotions are frightening. They represent a momentary loss of control. They seem to negate our willpower. We unconsciously balance them with contrary or conflicting emotions. And part of it stems from the fact that our moods are continually shifting and overlapping. Whatever the cause, we are not aware of our own ambivalence because contemplating the complexity of our emotions is baffling, and we prefer to rely on simple explanations for who we are and what we are feeling. (Greene, 2018)
Low-grade emotions
	•	Low-grade emotions continually affect our thinking, and they originate from our own impulses—for instance, the desire for pleasing and comforting thoughts. (Greene, 2018)
High-grade emotion
	•	High-grade emotion, however, comes at certain moments, reaches an explosive pitch, and is generally sparked by something external—a person who gets under our skin, or particular circumstances. The level of arousal is higher and our attention is captured completely. The more we think about the emotion, the stronger it gets, which makes us focus even more on it, and so on and so forth. Our minds tunnel into the emotion, and everything reminds us of our anger or excitement. We become reactive. Because we are unable to bear the tension this brings, high-grade emotion usually culminates in some rash action with disastrous consequences. In the middle of such an attack we feel possessed, as if a second, limbic self has taken over. (Greene, 2018)
	•	It is best to be aware of these factors so that you can stop the mind from tunneling and prevent the releasing action that you will always come to regret. (Greene, 2018)
Emotional response
	•	the lack of emotional responses does not necessarily lead to poor decisions. (Loewenstein et al., 2001)
	•	Emotional reactions guide responses not only at their first occurrence, but also through conditioning and memory at later points in time, serving as somatic markers. (Loewenstein et al., 2001)
	•	In contrast to cognitive evaluations, emotional reactions are sensitive to the vividness of associated imagery, proximity in time, and a variety of other variables that play a minimal role in cognitive evaluations. (Loewenstein et al., 2001)
	•	although emotional reactions are also sensitive to probability and outcome valence, the functional relationships are quite different from those for cognitive evaluations. As a result of these differences, people often experience a discrepancy between the fear they experience in connection with a particular risk and their cognitive evaluation of the threat posed by that risk. (Loewenstein et al., 2001)
Emotional Self
	•	The Emotional Self thrives on ignorance. The moment you are aware of how it operates and dominates you is the moment it loses its hold on you and can be tamed. Therefore, your first step toward the rational is always inward. You want to catch that Emotional Self in action. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Being able to tame the Emotional Self leads to an overall calmness and clarity. In this state of mind you are less consumed by petty conflicts and considerations. Your actions are more effective, which also leads to less turmoil. You have the immense satisfaction of mastering yourself in a deep way. You have more mental space to be creative. You feel more in control. (Greene, 2018)
Emotional outburst
	•	A person suddenly loses his or her habitual self-control and sharply expresses deep resentments or says something biting and hurtful. In the aftermath of such a release, they may blame it on stress; they may say they did not mean any of it, when in fact the opposite is the case—the Shadow has spoken. Take what they said at face value. On a less intense level, people may suddenly become unusually sensitive and touchy. Some of their deepest fears and insecurities from childhood have somehow become activated, and this makes them hyperalert to any possible slight and ripe for smaller outbursts. (Greene, 2018)
Emotional turmoil
	•	Interactions with people are the major source of emotional turmoil, but it doesn’t have to be that way. The problem is that we are continually judging people, wishing they were something that they are not. We want to change them. We want them to think and act a certain way, most often the way we think and act. And because this is not possible, because everyone is different, we are continually frustrated and upset. (Greene, 2018)
Dispositional emotions
	•	dispositional emotions refer to the tendency to react with specific emotions across time and situations, momentary emotions refer to immediate affective reactions to a particular target (Gross, Sutton, & Ketelaar, 1998; Larsen & Ketelaar, 1991; Lazarus, 1994; Malatesta, 1990). (Lerner and Keltner, 2000)
Collective emotion
	•	When we are in a group of a large enough size, we become different. Notice yourself and others at a sporting event, a concert, a religious or political gathering. It is impossible to not feel yourself caught up in the collective emotions. Your heart beats faster. Tears of joy or sadness come more readily. Being in a group does not stimulate independent reasoning but rather the intense desire to belong. (Greene, 2018)
	•	This can happen equally in a work environment, particularly if the leader plays on people’s emotions to spur competitive, aggressive desires, or creates an us-versus-them dynamic. The group effect does not necessarily require the presence of others. It can occur virally, as some opinion spreads over social media and infects us with the desire to share the opinion—generally of a strong variety, such as outrage. (Greene, 2018)
	•	There is an exhilarating, positive aspect to the stimulation of group emotions. It is how we can be rallied to do something for the collective good. (Greene, 2018)
	•	It is often best to avoid the group setting if possible in order to maintain your reasoning powers, or to enter such moments with maximum skepticism. (Greene, 2018)

Communicating function of emotions
	•	The communicating function of emotions, a critical factor for social animals, also becomes somewhat tricky for us. We communicate anger when it is something else we are feeling, or about someone else, but the other person cannot see this and so they react as if personally attacked, which can create cascading misinterpretations. (Greene, 2018)
Incidental anger
	•	incidental anger increases tendencies to perceive other indivi- duals as responsible for subsequent events (Keltner, Ellsworth, & Edwards, 1993), and to make punitive judgements of other individuals, both related and unrelated to the original source of anger (Goldberg, Lerner, & Tetlock, 1999; Lerner, Goldberg, & Tetlock, 1998). (Lerner and Keltner, 2000)
Incidental sadness
	•	Incidental sadness, in contrast, increases the tendency to perceive situational factors (such as fate or circumstances) as responsible for ensuing events (Keltner et al., 1993). (Lerner and Keltner, 2000)
Productive emotions
	•	Productive emotions would include calmness. (Greene, 2018)
Fear
	•	people dispositionally prone to fear report experiencing more fear at a variety of points in time and across situations (Gross et al., 1998), they report higher levels of state fear in response to negative affect inductions (Gross et al., 1998), and they display more fear in the face (Keltner, 1996). (Lerner and Keltner, 2000)
	•	fear will be associated with the tendency to perceive uncertainty and situational control in new situations and that fearful people will – as a consequence of that appraisal tendency – perceive greater risk across new situations. (Lerner and Keltner, 2000)
	•	fear arises from appraisals of profound uncertainty. (Lerner and Keltner, 2000)
	•	Fear increases arousal and arousal increases the intensity of new fear responses (Lang, 1995). (Loewenstein et al., 2001)
	•	certain types of fears also exhibit resistance to extinction. (Loewenstein et al., 2001)
	•	Fear typically peaks just before a threat is experienced and is highly dependent on mental imagery (and thus subject to vividness effects). (Loewenstein et al., 2001)
	•	Animals feel fear for a brief time, then it is gone. We dwell on our fears, intensifying them and making them last well past the moment of danger, even to the point of feeling constant anxiety. (Greene, 2018)
Fear responses
	•	Fear responses also seem to be conditioned, in part, by our evolutionary makeup; we may be prepared to learn very rapidly about some types of risks but much more slowly about others. Fear responses are evoked, often by crude or subliminal cues. (Loewenstein et al., 2001)
Fear conditioning
	•	Fear conditioning may be permanent, or at least far longer lasting than other kinds of learning. (Loewenstein et al., 2001)
Free-floating fear
	•	The great interest that popular culture takes in fictional violent crime and that journalists take in real violent crimes contributes to a general perception that violent crimes are more frequent than they really are. Survey respondents often report high levels of fear but are imprecise about the threats, although they blame crime in general, the surrounding area in general, or certain demographics, and the refer to a recent crime as evidence of increasing frequency. This but abstract fear has been termed free-floating fear.
	•	Such fear is very frustrating for police and public safety professionals when they succed in lowering crime without lowering the public’s fear of crime (although sometimes such professionals are less willing to admit that minor crimes and social disorder often increase even while the rates of serious crime or overall crime decrease). (Newsome, 2013)
Anger
	•	anger arises from appraisals of individual control of negative events. (Lerner and Keltner, 2000)
	•	Anger, by contrast, will be associated with the tendency to perceive certainty and individual control in new situations and – as a consequence – to perceive less risk across new situations. (Lerner and Keltner, 2000)
	•	anger arises from appraisals of certainty and individual control. (Lerner and Keltner, 2000)
	•	characterised by attributions of personal control. (Lerner and Keltner, 2000)
Envy
	•	But envy is not a feeling that we are ever comfortable with, and so often we translate it as something more palatable—anger, dislike, resentment. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Take notice of people who praise or flatter you without their eyes lighting up. This could be a sign of hidden envy. (Greene, 2018)
	•	If you suspect someone of feeling envy, talk about the latest good news for you without appearing to brag. Look for microexpressions of disappointment on their face. Use similar tests to probe for hidden anger and resentments, eliciting the responses that people cannot suppress so quickly. In general, people will want to see more of you, want to see less of you, or be rather indifferent. They may fluctuate among the three states, but they will tend to veer toward one. They will reveal this in how quickly they respond to your emails or texts, their body language on first seeing you, and the overall tone they take in your presence. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Nobody admits to acting out of envy. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Inevitably, along with the attraction to Mary came envy—the desire to have the same things as Mary, the sense of being entitled to have them, but the apparent inability to get them easily or legitimately. With envy comes the secret desire to hurt, wound, or steal from the envied person, to right the unfairness that comes with his or her supposed superiority. (Greene, 2018)
	•	it is socially toxic to display envy. It reveals deep insecurity along with hostility, a very ugly brew, which is certain to push people away. (Greene, 2018)
	•	envy is a painful emotion, an admission of our own inferiority, something rather unbearable for us humans. It is not an emotion we want to sit with and brood over. We like to conceal it from ourselves and not be aware that it motivates our actions. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Envy occurs most commonly and painfully among friends. We assume that something in the course of the relationship caused the friend to turn against us. Sometimes all we experience is the betrayal, the sabotage, the ugly criticisms they throw at us, and we never understand the underlying envy that inspired these actions. (Greene, 2018)
	•	What we need to grasp is something paradoxical: people who feel envy in the first place are often motivated to become our friends. Like Jane, they feel a mix of genuine interest, attraction, and envy, if we have some qualities that make them feel inferior. Becoming our friend, they can disguise the envy to themselves. They will often go even further, becoming extra attentive and impatient to secure our friendship. But as they draw closer, the problem gets worse. The underlying envy is continually stirred. The very traits that might have stimulated feelings of inferiority—the good position, the solid work ethic, the likability—are now being witnessed on a daily basis. (Greene, 2018)
	•	narrative is gradually constructed: the envied person is lucky, overly ambitious, not nearly so great. As our friends, enviers can discover our weak points and what will wound the most. From within a friendship they are better positioned to sabotage us, steal our spouse, spread mayhem. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Of all the human emotions, none is trickier or more elusive than envy. It is very difficult to actually discern the envy that motivates people’s actions or to even know that we have suffered an envy attack from another. This is what makes it so frustrating to deal with and so dangerous. (Greene, 2018)
	•	The reason for this elusiveness is simple: we almost never directly express the envy we are feeling. (Greene, 2018)
	•	All of us feel envy, the sensation that others have more of what we want—possessions, attention, respect. We deserve to have as much as they do yet feel somewhat helpless to get such things. (Greene, 2018)
	•	envy entails the admission to ourselves that we are inferior to another person in something we value. Not only is it painful to admit this inferiority, but it is even worse for others to see that we are feeling this. (Greene, 2018)
	•	almost as soon as we feel the initial pangs of envy, we are motivated to disguise it to ourselves—it is not envy we feel but unfairness at the distribution of goods or attention, resentment at this unfairness, even anger. Furthermore, the other person is not really superior but simply lucky, overly ambitious, or unscrupulous. That’s how they got to where they are. Having convinced ourselves that envy is not motivating us but something else, we also make it very difficult for others to detect the underlying envy. They see only our anger, indignation, hostile criticisms, poisonous praise, and so on. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Today, however, people are much more political and indirect, able to control any overt aggressive impulses and disguise what they’re feeling. Instead of violence, enviers are likely to sabotage our work, ruin a relationship, sully our reputation, torment us with criticisms that are aimed at our most basic insecurities. This allows them to maintain their social position while causing harm, their targets not even suspecting envy as the motivation. They can justify these actions to themselves as righting the perceived imbalance or unfairness. (Greene, 2018)
	•	it is important to distinguish between passive and active envy. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Your goal is to detect the signs of this more acute form of envy before it turns dangerous. You can do this in three ways: by learning the signs of envy that manage to leak through, by being aware of the types of people who are more prone to acting on envy, and by understanding the circumstances and actions that might trigger active envy in people. You can never see all of the actions motivated by envy; people are simply too good at disguising it. But using all three decoding devices will increase your chances of detection. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Although the signs are subtle, envious feelings tend to leak out and can be detected if you are observant. (Greene, 2018)
	•	When people first experience envy, they have not yet fooled themselves into thinking it is something else, and so they are more prone to leakage than later on. That is why first impressions are often the most accurate and should be given added weight in this case. Envy is most associated with the eyes. The root of the Latin word for envy, invidia, means “to look through, to probe with the eyes like a dagger.” The early meaning of the word was associated with the “evil eye” and the belief that a look could actually convey a curse and physically harm someone. (Greene, 2018)
	•	The eyes are indeed a telling indicator, but the envious microexpression affects the entire face. You will notice the envier’s eyes momentarily boring into you, with a look that suggests disdain and a touch of hostility. It is the look of a child who feels cheated. With this look the corners of the mouth will often be turned down, the nose in a sneering, somewhat upturned position, the chin jutting out. Although the look will be a little too direct and held a little too long, it still will not last more than a second or two. It is usually followed with a strained, fake smile. Often you will see the look by accident, as you suddenly turn your head their direction, or you will feel their eyes burning into you without directly looking at them. (Greene, 2018)
	•	ell suspected enviers some good news about yourself—a promotion, a new and exciting love interest, a book contract. You will notice a very quick expression of disappointment. Their tone of voice as they congratulate you will betray some tension and strain. Equally, tell them some misfortune of yours and notice the uncontrollable microexpression of joy in your pain, what is commonly known as schadenfreude. Their eyes light up for a fleeting second. People who are envious cannot help feeling some glee when they hear of the bad luck of those they envy. (Greene, 2018)
	•	These comments will also come at moments chosen tocause maximum doubt and damage, for instance just when you have heard the good news and feel a flush of joy. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Similarly, in noting your success, they may bring up the least likable parts of your audience, the kinds of fans or consumers who do not reflect well on you. “Well, I’m sure Wall Street executives are going to love this.” This is thrown in among other normal comments, but the guilt by association lingers in your mind. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Poisonous praise almost always indicates envy. They feel the need to praise, but what dominates is the underlying hostility. If they have a habit of praising in this way, if you experience it several times, it is probably an indication of something more intense stirring within them. (Greene, 2018)
	•	If people like to gossip a lot, particularly about common acquaintances, you can be sure they will gossip about you. And gossip is a frequent cover for envy, a convenient way to vent it by sharing malicious rumors and stories. When they talk about others behind their backs, you will see their eyes light up and their voice become animated—it gives them a joy comparable to schadenfreude. They will elicit any kind of negative report about a common acquaintance. A frequent theme in their gossip is that no one’s really that great, and people aren’t what they pretend to be. (Greene, 2018)
	•	criticism of you that seems sincere but not directly related to anything you have actually done is usually a strong sign of envy. People want to bully and overwhelm you with something negative, both wounding you and covering any tracks of envy. (Greene, 2018)
	•	According to the psychoanalyst Melanie Klein (1882–1960), certain people are prone to feeling envy their entire lives, and this begins in early infancy. (Greene, 2018)
	•	All potentially positive experiences are spoiled by the sensation that they should have more and better. Something is missing, and they can only imagine that other people are cheating them out of what they should have. They develop an eagle eye for what others have that they don’t. This becomes their dominant passion. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Because envy is a painful sensation, these types will enact lifelong strategies to mitigate or repress these feelings that gnaw at them. They will denigrate anything or anyone good in the world. This means there aren’t really people out there worth envying. Or they will become extremely independent. (Greene, 2018)
	•	The envy they experienced in their earliest years remains continually latent and ready to be directed at others. They are literally looking for people to envy so they can reexperience the primal emotion. (Greene, 2018)
	•	not many people discuss or analyze envy as a major social factor. But the truth is that envy is more prevalent now than ever before, largely because of social media. (Greene, 2018)
	•	What this means is simple: we will find more and more people around us prone to feeling passive envy that can turn into the virulent form if we are not careful. We must be prepared to feel its effects coming from friends, colleagues, and the public if we are in the public eye. In such an overheated social environment, learning to recognize the signs and being able to identify envier types is an absolutely critical skill to develop. And since we are now all more susceptible to feeling envy ourselves, we must also learn how to manage this emotion within ourselves, transforming it into something positive and productive. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Like most humans, you will tend to deny that you ever experience envy, at least strong enough to act on. You are simply not being honest with yourself. As described above, you are only conscious of the indignation or resentment you feel that covers up the initial pangs of envy. You need to overcome the natural resistance to seeing the emotion as it first stirs within you. (Greene, 2018)
	•	You can begin with a simple experiment: next time you hear or read about the sudden success of someone in your field, notice the inevitable feeling of wanting the same (the pang) and the subsequent hostility, however vague, toward the person you envy. It happens quickly and you can easily miss thetransition, but try to catch it. It is natural to go through this emotional sequence and there should be no guilt attached. Monitoring yourself and seeing more such instances will only help you in the slow process of moving beyond envy. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Let us be realistic, however, and realize that it is almost impossible to rid ourselves of the compulsion to compare ourselves with others. It is too ingrained in our nature as a social animal. Instead, what we must aspire to is to slowly transform our comparing inclination into something positive, productive, and prosocial. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Envy thrives on relative closeness—in a corporate environment where people see each other every day, in a family, in a neighborhood, in any group of peers. But people tend to hide their problems and to put their best face forward. We only see and hear of their triumphs, their new relationships, their brilliant ideas that will land them a gold mine. If we moved closer—if we saw the quarrels that go on behind closed doors or the horrible boss that goes with that new job—we would have less reason to feel envy. Nothing is ever so perfect as it seems, and often we would see that we are mistaken if we only looked closely enough. (Greene, 2018)
	•	If you envy people with greater fame and attention, remind yourself that with such attention comes a lot of hostility and scrutiny that is quite painful. (Greene, 2018)
	•	When we envy someone, we are prone to feel excitement, even joy, if they experience a setback or suffer in some way. (Greene, 2018)
	•	having a sense of purpose, a feel for your calling in life, is a great way to immunize yourself against envy. You are focused on your own life and plans, which are clear and invigorating. What gives you satisfaction is realizing your potential, not earning attention from the public, which is fleeting. You have much less need to compare. Your sense of self-worth comes from within, not from without. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Admiration is the polar opposite of envy. (Greene, 2018)
Active envy
	•	Sometimes, however, this passive envy turns active. The underlying sense of inferiority is too strong, leading to hostility that cannot be vented by a comment or put-down. Sitting with one’s envy over a long period of time can be painful and frustrating. Feeling righteous indignation against the envied person, however, can be invigorating. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Acting on envy, doing something to harm the other person, brings satisfaction, as it did to Jane, although the satisfaction is short-lived because enviers always find something new to envy. (Greene, 2018)
Deep envy
	•	feelings of inferiority and frustration that lead to covert attacks and sabotage. (Greene, 2018)
	•	A major envy attack is often preceded by little envy bites—offhand comments expertly designed to get under your skin. Confusing, paradoxical praise is a common form of this. (Greene, 2018)
Passive envy
	•	All of us in the course of a day will inevitably feel some pangs of envy, as we unconsciously monitor the people around us and sense that they might have more. It is a fact of social life that there are always people who are superior to us in wealth, intelligence, likability, and other qualities. If these pangs rise to the level of consciousness and are a bit acute, we might say something hurtful or mean-spirited as a way to vent the emotion. But generally as we experience this passive form of envy, we do not do anything that would in any meaningful way harm the relationship with a friend or colleague. (Greene, 2018)
	•	In detecting signs of passive envy in others (for instance, little put-downs and offhand comments), you should simply tolerate this as a fact of being a social animal. (Greene, 2018)
Envy attack
	•	If you find yourself under an envy attack, your best strategy is to control your emotions. It is much easier to do this once you realize that envy is the source. (Greene, 2018)
Envyer
	•	The envier feeds upon your overreaction as material to criticize you, justify their actions, and entangle you in some further drama. At all costs, maintain your composure. If possible, get some physical distance as well—fire them, cut off contact, whatever is possible. Do not imagine you can somehow repair the relationship. Your generosity in trying this will only intensify their feelings of inferiority. They will strike again. By all means defend yourself from any public attacks or gossip that they spread, but do not harbor revenge fantasies. The envier is miserable. The best strategy is let to them stew in their “cold poison” from a distance, without any future means of wounding you, as Mary did to Jane. Their chronic unhappiness is punishment enough. (Greene, 2018)
Envy triggers
	•	Although certain types are more prone to envy, you must also be aware that there are circumstances that will tend to trigger envy in almost anyone. You must be extra alert in such situations. (Greene, 2018)
Envying types
	•	These types have a trait that is quite common to all enviers: they lack a clear sense of purpose in their life. (Greene, 2018)
	•	The most common trigger is a sudden change in your status, which alters your relationship to friends and peers. This is particularly true among people in your own profession. (Greene, 2018)
	•	If you experience success, those in your field who have similar aspirations but who are still struggling will naturally feel envious. You should be reasonably tolerant of this because if the tables were reversed, you would probably feel the same. Do not take so personally their faint praise and veiled criticisms. But be aware that among some of these peers envy can turn active and dangerous. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Keep in mind that people who are getting older, with their careers on the decline, have delicate egos and are quite prone to experiencing envy. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Sometimes it is people’s natural gifts and talents that will stir up the most intense forms of envy. We can strive to become proficient in a field, but we cannot reengineer our physiology. Some people are born with better looks, more raw athletic skill, an unusually vivid imagination, or an open and generous nature. If people with natural gifts also possess a good work ethic and have some luck in life, envy will follow them wherever they go. Often making it worse for such types, they also tend to be quite naive. They themselves do not feel envy toward others, so they cannot understand the emotion at all. Unaware of the dangers, they naturally display their talents and attract even more envy. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Women who achieve success and fame are more prone to attracting envy and hostility, although this will always be veiled as something else —such women are said to be too cold, or ambitious, or unfeminine. Oftentimes we choose to admire people who achieve great things, admiration being the opposite of envy. (Greene, 2018)
Attacher
	•	In any court-like environment of power, you will inevitably find people who are drawn to those who are successful or powerful, not out of admiration but out of secret envy. They find a way to attach themselves as friends or assistants. They make themselves useful. They may admire their boss for some qualities, but deep down they believe they are entitled to have some of the attention he or she is getting, without all the hard work. The longer they are around the high achiever, the more this feeling gnaws at them. They have talent, they have dreams—why should the person they work for be so favored? They are good at concealing the undercurrent of envy through excessive fawning. But these types attach themselves because it gives them some kind of satisfaction to spoil and wound the person who has more. They are drawn to the powerful out of a desire to harm them in some way. (Greene, 2018)
	•	These types have a trait that is quite common to all enviers: they lack a clear sense of purpose in their life (see chapter 13 for more on this). They do not know their calling; they could do many things, they think, and often try different jobs. They wander around and feel empty inside. They naturally envy those who act with a sense of purpose, and will go so far as to attach themselves to such a person’s life, partly wishing to get some of what they themselves are missing and partly desiring to harm the other person. (Greene, 2018)
	•	be wary of those who are too eager to attach themselves to your life, too impatient to make themselves useful. They try to draw you into a relationship not by their experience and competence but by the flattery and attention they give you. Their form of attack is to gather information on you that they can leak out or spread as gossip, harming your reputation. Learn to hire and work with those who have experience rather than just a pleasing manner. We do not feel personally challenged or insecure in the face of their excellence. We might alsoemulate them, use them as spurs toward trying to achieve more. But unfortunately this is rarely the case with successful women. A high-achieving woman inflicts greater feelings of inferiority in both other women and men (“I’m inferior to a woman?”), which leads to envy and hostility, not admiration. (Greene, 2018)
Insecure Master
	•	For some people, reaching a high position validates their self-opinion and boosts their self-esteem. But there are some who are more anxious. Holding a high position tends to increase their insecurities, which they are careful to conceal. Secretly they doubt whether they are worthy of the responsibility. They look at others who might have more talent, even those below them, with an envious eye. (Greene, 2018)
	•	ay attention to those above you for signs of insecurity and envy. They will inevitably have a track record of firing people for strange reasons. They will not seem particularly happy with that excellent report you turned in. Always play it safe by deferring to bosses, making them look better, and earning their trust. Couch your brilliant ideas astheir ideas. Let them get all the credit for your hard work. Your time to shine will come, but not if you inadvertently stimulate their insecurities. (Greene, 2018)
Levelers
	•	When you first meet them, levelers can seem rather entertaining and interesting. They tend to have a wicked sense of humor. They are good at putting down those who are powerful and deflating the pretentious. They also seem to have a keen nose for injustice and unfairness in this world. But where they differ from people with genuine empathy for underdogs is that levelers cannot recognize or appreciate excellence in almost anyone, except those who are dead. They have fragile egos. Those who have achieved things in life make them feel insecure. They are highly sensitive to feelings of inferiority. The envy they initially feel for those who are successful is quickly covered up by indignation. They rail at high achievers for gaming the system, for being far too ambitious, or simply for being lucky and not really deserving praise. They have come to associate excellence with unfairness, as a way to soothe their insecurities. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Besides their cynical humor, you can recognize this type by how they talk about their own life: they love to tell stories of the many injustices inflicted on them; they are always blameless. These types make excellent professional critics—they can use this medium to tear down those they secretly envy and be rewarded for it. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Their main goal is to bring everyone down to the same mediocre level they occupy. This sometimes means leveling not only achievers and the powerful but also those who are having too good a time, who seem to be enjoying themselves too much, or who have too great a sense of purpose, which levelers lack. (Greene, 2018)
	•	hey will begin with passive-aggressive comments that taint you with the ugly word “ambition.” You might be a part of the oppressor class. They will criticize you in ugly and hurtful ways. They may follow this up with active sabotage of your work, which they justify to themselves as a form of retributive justice. (Greene, 2018)
Self-entitled Slacker
	•	Some people, however, feel they deserve attention and many rewards in life as if these are naturally due to them. These self-entitled slackers are generally quite narcissistic. They will make the briefest outline for a novel or screenplay they want to write, or an “idea” for a brilliant business, and feel that that is enough to attract praise and attention. But deep down, these slackers feel insecure about their ability to get what they want; that is why they have never really developed the proper discipline. When they find themselves around high achievers who work very hard and have earned true respect for their work, this will make them aware of the doubts about themselves they have been trying to repress. They will move quickly from envy to hostility. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Be extra careful in the work environment with those who like to maintain their position through charm and being political, rather than by getting things done. They are very prone to envying and hatingthose who work hard and get results. They will slander and sabotage you without any warning. (Greene, 2018)
Status fiend
	•	As social animals we humans are very sensitive to our rank and position within any group. We can measure our status by the attention and respect we receive. We are constantly monitoring differences and comparing ourselves with others. But for some people status is more than a way of measuring social position—it is the most important determinant of their self-worth. You will notice such fiends by the questions they ask about how much money you make, whether you own your home, what kind of neighborhood it’s in, whether you occasionally fly business class, and all of the other petty things that they can use as points of comparison. If you are of a higher social status than they are, they will conceal their envy by appearing to admire your success. But if you are a peer or happen to work with them, they will be sniffing for any sign of favoritism or privileges they don’t have, and they will attack you in underhanded ways, undermining your position within the group. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Recognize status fiends by how they reduce everything to material considerations. When they comment on the clothes you wear or the car you drive, they seem to focus on the money these things must have cost, and as they talk about such things, you will notice something childish in their demeanor, as if they were reliving a family drama in which they felt cheated by a sibling who had something better. (Greene, 2018)
Low-grade envy
	•	What we experience in this case is a generalized feeling of dissatisfaction. Low-grade envy sits inside us, waiting to be triggered into the more acute variety if something we read or see intensifies our insecurities. Such diffuse envy among large groups of people can even become a political force, as demagogues can stir it against certain individuals or groups of people who have or seem to have it easier than others. People can be unified through their underlying envy, but as with the personal variety, nobody will admit to this, nor will it ever be seen as such. (Greene, 2018)
Public envy
	•	Public envy can be quickly turned against public figures, especially in the form of schadenfreude when they experience some misfortune. (Witness the piling on of hostility toward Martha Stewart once she seemed to run afoul of the law.) Gossip about the powerful becomes an industry. (Greene, 2018)
Sadness
	•	sadness arises from appraisals of situational control of negative events. (Lerner and Keltner, 2000)
	•	characterised by attributions of situational control. (Lerner and Keltner, 2000)
Desire
	•	characterised by devout attention to a person or object. (Lerner and Keltner, 2000)
Disgust
	•	characterised by strong unwillingness to attend to a person or object. (Lerner and Keltner, 2000)
Anticipatory emotions
	•	Anticipatory emotions are immediate visceral reactions (e.g., fear, anxiety, dread) to risks and uncertainties. (Loewenstein et al., 2001)
	•	consistent with the notion that anticipatory emotions play a critical role in risk aversion and farsighted decision making, several populations who do not feel or fear the future in the same way that others do make decisions that display a profound disregard for future consequence. (Loewenstein et al., 2001)
Anticipated emotions
	•	Anticipated emotions are typically not experienced in the immediate present but are expected to be experienced in the future. (Loewenstein et al., 2001)
Emotional state
	•	Our emotional state is largely determined by what we attend to, and we are normally focused on our current activity and immediate environment. There are exceptions, where the quality of subjective experience is dominated by recurrent thoughts rather than by the events of the moment. (Kahneman, 2012)
Positive emotion
	•	people who feel positive emotions for you will display noticeable signs of relaxation in the facial muscles, particularly in the lines of the forehead and the area around the mouth; their lips will appear more fully exposed and the whole area around their eyes will widen. These are all involuntary expressions of comfort and openness. If the feelings are more intense, such as falling in love, blood rushes to the face, animating all of the features. As part of this excited state the pupils will dilate, an automatic response in which the eyes let in more light. It is a sure sign that a person is comfortable and likes what they are seeing. Along with the dilation the eyebrows will rise, making the eyes look even bigger. We do not usually pay attention to eye pupils because looking intently into another’s eyes has an overtly sexual connotation. (Greene, 2018)
Negative emotion
	•	In trying to hide our negative feelings, we most often resort to the fake smile, because it is easy and people generally do not pay attention to the subtleties of smiles. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Negative emotions have a binding power—a person who is angry is more prone to also feel suspicion, deep insecurities, resentment, et cetera. And so we often find combinations of these various negative attitudes, each one feeding and accentuating the other. (Greene, 2018)
Empathy
	•	Empathy plays an enormous role in learning and knowledge. (Greene, 2014)
	•	We all naturally possess the most remarkable tool for connecting to people and attaining social power—empathy. (Greene, 2018)
	•	When cultivated and properly used, it can allow us to see into the moods and minds of others, giving us the power to anticipate people’s actions and gently lower their resistance. (Greene, 2018)
	•	This instrument, however, is blunted by our habitual Self-absorption. We are all narcissists, some deeper on the spectrum than others. Our mission in life is to come to terms with this Self-love and learn how to turn our sensitivity outward, toward others, instead of inward. (Greene, 2018)
	•	The other direction healthy narcissists take is toward people, developing empathic powers. Imagine empathy as the realm lying at the very top of the scale and beyond—complete absorption in others. By our very nature, we humans have tremendous abilities to understand people from the inside out. In our earliest years, we felt completely bonded with our mother, and we could sense her every mood and read her every emotion in a preverbal way. Unlike any other animal or primate, we also had the ability to extend this beyond the mother to other caregivers and people in our vicinity. This is the physical form of empathy that we feel even to this day with our closest friends, spouses, or partners. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Those who practice this empathy often become superior social observers in the arts or sciences, therapists, and leaders of the highest order. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Like any skill, empathy comes through the quality of attention. (Greene, 2018)
	•	The need to develop this empathy is greater than ever. Various studies have indicated a gradual increase in levels of Self-absorption and narcissism in young people since the late 1970s, with a much higher spike since 2000. Much of this can be attributed to technology and the internet. People simply spend less time in social interactions and more time socializing online, which makes it increasingly difficult to develop empathy and sharpen social skills. Like any skill, empathy comes through the quality of attention. If your attention is continually interrupted by the need to look at your smartphone, you are never really gaining a foothold in the feelings or perspectives of other people. You are continually drawn back to yourself, flitting about the surface of social interactions, never really engaging. Even in a crowd, you remain essentially alone. People come to serve a function—not to bond with but to placate your insecurities. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Deep narcissism tends to sink you deeper, as your connection to reality lessens and you are unable to really develop your work or your relationships. Empathy does the opposite. As you increasingly turn your attention outward, you get constant positive feedback. People want to be around you more. You develop your empathic muscle; your work improves; without trying, you gain the attention that all humans thrive on. Empathy creates its own upward, positive momentum. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Empathy is more than anything a state of mind, a different way of relating to others. The greatest danger you face is your general assumption that you really understand people and that you can quickly judge and categorize them. Instead, you must begin with the assumption that you are ignorant and that you have natural biases that will make you judge people incorrectly. The people around you present a mask that suits their purposes. You mistake the mask for reality. (Greene, 2018)
	•	This flexible, open spirit is similar to creative energy—a willingness to consider more possibilities and options. In fact, developing your empathy will also improve your creative powers. (Greene, 2018)
	•	As part of this attitude, you are giving people the same level of indulgence that you give yourself. For instance, we all have a tendency to do the following: When we make a mistake, we attribute it to circumstances that pushed us into doing it. But when others make a mistake, we tend to see it as a character flaw, as something that flowed from their imperfect personality. This is known as the attribution bias. You must work against this. With an empathic attitude, you consider first the circumstances that might have made a person do what they did, giving them the same benefit of the doubt as you give yourself. (Greene, 2018)
	•	adopting this attitude depends on the quality of your Self-love. If you feel terribly superior to others, or gripped by insecurities, your moments of empathy and absorption in people will be shallow. What you need is a complete acceptance of your character, including your flaws, which you can see clearly but even appreciate and love. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Empathy is an instrument of emotional attunement. It is hard for us to read or figure out the thoughts of another person, but feelings and moods are much easier for us to pick up. We are all prone to catching the emotions of another person. The physical boundaries between us and other people are much more permeable than we realize. (Greene, 2018)
	•	This kind of empathy depends largely on mirror neurons—those neurons that fire in our brain when we watch someone do something, such as picking up an object, just as if we were doing it ourselves. This allows us to put ourselves in the shoes of others and to feel what it must be like. (Greene, 2018)
	•	mirroring people on any level will draw out an empathic response from them. This can be physical, and is known as the chameleon effect. People who are connecting physically and emotionally in a conversation will tend to mimic each other’s gestures and posture, both crossing their legs, for instance. To a degree, you can do this consciously to induce a connection by deliberately mimicking someone. Similarly, nodding your head as they talk and smiling will deepen the connection. Even better, you can enter the spirit of the other person. You absorb their mood deeply and reflect it back to them. You create a feeling of rapport. People secretly crave this emotional rapport in their daily lives, because they get it so rarely. It has a hypnotic effect and appeals to people’s narcissism as you become their mirror. In practicing this type of empathy, keep in mind that you must maintain a degree of distance. You are not becoming completely enmeshed in the emotions of another. This will make it hard for you to analyze what you are picking up and can lead to a loss of control that is not healthy. Also, doing this too strongly and obviously can create a creepy effect. The nodding, smiling, and mirroring at selected moments should be subtle, almost impossible to detect. (Greene, 2018)
	•	The reason you are able to understand your friends or partner so deeply is that you have a lot of information about their tastes, values, and family background. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Such use of empathy has the opposite effect of mutual narcissism. Coming from one side, it tends to soften the other one up and invite his or her empathy as well. It is hard to stay in one’s defensive position when the other person is seeing and expressing your side and entering your spirit. It beckons you to do the same. Secretly people yearn to let go of their resistance. It is exhausting to continually be so defensive and suspicious. (Greene, 2018)
	•	The key to employing empathy within a relationship is to understand the value system of the other person, which inevitably is different from yours. What they interpret as signs of love or attention or generosity tends to diverge from your way of thinking. These value systems are largely formed in early childhood and are not consciously created by people. Keeping in mind their value system will allow you to enter their spirit and perspective precisely in the moment you would normally turn defensive. (Greene, 2018)
	•	the emphatic trait generally rests on top of the opposite trait, distracting and concealing it from public view. (Greene, 2018)
Physical empathy
	•	The reason you are able to understand your friends or partner so deeply is that you have a lot of information about their tastes, values, and family background. (Greene, 2018)
	•	So while physical empathy is extremely powerful, it must be supplemented by analytic empathy. This can prove particularly helpful with people toward whom we feel resistant and whom we have a hard time identifying with—either because they are very different from us or because there is something about them that repels us. In such cases we naturally resort to judging and putting them into categories. (Greene, 2018)
Analytic empathy
	•	So while physical empathy is extremely powerful, it must be supplemented by analytic empathy. This can prove particularly helpful with people toward whom we feel resistant and whom we have a hard time identifying with—either because they are very different from us or because there is something about them that repels us. In such cases we naturally resort to judging and putting them into categories. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Analytic empathy comes mostly through conversation and gathering information that will allow you to get inside the spirit of others. (Greene, 2018)
Empathic skills
	•	Becoming empathetic involves a process, like anything. In order to make sure that you are really making progress and improving your ability to understand people on a deeper level, you need feedback. This can be done in two forms: direct and indirect (Greene, 2018)
	•	The more people you interact with in the flesh, the better you will get at this. And the greater the variety of people you meet, the more versatile your skill will become. (Greene, 2018)
	•	keep a sense of flow. Your ideas about people never quite settle into a judgment. In an encounter, keep your attention active to see how the other person changes over the course of a conversation and the effect you are having on them. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Be alive to the moment. Try to see people as they interact with others besides you—people are often very different depending on the person they are involved with. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Try to focus not on categories but on the feeling tone and mood that people evoke in you, which is continually shifting. (Greene, 2018)
	•	As you get better at this, you will discover more and more cues that people give as to their psychology. You will notice more. Continually mix the visceral with the analytic. (Greene, 2018)
Direct form
	•	In the direct form, you ask people about their thoughts and feelings to get a sense of whether you have guessed correctly. This must be discreet and based on a level of trust, but it can be a very accurate gauge of your skill. ﻿(Greene, 2018)
Indirect form
	•	Then there is the indirect form—you sense a greater rapport and how certain techniques have worked for you. (Greene, 2018)
Empathic powers
	•	What makes us develop these empathic powers is necessity. If we feel our survival depends on how well we gauge the moods and minds of others, then we will find the requisite focus and tap into the powers. Normally we do not feel the need for this. We imagine that we understand quite well the people we deal with. Life can be harsh and we have too many other tasks to attend to. We are lazy and prefer to rely upon predigested judgments. But in fact it is a matter of life and death and our success does depend on the development of these skills. We simply are not aware of this because we do not see the connection between problems in our lives and our constant misreading of people’s moods and intentions and the endless missed opportunities that accrue from this. (Greene, 2018)
Empirical
	•	The term ‘empirical’ is usually applied to practical primary research that is conducted in the ‘field’. It is often used to refer to work resting on trial or experiment. (Davies et al., 2002)
Empirical approach
	•	The empirical approach implicitly involved an intuitive societal balancing of such values. (Starr, 1969)
Enemies
	•	the nation’s main foreign adversaries, actual and potential. (Betts, 2007)
	•	As mentioned above, our ancestors had a reflexive fear at the sight of any outsiders to their group. This fear easily slid into hatred. The basis for this fear may well have been real, but the existence of rival tribes also had a positive side effect—it united and tightened the group. It also fit in well with the way the human brain processes information, through binary pairs of opposites—light and dark, good and evil, us versus them. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Today, in our modern sophisticated world, you will notice this very ancient dynamic continually at play: any group will reflexively focus on some hated enemy, real or imagined, to help bring the tribe together. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Since time immemorial, leaders have exploited this enemy reflex for power, using the existence of the rival or enemy to justify almost anything and to distract from their own shortcomings. The enemy will be described as “amoral,” “irrational,” “untrustworthy,” or “aggressive,” the implication being that “our” group is the opposite. No side ever likes to admit it is not pure in its ethics, or has aggressive intentions, or is governed by emotion—it is always the other side. In the end, the need to feel a part of the tribe and against the other side is more important than the actual differences, which tend to be greatly exaggerated. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Tribalism has its roots in the deepest and most primitive parts of our nature, but it is now coupled with much greater technological prowess, which makes it all the more dangerous. What allowed us thousands of years ago to bind our group tightly and survive could now easily lead to our extinction as a species. The tribe feels its very existence at stake by the presence of the enemy. There is little middle ground. Battles can be more intense and violent between tribes. (Greene, 2018)
Outside enemies
	•	These are governments or groups in conflict with the United States who want to conceal or misrepresent their intentions, capabilities, or vulnerabilities. (Betts, 2007)
	•	To defeat outside enemies the main solution is to invest in more and better ways to penetrate their secrecy, unmask disinformation, and protect U.S. assets through counterintelligence efforts. For the innocent enemies the main solutions are to fire the dullards and slackers, if stupidity or dereliction are to blame, and replace them with staff that are smarter, more careful, more creative, and harder working; to rationalize the structure and process by improving wiring diagrams and behavioral guidelines, if bad organization and standard operating procedures are the problem; or to repeal or modify the regulations if interference from legal and political constraints is unjustified. (Betts, 2007)
Innocent enemies
	•	they threaten intelligence unintentionally. (Betts, 2007)
	•	the myopic and turf-conscious leadership of intelligence organizations who allow inefficient procedures to block the integration, dissemination, and use of available information; and the politicians or lawyers who deliberately try to constrain intelligence operations that conflict with other values, such as the constitutional rights of citizens. (Betts, 2007)

Good enemies 
	•	they are simply protecting public interests more important than strategic intelligence. (Betts, 2007)
Inherent enemies
	•	grow out of the human condition and the dynamics of the intelligence function itself. They are an amorphous and impersonal group of dysfunctions that, if not quite intractable, are close to it. Solutions for beating inherent enemies are nonlinear and elusive. (Betts, 2007)
	•	These enemies are a collection of mental limitations, dilemmas, contradictory imperatives, paradoxical interactions, and trade-offs among objectives in the intelligence process itself that often block proper assessment and judgment and make it difficult to fix one source of failure without creating another. (Betts, 2007)
	•	These include defects in organizational design that cannot be changed without risking equally bad results in some other dimension of the process. (Betts, 2007)
	•	Inherent enemies pervade the process no matter who is involved, and they intrude time and again. Although not immune to defeat, they are extraordinarily resistant. (Betts, 2007)
	•	Among the inherent enemies are the physical limitations of cognitive processes. Simply because of the physiology of perception and memory, the human brain even at its best apprehends information in ways that are limited and distorted to an extent utterly unappreciated by most officials and critics. (Betts, 2007)
	•	These enemies are the contradictions and trade-offs inherent in dealing with uncertainty and complexity, and in working at the nexus of empirical assessment and political decision. (Betts, 2007)
	•	In contrast to the prosecutor’s view that goes naturally with a focus on outside or innocent enemies, focusing on inherent enemies produces a tragic view of intelligence failure. (Betts, 2007)
	•	Inherent enemies reside in the nature of human physiology and consciousness, organizational routine, and the complexity of modern government. (Betts, 2007)
Unknown enemies
	•	les ennemis qu'on connaît ne sont point, vous le savez, les plus dangereux. (Dumas, 1998)
Engineering psychology
	•	Engineering psychology generally focuses on the design of tools, equipment and work environments with an eye towards maximizing the effectiveness of women and men as they operate in human-machine systems. (Furnham, 2005)
English
	•	Et il se mit à rire de son côté, mais comme rient les Anglais, c'est-à-dire du bout des dents. (Dumas, 1998)
Entrepreuneur
	•	to apprentice as an entrepreneur you must act on your ideas as early as possible, exposing them to the public, a part of you even hoping that you’ll fail. (Greene, 2014)
Extreme entrepreueneur
	•	At first glance these types seem to possess very positive qualities, especially for work. They maintain very high standards and pay exceptional attention to detail. They are willing to do much of the work themselves. If mixed with talent, this often leads to success early on in life. But underneath the façade the seeds of failure are taking root. This first appears in their inability to listen to others. They cannot take advice. They need no one. In fact, they mistrust others who do not have their same high standards. With success they are forced to take on more and more responsibility. (Greene, 2018)
	•	If they were truly self-reliant, they would know the importance of delegating on a lower level to maintain control on the higher level, but something else is stirring within—the Shadow. Soon the situation becomes chaotic. Others must come in and take over the business. Their health and finances are ruined and they become completely dependent on doctors or outside financiers. They go from complete control to total dependence on others. (Think of the pop star Michael Jackson near the end of his life.) (Greene, 2018)
	•	Often their outward show of self-reliance disguises a hidden desire to have others take care of them, to regress to the dependency of childhood. They can never admit this to themselves or show any signs of such weakness, but unconsciously they are drawn to creating enough chaos that they break down and are forced into some form of dependency. There are signs beforehand: recurring health issues, the sudden microneeds to be pampered by people in their daily lives. But the big sign comes as they lose control and fail to take steps to halt this. It is best to not get too entangled with such types later on in their careers, as they have a tendency to bring about much collateral damage. (Greene, 2018)
Environment
Hostile environment
	•	A hostile environment can be stimulating, enlivening, and challenging. Some people gain satisfaction from viewing themselves as lonely fighters in the wilderness, but when it comes to conflict between a large organization and a creative individual within it, the organization generally wins. (Heuer, 1999)
New environment
	•	When you enter a career or new environment, you move into a world with its own rules, procedures, and social dynamic. (Greene, 2014)
Environmental health research
	•	Environmental health research, whenever practicable and appropriate, shall include diverse segments of the population in epidemiological and clinical studies, including segments at high risk from environmental hazards, low income populations, and workers who may be exposed to substantial environmental hazards. (National Research Council (U.S.) et al., 2009)
Epidemic
Epidemic dynamic
	•	In epidemics, as in many other dynamics, heterogeneity makes a difference. Studies of errors and attacks have shown that hubs keep different parts of a network connected. This implies that they also act as bridges for spreading diseases. Their numerous ties put them in contact with both infected and healthy individuals: so hubs become easily infected, and they infect other nodes easily. The super-spreaders identified by epidemiologists are likely the hubs of social networks. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
Epidemic spread
	•	In the 14th century, physical distance was a leading factor in the spread of an epidemic. In the modern networked world, an infection can jump on a plane and reach the opposite side of the planet in a few hours. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
	•	Epidemics spread in networks both at the global level (for example, through the airport network) and at the local level: infectious diseases that jump from person to person depend on individuals’ social networks. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
	•	Pastor Satorras and Vespignani found that, after an initial phase of expansion, the virus can either be eradicated—it shrinks and finally disappears from the population—or become endemic—it sustains itself and infects a certain fraction of the population indefinitely. The disease is said to be below the epidemic threshold when, for every infected individual, fewer than one person gets infected: in this case, it becomes extinct. The disease is above the epidemic threshold if every infected individual passes the disease to more than one individual: in this case, it thrives. If vaccines are available, the disease can be pushed below the threshold by means of campaigns that immunize a sufficient portion of the population. Very contagious diseases are usually the hardest cases, because they have a low epidemic threshold and so they become endemic very easily. If eradication is too hard, pushing the disease closer to the threshold still has a positive effect: that is, reducing the proportion of people indefinitely affected by the endemic disease. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
	•	Ideally, almost all the population should be immunized to block the infection completely. However, if we can immunize just a fraction, it is not a good idea to choose people at random. Most of the times, choosing at random implies selecting individuals with a relatively low number of connections. Even if they block the disease from spreading in their surroundings, hubs will always be there to put it back into circulation. A much better strategy would be to target hubs. Inmunizing hubs is like deleting them from the network, and the studies on targeted attacks show that eliminating a small fraction of hubs fragments themad cow syndromeegu network: thus, the disease will be confined to a few isolated components. This strategy faces a practical problem: nobody really knows the full map of social connections of a human group, so it is hard to identify its hubs. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
	•	The picture of the spread of an epidemic in a social network can be partially generalized to the case in which nodes do not represent people but locations (say, airports), and what spreads on the network are people (say, infected or healthy travellers). In this case, one can define a global invasion threshold, above which the disease becomes a pandemic, and below which it remains contained at local level. Closing airports is rarely a good idea: we would need to shut down 90 per cent of airports to block certain epidemics effectively, which would have too high a social and economic cost. Cleverer strategies, such as sharing antivirals with developing countries (which are often the source of new pandemics), are much more effective. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
Epidemiologic studies 
	•	epidemiologic studies arc done in the species of ultimate interest, thus finessing the difficult problem of interspecies extrapolation. (Moolgavkar and Leubeck, 2002)
	•	Epidemiologic studies are often conducted in cohorts with occupational exposures to the agent of interest, which are typically higher than exposures in the general population. (Moolgavkar and Leubeck, 2002)
	•	epidemiologic studies gain in the way of relevance over experimental studies is lost in precision, however. (Moolgavkar and Leubeck, 2002)
	•	Epidemiologic studies can be broadly classified into three categories. The cohort study is, at least conceptually, close to the traditional experimental study in that groups of exposed and unexposed individuals are followed in time and the occurrence of disease in the two groups compared. In the case control study. relative risks are estimated from cases of the disease under investigation and suitably chosen controls. In these two types of study, information on exposures and disease is available on an individual basis for all the subjects enrolled in the study. In a third type of study, the ecological study, information is available only on a group basis. (Moolgavkar and Leubeck, 2002)
	•	When appropriate epidemiologic studies are not available, which is unfortunately the case for most agents of interest, the risk assessor has to rely on experimental data. (Moolgavkar and Leubeck, 2002)
	•	Epidemiology is the study of disease occurrence and the causes of disease while the latter fields deal primarily with occupational exposure. (Paustenbach, 2002a)
Epidemic threshold
	•	Pastor Satorras and Vespignani found that, after an initial phase of expansion, the virus can either be eradicated—it shrinks and finally disappears from the population—or become endemic—it sustains itself and infects a certain fraction of the population indefinitely. The disease is said to be below the epidemic threshold when, for every infected individual, fewer than one person gets infected: in this case, it becomes extinct. The disease is above the epidemic threshold if every infected individual passes the disease to more than one individual: in this case, it thrives. If vaccines are available, the disease can be pushed below the threshold by means of campaigns that immunize a sufficient portion of the population. Very contagious diseases are usually the hardest cases, because they have a low epidemic threshold and so they become endemic very easily. If eradication is too hard, pushing the disease closer to the threshold still has a positive effect: that is, reducing the proportion of people indefinitely affected by the endemic disease. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
	•	In their study, Pastor Satorras and Vespignani found that the epidemic threshold depends crucially on the features of the underlying network. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
Epistemic humility
	•	the recognition that regardless of how much information we collect or the extent of the analysis we do, our decisions will suffer from Hayek’s knowledge problem, and our predicted outcomes will likely turn out to be wrong. (Dudley, 2014)
Epistemological theory
	•	The difference between epistemological (political, theological) theory and scientific (political, religious) practice that emerges from these quotations is usually formulated as a difference between "certain and infallible" (or, at any rate, clear, systematic, and objective) rules, or standards, and "our fallible and uncertain faculties [which] depart from them and fall into error." (Feyerabend, 1993)
Epistemology
	•	An epistemology is a conception of what constitutes valid knowledge (or a particular kind of knowledge such as scientific knowledge). An epistemology offers solutions to three key problems: (1) what is the origin of knowledge; (2) how is the merit of knowledge established once it is created; and (3) what is meant by ‘scientific’ progress and how can this be identified (Doyal and Harris 1986) (Davies et al., 2002)
Equal-weighting schemes 
	•	A formula that combines these predictors with equal weights is likely to be just as accurate in predicting new cases as the multiple-regression formula that was optimal in the original sample. More recent research went further: formulas that assign equal weights to all the predictors are often superior, because they are not affected by accidents of sampling. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	The surprising success of equal-weighting schemes has an important practical implication: it is possible to develop useful algorithms without any prior statistical research. Simple equally weighted formulas based on existing statistics or on common sense are often very good predictors of significant outcomes. (Kahneman, 2012)
Equity-based criterion
	•	an equity-based criterion, which starts with the premise that all individuals have unconditional rights to certain levels of protection. This leads to standards, applicable to all, held to be usually acceptable in normal life, or which refer to some other premise held to establish an expectation of protection. In practice, this often converts into fixing a limit to represent the maximum level of risk above which no individual can be exposed. If the risk estimate derived from the risk assessment is above the limit and further control measures cannot be introduced to reduce the risk, the risk is held to be unacceptable whatever the benefits; (Great Britain and Health and Safety Executive, 2001)
	•	an equity-based criterion may often, in practice, require taking decisions on worst case scenarios bearing little resemblance to reality. In such cases, the decisions reached are inevitably based on procedures which systematically overestimate risks, causing undue alarm and despondency among the public or resulting in benefits achieved at disproportionate costs; (Great Britain and Health and Safety Executive, 2001)
Error
	•	the error is the growing distance between the True state and our best guess of that state. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
Representation error
	•	representation error: our models consider the population density per square kilometre, but we are measuring the number of voles in a trap, so our measurement does not represent the variable our models use. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
Escalation
	•	Decisions regarding escalation are among the most difficult leaders can face. (Ned Lebow, 2007)
Escalation of rhetoric
	•	[…] escalation of rhetoric by partisans typically occur and new recruits are drawn into the conflicts. These social alignments tend to become anchors for subsequent interpretations of risk management and may become quite firm in the face of conflicting information. (Kasperson et al., 1988)
Estimate
Order of Battle estimates
	•	Order of Battle estimates are an important part of the intelligence product available to commanders. Not only do they keep track of specific enemy units, but they also provide an approximation of the number of forces that could be faced in battle. By monitoring the combat histories and positions of particular units, analysts can estimate the quality of the forces arrayed on a given area of the battlefield. This type of information would help in planning an offensive: attacks could be directed against places held by "green" units or forces that have recently suffered heavy casualties. Conversely, the movement of well rested or battle- hardened units to a given sector could be an indication that an opponent is preparing an offensive. In any event, history suggests that disaster is the likely outcome when commanders conduct operations without an accurate estimate of the forces facing them. (Wirtz, 1991)
	•	Order of Battle estimates, which traditionally incorporated a numerical component. (Wirtz, 1991)
	•	measured progress in achieving one of the fundamental objectives. (Wirtz, 1991)
	•	Order of Battle estimates - which summarized the results of the body count, estimates of North Vietnamese infiltration, VC recruitment, and the status of specific enemy units -were used to measure progress in achieving the attrition objective. (Wirtz, 1991)
	•	In developing Order of Battle estimates, analysts at MACV monitored four different types of enemy units: NVA forces, VC main force units, VC local force units, and VC irregular forces (which included guerrilla, self-defense, and secret self-defense forces). 12 These forces were placed into categories according to which element of the communist command hierarchy controlled them and also ac- cording to their function: combat units (sometimes called maneuver units); combat support units; administrative service units; irregular units; and units that served as the VC political infrastructure. (Wirtz, 1991)
Consensus estimate
	•	Consensus estimates are ideal when they emerge naturally or when they convey basic information rather than interpretations of its implications for a matter of political controversy. (Betts, 2007)
Estimation
	•	“estimating is what you do when you do not know,” but “it is inherent in a great many situations that after reading the estimate, you will still not know.” (Betts, 2007)
Military estimation
	•	This is a situation of the enemy’s military buildup or changes in deployments, in the context of no political change in the international environment that could account for these changes (crisis, political upheaval). (Honig, 2007)
	•	it requires mainly discerning the significance of large-scale military changes underway in the enemy’s deployment of capabilities (e.g., military exercise, preparedness for attack, or a defensive posture). (Honig, 2007)
	•	This entails the laborious work of accurately integrating many bits of military data to create a whole picture or comparing a present case to similar prior incidents to trace the differences. Integrating military data into a picture is hard, but best suited for the technical skills of military experts. (Honig, 2007)
	•	When a full and specific military picture is attainable in light of the quality of information available (i.e., not severe ‘‘difficulties’’), the success of the analyst largely depends on his information processing skills. (Honig, 2007)
Estoppel
	•	[…] the concept of estoppel which in suitable circumstances can be invoked by a state so as to preclude another state from challenging the existence of a state of affairs which has been previously affirmed by it. (Naldi, 1989)
Ethic
Ethical qualities
	•	Rationality and ethical qualities must be achieved through awareness and effort. They do not come naturally. They come through a maturation process. (Greene, 2018)
Etymology
	•	etymology plays an important role both in the classical Graeco-Roman and the Judeo- Christian roots of European thought, in the Cratylus as much as in Genesis, and has a long and complex history in the West, the study of etymology in its various forms has no clear institutional place within contemporary linguistics (Malkiel, 1993: xi). Malkiel suggests this may reflect the general decline of historical disciplines (1994:1172).  (Hutton, 1998)
	•	in general the sense of the centrality of etymology has gone, and with it the intellectual excitement that saw in linguistic reconstruction the key to a 'restored picture of the world of gods and men in early times' (Mfiller, 1901:146). (Hutton, 1998)
	•	Language change, for Bréal, results from the forgetting of etymology. The meanings of names, originally transparent, were forgotten and mythologies were created: 'What had once designated a force of nature, like the sun, became the name for a god' (Nehrlich, 1992:131). Once the original meaning is forgotten, language is set adrift and is moulded by the requirements and aspirations of the people. (Hutton, 1998)
	•	Thus the forgetting of etymology is not simply a methodological principle of descriptive linguistics; it is a modemising, 'therapeutic' notion. If we are enslaved by etymology, we are enslaved to language as an object. It masters us, when we should be its master. Br6al is clearly concerned with this struggle (in Wolf, 1991: 168): It has been rightly said that words are lenses which must be carefully polished if they are not to obscure things instead of revealing them. Over-awareness of etymology is often harmful to the expression of thought, for it may disturb that thought with all kinds of false reflexions. The goal of centuries of work, as well as the advantage of having a long line of thinkers contributing to the language, is that of freeing words from the shackles of tradition, without however entirely severing their links with their cognates or with their point of origin. (Hutton, 1998)
	•	For Trench, etymology is a didactic art; to give the etymology of the word revelation is also to give its true meaning (1851:210): God's revelation of Himself is the drawing back of the veil or curtain which concealed Him from men; not man finding out God, but God declaring or discovering Himself to man; all of which lies plainly in the word. (Hutton, 1998)
	•	Lyons's statement that 'in most cases, etymology supports the average native speaker's intuitive sense of the distinction between homonymy and polysemy' (1995: 59) rests on the assumption that the native speaker's viewpoint and the etymology exist in discrete worlds, as if etymology were a fact that can be drawn into a discussion from some Platonic heaven, being otherwise an inoperative hypothesis detached from social reality. (Hutton, 1998)
	•	What this discussion illustrates is the impossibility of separating etymology from meaning, for in turning our attention to semantic problems we cannot avoid looking at prior usage. That usage cannot be separated from the process of thinking about meaning out of context, i.e. asking for the literal or basic or core meaning. When we appeal to literal meaning of a word to make a point (i.e. when we object to words like denigrate or gyp), we are involved in a process of segmentation and in so doing are appealing to etymology in the broadest sense of that term. The question of etymology in its broadest sense cannot be separated from the complex issue of linearity. (Hutton, 1998)
Etymological awareness
	•	Yet etymology and etymological awareness have played a key role in twentieth century politics of language. (Hutton, 1998)
Etymological fallacy
	•	A complex set of beliefs and practices about meaning is reduced to the 'etymological fallacy' (Lyons, 1977, vol I: 244): A particular manifestation of the failure to respect the distinction of the diachronic and the synchronic in semantics (coupled with a failure to keep distinct the descriptive and prescriptive point of view in the discussion of language) is what might be called the etymological fallacy: the common belief that the etymology of a lexeme can be determined by investigating their origins. The etymology of a lexeme is, in principle, synchronically irrelevant. The fact that the word 'curious', for example, can be traced back to the Latin 'curiosus' meaning "careful" or "fastidious" (and that it also had this meaning in earlier stages of English) does not imply that this, rather than "inquisitive", is its true or correct meaning in present-day standard English. Again, purists may object to the use of the word 'disinterested' to mean "indifferent" (rather than "impartial") by many speakers of English today; and the linguist, in his non- professional capacity, might well share their distaste for this usage. But, if this is the meaning associated with the word in the language-community whose language he is describing, this is the meaning that he must assign to it in his model of the language-system. (Hutton, 1998)
	•	Crystal (1985:113) defines the 'fallacy' as the view that an earlier (or the oldest) meaning of a word is the correct one (e.g. that history 'really' means 'investigation', because this was the meaning the etymon had in classical Greek). This view is commonly held, but it contrasts with the attitude of the linguist, who emphasises the need to describe the meanings of modern words as they are now, and not as they once may have been in some earlier state of the language (the 'oldest' state, of course, being unknown). (Hutton, 1998)
	•	The so-called 'etymological fallacy' represents a perfectly coherent philosophy of language, given that linguistic change is a legitimate source of anxiety for any society or culture founded on laws or sacred texts, whether preserved orally or in writing. The more language changes, the greater the distance between the language of daily life and the language of the foundational texts. (Hutton, 1998)
Etymological speculation
	•	Etymological speculations outside academically institutionalised linguistics continue to flourish to this day, but for the most part they are regarded as the mad alter-ego in the attic, the disruptive alternative discourse that is kept at bay by the methodology of historical linguistics. (Hutton, 1998)
	•	The point is not that we have to accept what these theorists are saying, but that these ways of thinking about language constitute meaning-giving practices. In this sense they are part of language itself. (Hutton, 1998)
	•	Reconstruction can only retrieve the true facts of language to the extent that language is itself beyond conscious human agency: Historical, nay, even individual, influences come in which prevent the science of language from becoming purely mechanical. Pott, and Curtius, and others stood up against Bopp and Grimm, maintaining that there could be nothing irregular in language, particularly in phonetic changes. If this means no more than that under the same circumstances the same changes will also take place, it would be of course a mere truism. The question is only whether we can ever know all the circumstances, and whether there are not some of these circumstances which cause what we are apt to call irregularities (Miiller, 1901: 147). (Hutton, 1998)
False etymology
	•	The boundary between respectable etymological research and speculative fantasy is a problematic one, and the issue requires treatment in greater depth than can be offered here. "[he distinction is generally drawn by an insistence on respect for sound laws and regular correspondences between sets of items, in order to avoid what Walter Skeat termed 'casual resemblances'. (Hutton, 1998)
	•	Skeat's third and eighth canons for the aspiring etymologist ran as follows (1912: 18, 27): Observe phonetic laws, especially those which regulate the mutual relation of consonants in the various Indo-germanic languages, at the same time comparing the vowel-sounds. [...] Casual resemblances between words in two unrelated languages which cannot well be brought into connexion are commonly a delusion, not to be seriously regarded. (Hutton, 1998)
	•	Skeat lamented that false etymologies, such as those proposed by the antiquarian scholars, seemed to be 'ineradicable' (1912: 28-9): One of the most mischievous is that of beltane, a name for Old May-day. It is simply the Old Irish bel- tene, 'fire-kindling'; from an old custom of kindling fires upon that day. [...] But this explanation of 'fire' from its 'brightness' was far too prosaic to suit the antiquaries of the eighteenth century and later, who were never tired of repeating that the O. Irish bel really referred to the god Baal, who was worshipped in Britain by fiery sacrifices; whence it was an easy step to the supposed existence here of 'the Ancient Phoenicians' and their heathen Semitic rites. (Hutton, 1998)
	•	The argument from sound-laws relies of course not only on the existence of such 'laws', but also on the premise of the passivity of the language users. (Hutton, 1998)
Folk etymology
	•	A folk etymology is produced 'when a word is assumed to come from a particular etymon, because of some association of form or meaning, whereas in fact the word has a different derivation, e.g. spit and image becomes spitting image' (Crystal, 1985:113). (Hutton, 1998)
	•	The term folk etymology sits uneasily within the professional terminology of linguistics. Linguists do not, for example, speak of 'folk meanings' when discussing the everyday meanings that ordinary speakers attach to words. What is it about etymology that justifies this explicit contrast between the lay speaker and the academic professional? One answer to this would be the Saussurean principle that the ordinary speaker of the language is blind to linguistic history. It would follow from that principle that, as Ross puts it, 'an etymology cannot ever be a matter for discussion between a philologist and a non-philologist' (1958: 69). (Hutton, 1998)
	•	ne could imagine a range of phenomena being referred to as folk etymology, from unconscious re-analysis of compound forms to the conscious 'making transparent' of an expression. (Hutton, 1998)
Ethnographic traditions
	•	the discourse analysis and ethnographic traditions make use of more 'qualitative' and 'descriptive' methods. (Ellis, 2006)
Equation
Lotka-Volterra equations
	•	the Lotka-Volterra equations, and their generalizations, can analyse the interactions of selected species. (Holland, 2014)
Evacuation
Evacuation problem
	•	Shoreham's future rested on the "evacuation problem," which itself consisted of two subproblems: establishing what would be considered legitimate expert knowledge and establishing the very definition of what was possible.  (Clarke, 1999)
Evaluation
	•	[…] evaluation is a political, aesthetic, and moral matter (Douglas, 2005:31)
	•	The process of evaluation entails the allocation of meaning and value/affect to identity contents, new and old. (Breakwell, 2014)
Retrospective evaluation
	•	Retrospective evaluation should be standard procedure in those fields in which estimates are routinely updated at periodic intervals. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	The goal of learning from retrospective evaluation is achieved, however, only if it is accomplished as part of an objective search for improved understanding, not to identify scapegoats or assess blame. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	This requirement suggests that retrospective evaluation should be done routinely within the organizational unit that prepared the report, even at the cost of some loss of objectivity. (Heuer, 1999)
Evasion
	•	Les évasions heureuses, les évasions couronnées d'un plein succès, sont les évasions méditées avec soin et lentement préparées. (Dumas, 1998)
Event
	•	An event is an occurrence in time or “a thing that happens or takes place” (FrameNet). (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Events, as occurrences, include accidents, wars, attacks, structural failures, etc. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	The even is useful to identify because we could calculate the risk more accurately after assessing the likelihood of the event occurring and the reutrns from such an event. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	in military and foreign affairs, where the patterns are at best difficult to fathom, there may be many events for which there are no valid causal explanations. This certainly affects the predictability of events and suggests limitations on what might logically be expected of intelligence analysts. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	analysts tend to assume that economic events have primarily economic causes, that big events have important consequences, and that little events cannot affect the course of history. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Fischer notes: In short, it appears that the defeat of the Armada, mighty and melodramatic as it was, may have been remarkably barren of re- sult. Its defeat may have caused very little, except the disruption of the Spanish strategy that sent it on its way. That judgment is sure to violate the patriotic instincts of every Englishman and the aesthetic sensibilities of us all. A big event must have big results, we think (Heuer, 1999)
	•	People also have a better memory for recent events, events in which they were personally involved, events that had important consequences, and so forth. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Events that are likely to occur usually are easier to imagine than unlikely events. People are constantly making inferences based on these assumptions. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	when events occur, people tend to overestimate the extent to which they had previously expected them to occur. And conversely, when events do not occur, people tend to underestimate the probability they had previously assigned to their occurrence. In short, events generally seem less surprising than they should on the basis of past estimates. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	In any event, pressed by circumstances, we feel usually energized and focused. (Greene, 2014)
	•	When an event occurs or when we meet a new person, we do not stop to consider all aspects or details, but instead we see an outline or pattern that fits into our expectations and past experiences. We fit the event or person into categories. (Greene, 2014)
	•	We humans tend to live in the moment. It is the animal part of our nature. We respond first and foremost to what we see and hear, to what is most dramatic in an event. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Most of the time we are improvising and reacting to events with insufficient information. Basically we are in denial about this because it is hard to have perspective about our own decision-making process. (Greene, 2018)

Abnormal event
	•	An abnormal event attracts attention, and it also activates the idea of the event that would have been normal under the same circumstances. (Kahneman, 2012)

Unusual events
	•	Unusual events (such as botulism) attract disproportionate attention and are consequently perceived as less unusual than they really are. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	unusual events are easier than normal events to undo in imagination (Kahneman, 2012)
Rare events
	•	The emotional arousal is associative, automatic, and uncontrolled, and it produces an impulse for protective action (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	The probability of a rare event is most likely to be overestimated when the alternative is not fully specified (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	The probability of a rare event will (often, not always) be overestimated, because of the confirmatory bias of memory. Thinking about that event, you try to make it true in your mind. A rare event will be overweighted if it specifically attracts attention (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	‘fat-tailed’ behaviour, where rare events (e.g. mass extinctions and market crashes) occur much more often than would be predicted by a normal (bell-curve) distribution. (Holland, 2014)
Significant event
	•	the significant event here is the release of material by rupture or discharge, when the release creates a hazards or hazardous condition and countermeasures fail to recover the situation immediately. This in turn can lead to harm and damage. (Wells, 1996)
	•	Heavy things make heavy noises; dainty things move daintily; large animals leave large tracks. When dealing with physical properties, such inferences are generally correct. (Heuer, 1999)
Invisible event
	•	When events are invisible or poorly defined, they carry little or no weight in shaping our attitudes and opinions. (Slovic, 1993)
Negative event
	•	Negative events are the basis for the erosion of trust and, since they are more likely to grab attention than positive events, trust is more likely to be destroyed than built. Since risk events are typically negative, it does suggest that trust will be eroded at the very moment that risk amplification processes will come into play. (Breakwell, 2014)
	•	Negative (trust-destroying)events are more vis- ible or noticeable than positive (trust-building) events. (Slovic, 1993)
	•	Negative events often take the form of specific, well-defined incidents such as accidents, lies, discoveries of errors, or other mismanagement. (Slovic, 1993)
	•	When events do come to our attention, negative (trust-destroying) events carry much greater weight than positive events. (Slovic, 1993)
Bad events
	•	The brains of humans and other animals contain a mechanism that is designed to give priority to bad news. (Kahneman, 2012)
Positive events
	•	Positive events, while sometimes visible, more often are fuzzy or indistinct. (Slovic, 1993)
Human, monetary and political costs of a major event
	•	In principle at least, the different forms of harm that could follow from a very large accident could be added up and given a money value, provided of course that one is prepared to attach a value to the loss of human life. The things to be added would consist of: (a) the price put on the loss of life adjusted for society's known extra aversion to multiple loss of life; (b) the cost of coping with the emergency, the loss of plant destroyed or abandoned, of land rendered unproductive, and of opportunities for other investments foregone; and (c) the costs, if they could be estimated, of shock and disruption to social and political life.
Return of an event
	•	The return of an event are the changes experienced by an affected entity. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	The returns of the event are separate things, such as death or injury. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Returns and events are routinely conflated, sometimes for justifiable convenience when the returns are unknown. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Conflation of events and returns is colloquially justifiable, but not analytically justifiable. Strictly speaking, we would be wrong to talk of a potential accident or potential war or potential building collapse as a risk (each is a potential event, but not a potential return); we should be self-disciplined enough to talk of a potential event with which we should associate potential returns (risks), while keeping the event and the returns separate. (Newsome, 2013)
Issue
	•	An issue or an incident is an event that requires a response. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	An issue is “an important topic for debate or resolution”. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Issues are useful to separate from other events, because issues require further action, while other events can be ignored. (Newsome, 2013)
Strategic shocks
	•	The MOD adds strategic shocks, which are “high impact event that have the potential to rapidely alter the strategic context” or result “in a discontinuity or an abrupt alteration in the strategic context” or “dislocates the strategic context from the trends that have preceded it.”. (Newsome, 2013)
Social event
	•	Au même titre que la vie individuelle, la vie des groupes est marquée par l’alternance. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	ponctuée de temps à autre par un événement saillant. Celui-ci peut avoir un caractère purement occasionnel ou accidentel (guerre, séisme, épidémie) ou se présenter, au contraire, sous les aspects d’un phénomène récurrent.
	•	Son retour est alors prévisible, inscrit dans une certaine régularité, voire au calendrier (fêtes, rites, commémorations). (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	La vie quotidienne apparaît ainsi fondamentalement constituée de temps faibles quantitativement les plus nombreux et de temps forts qui introduisent une alternative à la monotonie. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Nous croyons pouvoir affirmer que cette alternance et cette récurrence sont saines et restauratrices de l’organisation sociale : les fonctions de représentation et d’imagination sont activées et le désir de nouveauté partiellement satisfait, au moins au niveau symbolique. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Par conséquent, tout ce qui est susceptible de modifier cette platitude est accueilli avec intérêt, même lorsqu’il s’agit d’expériences éprouvantes ou bouleversantes :
	•	Or, parler de rythme et d’alternance revient à introduire, dans la compréhension de la vie sociale, l’idée d’une discontinuité. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Le flux quotidien connaîtrait de la sorte diverses « phases » ou « moments » suivant la proximité ou l’éloignement d’un temps fort. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Le monotone, le banal seraient contrastés par des expériences émotionnellement riches, parfois même tumultueuses, qui apportent l’indispensable renouvellement de l’horizon affectivo-intellectuel et modifient la vitesse de déroulement des faits journaliers. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	les exigences de la réalité sont là qui relâchent, de temps en temps, la pression des obligations, des interdits et surtout met un terme à leur affligeante répétition. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	La vie collective reposerait de la sorte sur le jeu alternatif de tout ce qui, dans l’histoire de la société, va dans le sens de la congruence, d’une plus grande homogénéité toujours à parfaire ou à refaire, et de ce qui, a contrario, s’efforce de dénouer ce qui est établi pour promouvoir la nouveauté sous toutes ses formes. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Jamais totalement rassuré sur son identité et sa pérénité, le corps social paraît perpétuellement à la recherche de lui-même et de ce qui est susceptible de lui fournir les assurances dont il a besoin. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	vertige de l’inconscient collectif qui est tissé dans la trame même du groupe, « sa texture, voire son texte », et qui semble inhérent à la vie de tout groupe :
	•	On comprend alors que se mette en place, au sein de la société, tout un ensemble de procédures dont le but est d’atteindre une toujours problématique cohérence-congruence de ce qui, dans le corps social, semble caractérisé par la fluctuation et la tendance au changement. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	La démarche s’effectue par tâtonnements multiples et nécessite des ajustements qui ne sont jamais définitifs. Les institutions les plus stables en apparence sont elles aussi sujettes aux modifications et parfois au bouleversement. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	C’est ainsi que l’on peut désigner les efforts de cohérence que fait le groupe. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Les grands bouleversements qui précèdent les changements de civilisations, tels que la chute de l'Empire romain et la fondation de l'Empire arabe par exemple semblent, au premier abord, déterminés surtout par des transformations politiques considérables: invasions de peuples ou renversements de dynasties. Mais une étude plus attentive de ces événements montre que, derrière leurs causes apparentes, se trouve le plus souvent, comme cause réelle, une modification profonde dans les idées des peuples. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Les seuls changements importants, ceux d'où le renouvellement des civilisations découle, s'opèrent dans les idées, les conceptions et les croyances. Les événements mémorables de l'histoire sont les effets visibles des invisibles changements de la pensée des hommes. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	qu'il n'est rien d'aussi stable dans une race que le fond héréditaire de ses pensées. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	la pensée des hommes est en voie de se transformer. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	l'âge moderne représente une période de transition et d'anarchie. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	une puissance nouvelle, dernière souveraine de l'âge moderne: la puissance des foules. (Lebon, 1895)
Pattern event
	•	People expect patterned events to look patterned, and random events to look random, but this is not the case. Random events often look patterned. (Heuer, 1999)
Random event
	•	Random events often look patterned. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	events will almost never be perceived intuitively as being random; one can find an apparent pattern in almost any set of data or create a coherent narrative from any set of events. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Because of a need to impose order on their environment, people seek and often believe they find causes for what are actually random phenomena. (Heuer, 1999)
Event causation
	•	Events that occur over time are difficult to link causally if only because they always involve multiple interactive causation (Mill 1882). We have found about a dozen repeating patterns of causal reasoning, and the simple cause-effect chain is one of the least frequent of them (Klein and Hoffman 2009). Other patterns involve complex causation. (Hoffman et al., 2011)
Event control
	•	Remember that greater control over events will come from realistic assessments of the situation, precisely what is made most difficult by a brain submerged in trivia. (Greene, 2018)
Event likelihood
	•	Cognitive research suggests that judgments about the likelihood of events often reflect the “availability” and vividness of memories about similar types of events. (Fishbein and Treverton, 2004)
Framing event
	•	The framing event, which is said to constitute a particular event schema, also contributes to the argument structure of the event predicate and the semantic characteristics of the arguments within. (Workshop on Classifier Constructions and Emmorey, 2003)
	•	The framing event may be substantiated or supported by certain co-events. (Workshop on Classifier Constructions and Emmorey, 2003)
	•	According to Talmy, the framing event can be applied to different conceptual domains.
	•	PATH is argued to constitute the core schema of the framing event. (Workshop on Classifier Constructions and Emmorey, 2003)
	•	Framing refers to the process whereby we organize reality – categorizing events in particular ways, paying attention to some aspects rather than others, deciding what an experience or event means or how it came about. The term is used to refer to how we interpret our everyday encounters with the world around us. It is also used to refer to how a picture ‘frame’ a scene, and how a newspaper ‘frame a story. (Devereux, 2007)
	•	Any representation of reality involved framing. If you take a photograph you are literally ‘framing’ the scene – freezing an image of a moment in time, from a particular perspective. Through the view-finder you select your focus, decide what to foreground and what to leave in the background, and excluse some aspects of the scene from the frame altogether. The resulting photograph does not show the whole of the landscape, it necessarily iframes’ a particular view. (Devereux, 2007)
	•	a newspaper report cannot tell the reader everything. Journalists frame a story by selecting the ‘relevant’ facts and placing an event in what they consider to be the appropriate context. They tell the stoy in ways which highlight particular ideas about the nature of the event. (Devereux, 2007)
	•	the subordinate event can be held to constitute an event of circumstance in relation to the macro-event as a whole and to perform functions of support in relation to the framing event. (Talmy and Talmy, 2003)
	•	The framing event determines to a large extent the temporal framework, syntactic structure and the semantic roles of the arguments, and a co-event that is often lexically the more specific of the two (Talmy 2000:213). (Senft and Australian National University, 2008)
Future event
	•	the future events analysts try to predict are not deterministic. (Rosenberg, 2008)
Sudden event
	•	Sudden and dramatic events have more impact on peoples’ beliefs than do those that unfold more slowly. (Jervis, 2010)
Dramatic event
	•	Sudden and dramatic events have more impact on peoples’ beliefs than do those that unfold more slowly. (Jervis, 2010)
	•	We humans tend to live in the moment. It is the animal part of our nature. We respond first and foremost to what we see and hear, to what is most dramatic in an event. (Greene, 2018)
Hazardous events
	•	Hazardous events are events at the boundary of the system under consideration that may lead to an accident. (Cook, 2008)
Real event
	•	Real events involve sudden random intrusions and accidents. Reality is messy and the pieces rarely fit so perfectly. (Greene, 2018)
Evidence
	•	evidence is about the past’ (Stilgoe et al., 2006)
	•	evidence does not speak for itself (Stilgoe et al., 2006)
	•	Evidence can support policies and it can challenge them (Stilgoe et al., 2006)
	•	As the astronomer Carl Sagan (and later Donald Rumsfeld) said: ‘Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.’ (Omand, 2014)
	•	Evidence comes from an unusually diverse set of sources: newspapers and wire services, observations by American Embassy officers, reports from controlled agents and casual informants, information exchanges with foreign governments, photo reconnaissance, and communications intelligence. Each source has its own unique strengths, weaknesses, potential or actual biases, and vulnerability to manipulation and deception. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	In general, you should never accept the validity of people’s ideas because they have supplied “evidence.” Instead, examine the evidence yourself in the cold light of day, with as much skepticism as you can muster. Your first impulse should always be to find the evidence that disconfirms your most cherished beliefs and those of others. That is true science. (Greene, 2018)
Evaluation of evidence
	•	Evaluation of evidence is a crucial step in analysis, but what evidence people rely on and how they interpret it are influenced by a variety of extraneous factors. 
	•	Information presented in vivid and concrete detail often has unwarranted impact, and people tend to disregard abstract or statistical information that may have greater evidential value. We seldom take the absence of evidence into account. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	The human mind is also oversensitive to the consistency of the evidence, and insufficiently sensitive to the reliability of the evidence. (Heuer, 1999)
Scientific evidence
	•	Scientific evidence is preferred, precisely because it benefits from the public’s confidence in science and can often overcome the cloud of uncertainty that hangs over other forms of evidence—although such evidence may at the same time be resented for its special status in the mind of the jury. (Weiss, 2008)
Evidence-based policy
	•	evidence-based policy often overlooks the uncertainties that come to define our problems (Stilgoe et al., 2006)
	•	‘evidence-based’ turn in policy sees experts as providers of information, giving answers to policy questions. (Stilgoe et al., 2006)
	•	the quest for evidence-based policy (EBP) has turned increasingly to systematic reviews of the results of previous inquiries in the relevant policy domain. However, this shifting of the temporal frame for evaluation is in itself no guarantee of success. (Pawson, 2002)
	•	This concept of ‘evidence-based policy’ has been gaining currency over the last decade. The 1999 White Paper on Modernising government clearly adopted it as part of its philosophy:This Government expects more of policy makers. More new ideas, more willingness to question inherited ways of doing things, better use of evidence and research in policy making and better focus on policies that will deliver long term goals. (Solesbury, 2001)
	•	Analysis of evidence helps to answer the questions ‘what works? and ‘what happens if we change these settings?. (Head, 2008)
	•	Evidence-based policy is believed to provide great assistance in answering some of the key questions of New Public Management (NPM). (Head, 2008) 
	•	Finding a clear definition of evidence-based policy is difficult. (Marston and Watts, 2003)
	•	The term ‘evidence-based policy’ is based around two sets of related assumptions, ‘one referring to the way in which policy is made, the other to the evidential nature of social science itself’ (Young et al. 2002, p. 215). (Marston and Watts, 2003)
	•	The concept of evidence-based policy has an intuitive, common sense logic, which partly explains how it has become naturalised in a diverse range of policy settings.
	•	The term ‘evidence-based policy’ has evolved from the concept of evidence-based practice, both of which were preceded by evidence-based medicine. (Marston and Watts, 2003)
	•	Evidence-based medicine (EBM) is the process of systematically finding, appraising, and using research findings as the basis for clinical decisions. (Marston and Watts, 2003)
	•	In 1998, the Commonwealth Department of Health and Family Services was talking about the need to translate evidence-based medicine into evidence-based policy, defined as assisting the provision of safe, cost-effective, and beneficial treatments (Whitworth 1998). (Marston and Watts, 2003)
	•	The Department of Family and Community Services (DFaCS) Annual Report 2000– 01 refers to evidence-based policy, by way of ‘making administrative data more accessible to the Minister, DFaCS staff and the Australian community’ (DFaCS 2001). (Marston and Watts, 2003)
	•	For Latham, evidence-based policy represents tool or metaphor for going beyond political ideology. He treats evidence-based policy as a neutral concept where ‘hard facts’ will speak for themselves in addressing ‘human tragedy’ and politicians and policy makers will act accordingly based on the best available evidence. (Marston and Watts, 2003)
	•	Following Toulmin (1958, see also Toulmin & Janik 1978) we suggest that the core features of all evidence-based arguments consist of the following irreducible elements: an implied or identified question; a claim or proposition that such and such is the case or that such and suchexplains or renders intelligible; the evidence adduced in support of that claim or proposition; a set of assumptions that have assisted in a) shaping the question, b) selecting what will count as the relevant evidence and c) which then link the evidence to the claim by means of conceptual processes that warrant the proposed link between the claim and the evidence actually advanced. (Marston and Watts, 2003)
Environment
	•	Knowing your environment better will present many opportunities for power. (Greene, 2018)
Environemental niche
	•	Environmental niche conservatism explains the accumulation of species. (Skeels and Cardillo, 2017)
Evolution
	•	[E]volution is not to be understood as a series of tournaments for the occupation of a fixed set of environmental niches. … Instead evolution brings about a proliferation of niches. (Holland, 2014)
	•	Evolution seems to have selected specific motifs, because of their optimal properties, (e.g. because they use the smaller number of genes necessary to perform a certain function). (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
Creationism
	•	Creationism speaks of the world as adapted to man. (Coker, 2009)
Darwinian evolution
	•	Darwinian evolution by natural selection speaks of humanity as fitted for survival in the world. (Coker, 2009)
	•	Darwinian environment it is knowledge which enables groups to adapt faster. (Coker, 2009)
	•	Darwinists these days no longer talk of the survival of the fittest, so much as the survival of the best-informed. (Coker, 2009)
	•	Darwinism, however, has evolved since Darwin. We see evolution itself as a form of information-processing which allows those species that can process it more quickly than others to survive and thrive. (Coker, 2009)
Evolutionary engineering’
	•	Complexity inheres not in the original design but ‘evolutionary engineering’ (Martin 2006:190−1). (Coker, 2009)
	•	evolutionary engineering allows human interven- tion as a system reaches an evolutionary dead-end. (Coker, 2009)
	•	Evolutionary engineering is not random because humans set goals, of which the most important is performance. (Coker, 2009)
Exaggerated Emotional Coherence (Halo Effect) 
	•	The term has been in use in psychology for a century, but it has not come into wide use in everyday language. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	the halo effect is a good name for a common bias that plays a large role in shaping our view of people and situations. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	evidence accumulates gradually and the interpretation is shaped by the emotion attached to the first impression (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	The halo effect is also an example of suppressed ambiguity (Kahneman, 2012)
Exaltation
	•	L’exaltation eut effectivement déboucher sur la violence : on assiste alors à des manifestations sado-masochistes à caractère mystique (processions de flagellants, amputations délibérément consenties et vouées à la divinité) ou politique. Des révoltes éclatent en embrasements soudains et sauvages (émeutes, jacqueries, soulèvements accompagnés de meurtres, d’atrocités diverses, de pillages). (Mannoni, 1985)
Exceedance probability curve 
	•	An EP curve specifies the probabilities that a certain level of losses will be exceeded. The losses can be measured in terms of dollars of damage, fatalities, illness or some other unit of analysis. (Renn, 2007b)
	•	By its nature, the EP curve inherently incorporates uncertainty associated with the probability of an event occurring and the magnitude of dollar losses. (Renn, 2007b)
	•	The EP curve also serves as an important tool for evaluating risk manage- ment options, thus assisting managers to optimize risk reduction. It puts pressure on experts to state the assumptions on which they are basing their estimates of the likelihood of certain events occurring and the resulting consequences. (Renn, 2007b)
	•	In fact, EP curves, such as those depicted in Figure 2.2, supple- mented by a discussion of the nature of these assumptions, should enable the assessors to both characterize interpretative ambiguities and provide a framework for risk managers to test the efficiency of risk reduction options. (Renn, 2007b)
Expectation
	•	Expectations have many diverse sources, including past experience, professional training, and cultural and organizational norms. All these influences predispose analysts to pay particular attention to certain kinds of information and to organize and interpret this information in certain ways. (Heuer, 1999)
Pattern of expectation
	•	This experiment shows that patterns of expectation become so deeply embedded that they continue to influence perceptions even when people are alerted to and try to take account of the existence of data that do not fit their preconceptions. Trying to be objective does not ensure accurate perception. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Analysts do not just have expectations about the color of hearts and spades. They have a set of assumptions and expectations about the motivations of people and the processes of government in foreign countries. Events consistent with these expectations are perceived and processed easily, while events that contradict prevailing expectations tend to be ignored or distorted in perception. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	This tendency of people to perceive what they expect to perceive is more important than any tendency to perceive what they want to perceive. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Patterns of expectations tell analysts, subconsciously, what to look for, what is important, and how to interpret what is seen. These patterns form a mind-set that predisposes analysts to think in certain ways. A mind-set is akin to a screen or lens through which one perceives the world. (Heuer, 1999)
Experience
	•	experience is not the same thing as good knowledge. Experience can lead usastray.  (Clarke, 1999)
	•	Experience, indeed, can lead us to believe that we're safer—or more at risk—than we really are. (Clarke, 1999)
	•	we do have ways to learn that seem to go beyond direct experience. (Clarke, 1999)
	•	experience doesn't speak for itself but instead requires the proper frame of reference. Those frames can turn experience into knowledge, or noise. (Clarke, 1999)
	•	because officials had a stake in keeping those systems running, they turned a blind eye to that experience. Put differently, they constructed their frames of reference so that the danger-indicating experience was noise rather than knowledge. (Clarke, 1999)
	•	Experience (data) never speaks for itself. (Clarke, 1999)
Negative experience
	•	Negative and traumatic experiences can have a constricting effect—they close our minds off to anything that might possibly make us reexperience the original pain. (Greene, 2018)
Traumatic experience
	•	Negative and traumatic experiences can have a constricting effect—they close our minds off to anything that might possibly make us reexperience the original pain. (Greene, 2018)
Experts
	•	Experts are woven into the fabric of government [...] their status as scientists – usually independent university scientists – gives them rhetorical power. (Stilgoe et al., 2006)
	•	The physicist Werner Heisenberg defined an expert as ‘someone who knows some of the worst mistakes that can be made in their subject and who manages to avoid them’. (Stilgoe et al., 2006)
	•	A working definition of an expert is a person who can solve a problem faster or better than others, but who runs a higher risk than others of posing the wrong problem. (Perrow, 1999)
	•	Experts are just human in the end. They are dazzled by their own brilliance and hate to be wrong. Experts are led astray not by what they believe, but by how they think (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	Experts are not infallible. They have made terrible mistakes, with ghastly consequences. (Nichols, 2017)
	•	Experts can be wrong in many ways, from outright fraud to well- intentioned but arrogant overcon dence in their own abilities. And sometimes, like other human beings, they just make mistakes. (Nichols, 2017)
	•	Despite what most people think, experts and policymakers are not the same people, and to confuse the two, as Americans o en do, corrodes trust among experts, citizens, and political leaders. (Nichols, 2017)
	•	Experts advise. (Nichols, 2017) 
	•	Experts, too, have an important responsibility in a democracy, and it is one they’ve shirked in recent decades. (Nichols, 2017)
	•	Experts have a responsibility to educate. (Nichols, 2017)
	•	experts have an obligation to help. (Nichols, 2017)
	•	Experts should be able to identify a risk that outsiders either inflate (because they fear it) or deflate (because they do not understand why they should fear it). (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Experts are just as likely to disagree as they are to agree. (Coker, 2009)
	•	experts are always disagreeing with each other. (Coker, 2009)
	•	Experts win government contracts and business consultancies by challenging other experts on contract to other government agencies or NGOs. Knowledge has become corrigible. (Coker, 2009)
	•	All experts, by definition, are specialists, some of whom, in the words of Giddens, are intent on trying to ‘colonize a personal future’ (i.e. to make their names and with it their fortunes) (Beck 1997:88). (Coker, 2009)
	•	Many experts (to quote Jan Myrdal) have become the ‘whores of reason’ − expertise itself has become a commodity to be bought and sold like everything else. (Coker, 2009)
	•	The expert knows the adversary’s character—sometimes too well. (Betts, 2007)
	•	The expert perceives his or her own judgmental process, including the number of different kinds of information taken into account, as being considerably more complex than is in fact the case. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Experts overestimate the importance of factors that have only a minor impact on their judgment and underestimate the extent to which their decisions are based on a few major variables. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Since  the  word  “expert”  is  semantically  related  to  the  word“expertise”, the former deriving from the latter, both words are used interchangeably. (Germain and Enrique Ruiz, 2009)  

Expert judgement
	•	Several studies have shown that human decision makers are inferior to a prediction formula even when they are given the score suggested by the formula! (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	Another reason for the inferiority of expert judgment is that humans are incorrigibly inconsistent in making summary judgments of complex information. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	Since experts also exhibit cultural biases in their selections of theories, methods, and data, these variable public perceptions will also often differ as a group from those of experts. (Kasperson et al., 1988)
	•	Expert judgment is used in a few systems to give qualitative or semi-quantitative scores to chemicals (e.g. high, medium, low). Extensive use of qualitative judgement may lead to results not being scientifically reproducible. (Swedish Chemicals Agency et al., 2007)
	•	Studies have found experts’ judgements to be neither consistent with the judgement of others, nor internally consistent with their own. (Coker, 2009)
	•	Experts usually are better predictors than those who know less about a question, but in unusual situations the nonexpert may do better. Intelligence and policy certainly cannot live without experts. (Betts, 2007)
	•	Even experts suffer from systematic errors and biases when estimating probabilities. (Evans, 2014)
Expert advice
	•	Expert advice needs to blend different people and perspectives (Stilgoe et al., 2006)

Expert wisdom
	•	Expert wisdom is about navigating uncertainty, reminding people in power what we still might not know, in addition to what we think we know, and cautioning against complacency (Stilgoe et al., 2006)

Committees of experts 
	•	Governments rely on committees of experts rather than individuals because the committee will have a collectively wider range of knowledge and the committee’s discussion will strengthen their advice (Stilgoe et al., 2006)
Experts panel
	•	Expert panels composed of nonagency scientists should be used either to perform risk assessments for an agency or to review assessments developed by agency staff. (National Research Council, 1983)
Expert knowledge
	•	Expert knowledge plays a central role in the definition of risks and therefore in risk perception. (Griner, 2002)
Security expert
	•	The role of security experts is changing, but perhaps it is time to reflect on the way academics are handling their post-Cold War role. (Rasmussen, 2004)
Non-expert
	•	Nonexpert principals have difficulty arbitrating intellectu- ally between experts who disagree. (Betts, 2007)
	•	A nonspecialist, by virtue of his comparative ignorance of all the powerful reasons to bet on continuity, is more susceptible to exceptional thinking. (Betts, 2007)
	•	The non-expert may naively view the enemy as a generic chess player or as a mirror image of our own way of thinking—views that normally prompt misunderstanding but are more open to the possibility that a normally predictable enemy will act out of character. (Betts, 2007)
Expertise
	•	expertise has always been about more than evidence. Expertise is also about judgement, about wisdom, about asking new questions and challenging convention (Stilgoe et al., 2006)
	•	The acquisition of expertise in complex tasks such as high-level chess, professional basketball, or firefighting is intricate and slow because expertise in a domain is not a single skill but rather a large collection of miniskills  (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	Expertise is not a single skill; it is a collection of skills, and the same professional may be highly expert in some of the tasks in her domain while remaining a novice in others. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	expertise and accuracy are unrelated. (Coker, 2009)
	•	expertise is the combination of knowledge, experience, and skills held by a person in a specific domain. (Germain and Enrique Ruiz, 2009)
	•	Expertise can also be used as a performance measure to develop employees for optimal performance. (Germain and Enrique Ruiz, 2009)
	•	Torraco  and  Swanson  (1995)  further  assert  that “business  success increasingly hinges on an  organization’s ability  to use  its employees’  expertise  as afactor in the shaping of its business strategy”. (Germain and Enrique Ruiz, 2009)
	•	expertise in employees for the purpose of improving performance. (Germain and Enrique Ruiz, 2009)
	•	Expertise is what employerswant to see in their employees. (Germain and Enrique Ruiz, 2009)
	•	Since  the  word  “expert”  is  semantically  related  to  the  word“expertise”, the former deriving from the latter, both words are used interchangeably. (Germain and Enrique Ruiz, 2009)
	•	expertise  has  three  dimensions: knowledge, problem-solving skills, and experience. (Germain and Enrique Ruiz, 2009)
	•	scarcity of expertise severe knowledge gaps and uncertainties. (Hannemann-Weber et al., 2012) 
	•	Large consulting irms, such as McKinsey and Deloitte, routinely generate analytics-driven reports to communicate their findings and, in the process, establish their expertise in specific knowledge domains. (Haider, 2016)
Limit of expertise
	•	Recognizing the occasional limitations of expertise must not be mistaken for a dismissal of its importance. (Betts, 2007)
Objective expertise
	•	Objective expertise usually leads to informed awareness. (Newsome, 2013)
Experience
	•	Experience is the best teacher, in this sense: having an experience is the best way or perhaps the only way, of coming to know what that experience is like. (Lewis, 1988)
	•	Experience can give us “information” that no amount of lessons can give. (Lewis, 1988)
	•	experience is said to enter science at three points: testing; assimilation of the results of test; understanding of theories. (Feyerabend, 1993)
	•	most human activities are based on experience rather than analysis. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
Experiment
	•	The experiments reflect basic human processes that affect analysis of any subject. (Heuer, 1999)
Expiation
	•	Au goût du mystère s’ajoute le sacrifice des victimes expiatoires, dont l’exécution renouvelée à intervalles réguliers entretient périodiquement le lien social. (Mannoni, 1985)
Explanation
Causal explanation
	•	When evidence is first received, people postulate a set of causal connections that explains this evidence. (Heuer, 1999)
Exposure
	•	An acute exposure generally involves one contact with the chemical; usually for less than a day. (Paustenbach, 2002a)
	•	Exposure refers to the contact of the source agent with the target (individuals, ecosystems, buildings, etc.). (Renn, 2011)
	•	Exposure often is treat as synonymous with vulnerability (and even risk), but exposure implies that we are sunject to the threat, while vulnerability implies our lack of defenses against the threat. We are subject to the threat if we coincide with or are discovered by the threat in ways that allow the threat to target us. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	FrameNet defines the verb to expose as to “reveal the ture, objectionable nature of” something. (Newsome, 2013)
Threat exposure
	•	The more militarly context. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	In military contexts, exposure implies that we are under observation by a threat; but in financial contexts, exposure implies the things that could be lost. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	The target’s revelation to the potential threat. (Newsome, 2013)
Loss exposure
	•	The more financial context.
Chronic exposure
	•	An exposure is considered chronic when it takes place over a substantial portion of the person's lifetime. (Paustenbach, 2002a)
Subechronic exposure
	•	Exposures of intermediate duration are called subehronic. (Paustenbach, 2002a)
Exposure by time
	•	We are exposed in time whenever the threat is coincident with us or knows where we are and van target us at that time. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	We could measure our exposure in time in either absolute terms (such as days exposed) or proportional terms (such as the fraction of the year). (Newsome, 2013)
	•	We could make the measure judgemental: For instance, one judgmental scheme assigns a value between 1 and 5 to correspond respectively with rare, quarterly, weekly, daily, or constant exposure (Waring & Glendon, 1998, pp. 27-28). (Newsome, 2013)
Expression
Baseline expression
	•	In observing any particular individual over time, you need to establish their baseline expression and mood. Some people are naturally quiet and reserved, their facial expression revealing this. Some are more animated and energetic, while still others continually wear an anxious look. Aware of a person’s usual demeanor, you can pay greater attention to any deviations—for instance, sudden animation in someone who is generally reserved, or a relaxed look from the habitually nervous. Once you know a person’s baseline, it will be much easier to see signs of dissimulation or distress in them. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Related to the baseline expression, try to observe the same person in different settings, noticing how their nonverbal cues change if they are talking to a spouse, a boss, an employee. (Greene, 2018)
Microexpression
	•	The microexpression is a recent discovery among psychologists who have been able to document its existence through film. It lasts less than a second. There are two varieties of this: The first comes when people are aware of a negative feeling and try to suppress it, but it leaks out in a fraction of a second. The other comes when we are unaware of their hostility and yet it shows itself in quick flashes on the face or in the body. These expressions will be a momentary glare, tensing of the facial muscles, pursing of the lips, the beginnings of a frown or sneer or look of contempt, with the eyes looking down. Aware of this phenomenon, we can look for these expressions. You will be surprised at how often they occur, because it is nearly impossible to completely control the facial muscles and repress the signs in time. You must be relaxed and attentive, not obviously looking for them but catching them out of the corner of your eye. Once you begin to notice such expressions, you will find it easier to catch them. (Greene, 2018)
Free expression
	•	for instance, the way in which a culture that espouses the ideal of free expression is charged with an oppressive code of political correctness that tamps free expression down. (Greene, 2014)
External involvement
	•	External involvement is analysed by the use of ‘penetration’ and ‘overlay’. (Buzan and Wæver, 2003)
Externatlities
	•	The question of what the problem really is has a lot to do with the role of "externalities." These are the social costs of an activity (pollution, injuries, anxieties) that are not reflected in the price of the activity. These social costs are often borne by those who do not even benefit from the activity, or, if they do, are unaware of the externalities. Externalities are important in the case of high-risk systems because of, for example, the costs of clean up from toxic substances, or of rebuilding after a dam failure. (Perrow, 1999)
Extinction
	•	The possibility of a sudden transition from a resilient behaviour to a global collapse should ring some alarm bells. In ecosystems, a certain rate of extinction is inevitable: one in each million of species becomes extinct every year, according to some estimates. Usually, foodwebs rearrange after these events, and most of the species do not suffer major damage from these natural extinctions. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)

F
Facial expression
	•	Facial expression (smile or frown) provides the cues for assessing the stranger’s intentions. (Kahneman, 2012)
Faith
	•	Laissons donc la raison aux philosophes, mais ne lui demandons pas trop d'intervenir dans le gouvernement des hommes. Ce n'est pas avec la raison et c'est le plus souvent malgré elle, que se sont créés des sentiments tels que l'honneur, l'abnégation, la foi religieuse, l'amour de la gloire et de la patrie, qui ont été jusqu'ici les grands ressorts de toutes les civilisations. (Lebon, 1895)
Failure
	•	Mistakes and failures are precisely your means of education. (Greene, 2014)
	•	There are two kinds of failure. The first comes from never trying out your ideas because you are afraid, or because you are waiting for the perfect time. This kind of failure you can never learn from, and such timidity will destroy you. The second kind comes from a bold and venturesome spirit. (Greene, 2014)
	•	Mistakes and failures elicit the need to explain. (Greene, 2018)
Small-scale failure
	•	Small-scale failure [accidents] can be produced very rapidly (Stech, 1979)
Large-scale failure
	•	large-scale failure [i.e, disaster] can only be produce if time and resources are devoted to them”. (Stech, 1979)
Failure of foresight
	•	Failure of foresight. Turner defines this central characteristic of disaster development as a collapse of precautions previously regarded as culturally adequate, producing alarm, disaster, or catastrophe, and requiring widespread reevaluation of previously accepted precautions and defenses. (Stech, 1979)
Failure of control
	•	Failure to control (on alarm) implies that corrective systems applied already fail to prevent the trend and that further steps taken by the operator, probably alerted by alarm, to correct the situation have also failed. (Wells, 1996)
Failure of emergency control
	•	failure of emergency control means that any further emergency control systems – such as automatic shutdown systems, process relief or action by the operators following a set procedure – have failed to control the situation. (Wells, 1996)
Dramatic failure
	•	Dramatic failures occur only intermittently. (Betts, 2007)
Political failure
	•	political failure that is a direct out-growth of a nation's defense posture (and other policy flaws). (Hopple, 1984)
Technical warning failure
	•	Technical warning failure, when the relevant information is simply not collected or processed quickly enough, is relatively rare with respect to major military attacks, although processing and distribution snafus are far from irrelevant. (Hopple, 1984)
Repeated failure
	•	Repeated failure will toughen your spirit and show you with absolute clarity how things must be done. (Greene, 2014)
False alarm
	•	‘‘false alarms’’ paradoxically reduce the source’s credibility, although the information may be true (i.e., not disinformation). (Honig, 2007)
Failure analysis
	•	‘‘Failure analysis’’ is a standard methodology for investigating the breakdown of a system or machine […].(Michaels, 2008)
Fairness
	•	Impartiality and fairness (also one of the main factors of deliberation) are important elements of any regulatory decision that will have an impact on public trust, and are cornerstones of a just society. (Löfstedt, 2005)
	•	There are two ways to measure fairness in regulation: either via the process itself or through the outcome of the process. Fairness is usually defined by a view of the process or outcome as being impartial. (Löfstedt, 2005)
	•	Tenez, moi qui n'ai jamais fait une mauvaise action à part ce que je vous ai raconté, moi, je suis dans la misère ; moi, après avoir vu mourir ma pauvre femme de la fièvre, sans pouvoir rien faire pour elle, je mourrai de faim comme est mort le père Dantès, tandis que Fernand et Danglars roulent sur l'or. – Et comment cela  ? – Parce que tout leur a tourné. (Dumas, 1998)
Fairness hypothesis
	•	Rather than focusing on probabilities and magnitudes of undesired events, this approach emphasizes societal preferences for principles of achieving consent to a technology, distributing liabilities, and investing trust in institutions. (Rayner and Cantor, 1987)
Feminine
Feminin qualities
	•	All of us have masculine and feminine qualities—some of this is genetic, and some of it comes from the profound influence of the parent of the opposite sex. (Greene, 2018)
	•	But in the need to present a consistent identity in society, we tend to repress these qualities, overidentifying with the masculine or feminine role expected of us. And we pay a price for this. We lose valuable dimensions to our character. Our thinking and ways of acting become rigid. Our relationships with members of the opposite sex suffer as we project onto them our own fantasies and hostilities. You must become aware of these lost masculine or feminine traits and slowly reconnect to them, unleashing creative powers in the process. You will become more fluid in your thinking. In bringing out the masculine or feminine undertone to your character, you will fascinate people by being authentically yourself. Do not play the expected gender role, but rather create the one that suits you. (Greene, 2018)
Hyperfeminine
	•	Pay special attention to those who are hypermasculine or hyperfeminine. You can be sure that below the surface lurks a very feminine anima for the man and a very masculine animus for the woman. When people go extra far in repressing their feminine or masculine qualities, these will tend to leak out in a caricatured form. (Greene, 2018)
	•	The hyperfeminine woman will often be concealing a great deal of repressed anger and resentment at the role she has been forced to play. Her seductive, girlish behavior with men is actually a ploy for power, to tease, entrap, and hurt the target. Her masculine side will leak out in passive-aggressive behavior, attempts to dominate people in relationships in underhanded ways. Underneath the sweet, deferential façade, she can be quite willful and highly judgmental of others. Her willfulness, always under the surface, will come out in rather irrational stubbornness in petty matters. (Greene, 2018)
Fanatic
	•	You are impressed by their fervor, in support of whatever cause. They speak forcefully. They allow for no compromise. They will clean things up, restore greatness. They radiate strength and conviction, and because of this they gain followers. They have a flair for drama and capturing attention. But at the key moment when they could possibly deliver what they have promised, they unexpectedly slip up. They become indecisive at the wrong moment, or burn themselves out and fall ill, or take such ill-conceived actions that it all falls apart. It’s as if they have suddenly lost belief, or secretly wanted to fail. (Greene, 2018)
	•	The truth is that such types have massive insecurities from early on in life. They have doubts about their self-worth. They never felt loved or admired enough. Riddled with fears and uncertainty, they cover this up with the mask of great belief, in themselves and in their cause. You will notice in their past some shifts in their belief system, sometimes radical. That is because it is not the particular belief that matters but the intense conviction, and so they will shift this around to fit the times. Belief in something is like a drug for them. But the doubts return. They secretly know they cannot deliver the goods. And so under stress they become the opposite—indecisive and secretly doubtful. They suddenly fire their assistants and managers to give the impression of action, but unconsciously they are sabotaging themselves with unnecessary change. They have to blow it all up, somehow and yet blame others. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Never be taken in by the strength of people’s convictions and their flair for drama. Always operate by the rule that the greater the stridency in what they say, the deeper the underlying insecurities and doubts. Do not become a follower. They will make a fool of you. (Greene, 2018)

Un tel état d’esprit est naturellement propre à conduire à des désordres de toutes natures car la radicalité qui l’anime est susceptible d’induire les individus aux pires extrémités. Les débordements auxquels ils se livrent alors empruntent le plus souvent les voies de la violence extrême car elle est l’expression la plus immédiate de puissantes plulsions agressives qui habitent l’homme et n’attendent qu’une occasion pour se manifester. veut imposer sa croyance aux autres, l’absence de tolerance est totale”. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Pour ce qui regarde la violence faites aux autres, elle est accomplie avec la parfaite bonne consicence de ceux qui exécutent les ennemis de Dieu et accomplissent par là même son œuvre. Aussi rien leur paraît injsute ou cruel, rien n’est trop fort dans ce qui châtie les hérétiques. Les fanatiques sont purs et durs. (Mannoni, 1985)
Fanatism
	•	Une de ses manifestations les plus nettes et les plus dangeureuses à la fois est probablement le fanatisme. Ce phénomène, religieux par essence (fanum = temple), contient toute la force que l’homme inestit dans la foi, même lorsque cette fois concerne des “objets” séculiers. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Le fanatisme reste toujours identique à lui-même. “Seul (l’)objet varie. On trouve les mêmes traits de caractère chez ceux qui sont possédés, et on les voit se livre à des pratiques similaires”. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Le fanatique voue une passion aveugle, une foi jalousie, à l’objet qu’il a par ailleurs sacralise. On comprend qu’ainsi magnifié cet objet (famille, chef, parti, état) soit exclusive de tout autre et determine un attachement monome. Les consequences d’un tel investissement sont redoutables.

(Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Le fanatisme est donc près du délire ; on pourrait aussi l’appeler paranoia sociale. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	veut imposer sa croyance aux autres, l’absence de tolerance est totale”. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	L'intolérance et le fanatisme constituent l'accompagnement nécessaire d'un sentiment religieux. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Tous les fondateurs de croyances religieuses ou politiques ne les ont fondées que parce qu'ils ont su imposer aux foules ces sentiments de fanatisme qui font que l'homme trouve son bonheur dans l'adoration et l'obéissance et est prêt à donner sa vie pour son idole. (Lebon, 1895)
Fantasy
	•	Fantasies, however incredible, are deliberate cognitive manipulations of the behaviors and meanings of everyday life. (Dreams, which are also obviously fantasies, are irrele- vant here.) Most fantasies are recognized as such by the fantasizers, and would be similarly recognized by others were they to hear thedetails of the fantasy. And as long as fantasies remain confined to the realm of the purely mental, few of us would be willing to judge them inappropriate or ill-conceived as guides for individual, or collective, behavior. What harm, or good, can a whimsical speculation do? (Clarke, 1999)
Fantasy documents
	•	the production of fantasy documents always results from interaction between two or more players. (Clarke, 1999)
	•	fantasy documents are self-conscious lies, deliberately designed by powerful executives and cunning experts to hide their true interests, and to dupe the public into believing things that aren't true (Clarke, 1999)
	•	symbolic plans, which I call fantasy documents, are rhetorical instruments that have political utility in reducing uncertainty for organizations and experts. (Clarke, 1999)
	•	the key uncertainties that fantasy documents are trying to turn into risks have to do with how future events will evolve, and how future actors will respond to those events. (Clarke, 1999)
	•	Fantasy documents are thus based on an underlying sociological theory of events, meanings, and behaviors. (Clarke, 1999)
	•	Fantasy documents, generally, are not constructed to deliberately dupe various audiences (though they can have that effect) but are more prosaically rooted in organizational processes that are endemic to modern society. (Clarke, 1999)
	•	transforming incredible uncertainties into quite manageable risks. (Clarke, 1999)
	•	When fantasy documents are presented to audiencesasif they were anything other than flights of fancy, and when organiza- tions and audiences start to act as if such fantasies actually reflect organizational capabilities, we then see deception, obfuscation, or worse. (Clarke, 1999)
	•	I've said that lack of experience is a key factor behind the production of fantasy documents. (Clarke, 1999)
	•	Some plans are highly instrumental, but others are little more thanvague hopes for remote futures and have virtually no known connec-tion with human capacity or will. These are plans that are not func-tional in the sense of serving as blueprints for coordination and actionbut are functional in the sense of asserting to others that the uncontrol-lable can be controlled. Such plans are sometimes produced cynicallyby organizations and experts, and often have the effect of mollifyingthe public or other organizations. More often, I think, they are pro-duced earnestly by organizations and experts who truly believe in theirown constructions. Either way, the plans are fantasy documents, imagi-native fictions about what people hope will happen after things gowrong. They are fantasies either because the promises they make cannever be fulfilled (as is the case for oil spills) or because we can never know whether they will be fulfilled (as is the case for nuclear evacuation and nuclear civil defense) until major catastrophe befalls us. (Clarke, 1999)
	•	Fantasy documents are rationality badges, symbol's organizations use to signal they are in control of danger, whether they really are or not. These rationality badges originate in the everyday routines that organizations develop in response to problems, and in the social conflict engendered by organizations that produce them. Once produced, they are usually set in a rhetoric of technical competence, and often enough in one of national interest, providing a context that helps persuade (internal and external) audiences of their legitimacy. When audi- ences grant such legitimacy, fantasy documents work to set terms of political debate by shaping vocabularies within which discussion occurs. In this way fantasy documents justify and support systems that seem increasingly beyond our comprehension and control. (Clarke, 1999)
	•	Fantasy documents read like scripts for plays or movies. They specify relevant actors and the story lines those actors are supposed to pur- sue: the high-level military officials are "tasked" to protect the national interest, the dispersant contactors will make most of the oil go away, the bus drivers will ferry people out of the way of a glowing, melted reactor core. (Clarke, 1999)
	•	Fantasy documents describe the scenery, necessarily neglecting much as they construct the organizational stage upon which the fantasy will presumably work itself out. Fantasy documents detail the timing of assault, of reaction, and of recovery: when the bombs will drop, when the "all clear" will be sounded, when it will be safe for wildlife to return to their home waters. (Clarke, 1999)
	•	Fantasy documents, like moviescripts, have a definite beginning, middle, and end, and the construction of these stories very much depends on who the audience is thought to be for them. In these ways, fantasy documents can be remarkably coherent, though the coherence is internal and thus uncomplicated by external forces and ambiguity: it is always clear who is firing the missiles, the requisite technology for oil spill response is at hand, people will evacuate during a radiological emergency without first collectingtheir children from school. (Clarke, 1999)
	•	The coherence of organizational coordination and the simplicity ofsociety that we find in fantasy documents are remarkable. (Clarke, 1999)
	•	The fan- tasy is that most things will work right the first time, that most of the crucial contingencies are known and have been prepared for. (Clarke, 1999)
	•	Planning to survive (and thus win) a nuclear war is fantasy planning. (Clarke, 1999)
	•	Symbolic plans are fantasy documents. Fantasies are whimsical speculations, flights of fancy in which scenarios are imagined with little regard to usual constraints of "reality." Fantasies, however incredible, are deliberate cognitive manipulations of the behaviors and meanings of everyday life. (Clarke, 1999)
	•	Fantasies, however incredible, are deliberate cognitive manipulations of the behaviors and meanings of everyday life. (Dreams, which are also obviously fantasies, are irrele- vant here.) Most fantasies are recognized as such by the fantasizers, and would be similarly recognized by others were they to hear thedetails of the fantasy. And as long as fantasies remain confined to the realm of the purely mental, few of us would be willing to judge them inappropriate or ill-conceived as guides for individual, or collective, behavior. What harm, or good, can a whimsical speculation do?It seems that fantasy documents are more likely to be produced to defend very large systems, or systems that are newly scaled up. (Clarke, 1999)
Fate
	•	For thousands of years, we humans believed in fate: some kind of force—spirits, gods, or God—compelled us to act in a certain way. At birth our entire lives were laid out in advance; we were fated to succeed or fail. (Greene, 2018)
	•	If we are honest with ourselves, we must admit there is some truth to the concept of fate. We are prone to repeat the same decisions and methods of dealing with problems. There is a pattern to our life, particularly visible in our mistakes and failures. But there is a different way of looking at this concept: it is not spirits or gods that control us but rather our character. (Greene, 2018)
	•	People are generally indifferent to your fate, not as antagonistic as you imagine. Very few of their actions are really directed at you. (Greene, 2018)
Farsight perspective
	•	It would seem, then, that wisdom tends to come to us when it is too late, mostly in hindsight. But there is in fact a way for us humans to manufacture the effect of time, to give ourselves an expanded view in the present moment. We can call this the farsighted perspective, and it requires the following process. (Greene, 2018)
	•	First, facing a problem, conflict, or some exciting opportunity, we train ourselves to detach from the heat of the moment. We work to calm down our excitement or our fear. We get some distance.Next, we start to deepen and widen our perspective. In considering the nature of the problem we are confronting, we don’t just grab for an immediate explanation, but instead we dig deeper and consider other possibilities, other possible motivations for the people involved. We force ourselves to look at the overall context of the event, not just what immediately grabs our attention. We imagine as best we can the negative consequences of the various strategies we are contemplating. We consider how the problem or the apparent opportunity might play itself out over time, how other problems or issues not apparent in the moment might suddenly loom larger than what we are immediately dealing with. We focus on our long-term goals and realign our priorities in the present according to them. (Greene, 2018)
	•	In other words, this process involves distance from the present, a deeper look at the source of problems, a wider perspective on the overall context of the situation, and a look further into the future— including the consequences of our actions and our own long-term priorities. (Greene, 2018)
	•	As we go through this process, certain options and explanations will begin to seem more logical and realistic than others that grabbed us in the moment. We add to this the lessons we have learned over the years about our own patterns of behavior. In this way, though we cannot re- create the full effect that time has on our thinking, we can approximate it. Most often the passing months give us even more information and reveal better options for us to have taken. We are manufacturing this effect in the present by widening what we consider and opening our minds. We are moving up the mountain. Such an elevated perspective can calm us down and make it easier for us to maintain our presence of mind as events unfold. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Although this stands as an ideal, we must admit that such a perspective is rare among us humans. It seems to require an effort that is almost beyond us. The reason for this is simple: short-term thinking is hardwired into our system; we are built to respond to what is immediate and to seek out instant gratification. For our early human ancestors, it paid to notice what was potentially dangerous in the environment or what offered an opportunity for food. The human brain as it evolved was designed not to examine the full picture and context of an event but to home in on the most dramatic features. This worked well in a relatively simple environment and amid the simple social organization of the tribe. But it is not suited to the complex world we now live in. It makes us take notice mostly of what stimulates our senses and emotions, and miss much of the larger picture. (Greene, 2018)
	•	When we strive to go against this grain, to consider more deeply the consequences of what we do and the nature of our long-term priorities, we are straining to realize our true human potential as the thinking animal. And just as short-term thinking can be contagious, one individual who embodies the wisdom of the farsighted perspective can have an immensely positive effect on the people around him or her. Such individuals make us aware of the larger picture and reveal a mind-set that we recognize as superior. We want to imitate them. (Greene, 2018)
	•	If possible, avoid deep contact with those whose time frame is narrow, who are in continual react mode, and strive to associate with those with an expanded awareness of time. (Greene, 2018)
Fascism
	•	Fascism was an extremist de­ fense of the bourgeois economy threatened by crisis and by proletarian subversion. Fascism is a state ofsiege in capitalist society, by means of which this society saves itself and gives itself stop-gap rational ization by making the State intervene massively in its management. But this rationalization is itself marked by the immense irrationality of its means. (Debord, 2012)
	•	Fascism rallies to the defense of the main points of a bourgeois ideology which has become conservative (the family, property, the moral order, the nation), reuniting the petite-bourgeoisie and the unemployed routed by crisis or deceived by the impotence of social ist revolution . However, fascism is not itself fundamentally ideological. It presents itself as it is: a violent resurrection of myth which demands participation in a community defined by archaic pseudo-values: race, blood, the leader. (Debord, 2012)
	•	Fascism is technically-equipped archaism. Its decomposed ersatz of myth is revived in the spectacular context of the most modern means of con­ ditioning and illusion. Thus it is one of the factors in the formation of the modern spectacle, and its role in the destruction of the old workers' movement makes it one of the fu ndamenta l forces of present-day society. However, since fascism is also the most costly form of preserving the capitalist order, it must naturally leave the front of the stage to the great roles played by capitalist States; it is eliminated by stronger and more rational forms of the same order. (Debord, 2012)
Fashion
	•	la mode, satisfaisant à la fois un désir de réunion avec les autres, et son contraire, désir d’originalité. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	la mode serait bien « ce système social de régulation » qui est « l’un des moteurs de l’évolution sociale ». (Mannoni, 1985)
Fashion style
	•	In human culture, we can see a phenomenon—changes in fashions and styles—that at first glance might appear trivial, but that in fact is quite profound, revealing a deep and fascinating part of human nature. Look at clothing styles, for instance. In the stores or in fashion shows we can perhaps detect some trends and changes from a few months before, but they are usually subtle. Go back to styles ten years ago and, compared with the present, the differences are quite apparent. Go back twenty years and it is even clearer. With such a distance in time, we can even notice a particular style of twenty years ago that now probably looks a bit amusing and passé. (Greene, 2018)
	•	These changes in fashion styles that are so detectable in increments of decades can be characterized as creating something looser and more romantic than the previous style, or more overtly sexual and body conscious, or more classic and elegant, or gaudier and with more frills. (Greene, 2018)
Fault tree
	•	schematic drawings showing all the things that might go wrong with any endeavor. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Fault trees are often used to study the fallibility of complex systems such as a nuclear reactor or space capsule.(Heuer, 1999)
Fear
	•	Fear can also be learned—quite easily, in fact—by words rather than by experience. (Kahneman, 2012) 
	•	on n'a pas besoin de connaître le danger pour craindre ; il y a même une chose à remarquer, c'est que ce sont justement les dangers inconnus qui inspirent les plus grandes terreurs. (Dumas, 1998)
Fear appeals
	•	Fear appeals, whether in narrative format or not, focus attention primarily on the threat, leaving less cognitive processing capacity available to continue taking in and making sense of further information (4). (Downs, 2014) 
Feedback
	•	In cybernetic terms information-processing can be seen as a form of feedback. (Coker, 2009)
	•	The concept of feedback, therefore, is intimately connected with network patterns. (Coker, 2009)
Feedback loop
	•	The message we want to send can travel along a cyclical path which may become a feedback loop. (Coker, 2009)
	•	The concept of  feedback-loop dominance is central to the system  dynamics paradigm. (Richardson, 1995)
	•	In complex systems-high-order, multi loop nonlinear feedback systems-behavior over time depends on which of the many feedback processes in the system dominates. (Richardson, 1995)
	•	At any moment in the evolution of the system, some feedback loops will be highly influential and others will be inactive. Because of nonlinearities, loop dominance  often shifts as the behaviour. (Richardson, 1995)
	•	As the system enters new regions of  state space, latent loops that have had no role in the behaviour may suddenly become active, causing qualitative changes in the mode of behavior. (Richardson, 1995)
	•	Endogenous shifts in loop dominance are responsible for shifts from, for example, exponential growth to decline or from stability to instability-they are responsible for bifurcations. These nonlinear interactions lie at the heart of  many important behaviors observed in models. (Richardson, 1995)
	•	The causal loop or feedback loop in system dynamics is claimed to be central in understanding human, organizational, and machine behavior (Senge, 1990; Forrester, 1980). The causal loop represents the instrumental actions that one makes within a complex system, and their associated feedback chain. The notion of the causal loop concurs that control and communication both happen via messages passed between entities, forming a complete interactive loop. (Yacci, 2000)
Negative feedback 
	•	Negative feedback mechanisms are introduced to achieve a self-shutdown in case of device failure or when the operator loses control. Two classical examples are the safety-valve that lets out steam when the pressure becomes too high in a steam-boiler and the dead man’s handle that stops the train when the driver falls asleep. (Swedish Chemicals Agency et al., 2007)
	•	we define a negative feedback loop as a topology whose links, starting from any node in the loop, lead back to the original node with the cumulative sign of regulatory links within the loop being negative. (Ma et al., 2009)
Topological feedback entropy
	•	a measure of theinherent rate at which a map on a noncompact topological spacewith inputs generates stability information. (Nair et al., 2004)
	•	a rigorous andcompletely general measure of the rate at which a plant gen-erates initial state information under certain controllability-likeconstraints. (Nair et al., 2004)
Feeling
	•	Emotion, feeling and affect are seemingly equated. (Sjöberg, 2006)
Fetichism
Commodity fetishism
	•	This is the principle of commodity fetishism, the domination of society by “intangible as well as tangible things,” which reaches its absolute fulfillment in the spectacle, where the tangible world is replaced by a selection of images which exist above it, and which simultaneously impose themselves as the tangible par excellence. (Debord, 2012)
Figure
	•	c'était une figure ; une sorte de vision sur laquelle s'entrecoupaient le réel et le fantastique, comme l'ombre et le jour. (Hugo and Chamarat, 1998)
Financial stakeholders
	•	Financial stakeholders may wait until a broader picture emerges in relatively slow media. (Kleinnijenhuis et al., 2015)
Finubacci number
	•	The numbers in the series 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 . . . are called Fibonacci numbers (Fibonacci was a nickname of Leonardo of Pisa), and they arise again and again in nature: in the structure of sunflowers, pine cones, and pineapples. They are of interest here because they illustrate exponential growth in time, almost. (Smith and Smith, 2007).
Flattery
	•	We are all prone to flattery because of our Self-love. (Greene, 2018)
	•	people will charm and flatter us and, blinded by our desire to like them, we fail to look deeper and see the character flaws. (Greene, 2018)
	•	The key to successful flattery is to make it strategic. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Never follow up your praise with a request for help, or whatever it is you are after. Your flattery is a setup and requires the passage of some time. Do not appear too ingratiating in the first encounter or two. Better to show even a little coldness, which will give you room to warm up. After a few days you have grown to like this person, and then a few flattering words aimed at their insecurities will begin to melt their resistance. If possible, get third parties to pass along your compliments, as if they had simply overheard them. Never be too lavish in your praise or use absolutes. (Greene, 2018)
	•	courtiers have to gain the attention of leaders and ingratiate themselves in some way. The most immediate way to do this is through flattery, since leaders inevitably have large egos and a hunger to have their high self-opinion validated. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Flattery can do wonders, but it comeswith risks. If it is too obvious, the flatterer looks desperate, and it is easy to see through the strategy. The best courtiers know how to tailor their flattery to the particular insecurities of the leader and to make it less direct. They focus on flattering qualities in the leader that no one else has bothered to pay attention to but that need extra validation. If everyone praises the leader’s business acumen but not his or her cultural refinement, you will want to aim at the latter. Mirroring the leader’s ideas and values, without using their exact words, can be a highly effective form of indirect flattery. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Keep in mind that forms of acceptable flattery will differ in each court. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Adapt your flattery to the group spirit, and make it as indirect as possible. (Greene, 2018)
Flexibility
	•	In general terms, ‘flexibility’ can be defined as the ability of a force structure or capability to adapt rapidly to threats that have not been explicitlyconsidered in advance. (Frühling, 2014)
	•	In a sense, flexibility is thus a general buffer against uncertainty. (Frühling, 2014)
	•	Achieving flexibility involves significant costs, because of the need for strategic mobility assets, especially transport aircraft and ships, and because configurational and functional flexibility mean that the advantages of effectiveness and efficiency that arise from specialization are forgone. (Frühling, 2014)
	•	Let us define the ideal state of the mind as one that retains the flexibility of youth along with the reasoning powers of the adult. Such a mind is open to the influence of others. And just as you use strategies to melt people’s resistance, you must do the same on yourself, working to soften up your rigid mental patterns. (Greene, 2018)
	•	When it comes to the ideas and opinions you hold, see them as toys or building blocks that you are playing with. Some you will keep, others you will knock down, but your spirit remains flexible and playful. (Greene, 2018)
Functional flexibility
	•	Functional flexibility, or ‘versatility’, is the ability of a given unit to switch between different roles, or perform several roles at once, such as combat operations, peacekeeping, humanitarian assistance or training of friendly forces. (Frühling, 2014)
Flow
	•	The psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi (pronounced six-cent-mihaly) has done more than anyone else to study this state of effortless attending, and the name he proposed for it, flow, has become part of the language. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	People who experience flow describe it as “a state of effortless concentration so deep that they lose their sense of time, of themselves, of their problems,” and their descriptions of the joy of that state are so compelling that Csikszentmihalyi has called it an “optimal experience.” Many activities can induce a sense of flow, from painting to racing motorcycles—and for some fortunate authors I know, even writing a book is often an optimal experience. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	Flow neatly separates the two forms of effort: concentration on the task and the deliberate control of attention. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	In a state of flow, however, maintaining focused attention on these absorbing activities requires no exertion of self-control, thereby freeing resources to be directed to the task at hand. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	flow provides the velocity of X for any point in the state space. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
Focus groups
	•	provide an open-ended forum for hearing many people at once. (Fischhoff, 2013)
	•	focus groups cannot probe individuals’ views at depth, shield participants from irrelevant group pressure, or distinguish the beliefs that people bring to a group session from those that they learn in it. (Fischhoff, 2013)
	•	focus groups are much more common in commercial research than in scientific studies. (Fischhoff, 2013)
	•	focus groups are not large statistically representative samples from which one can extrapolate to the general population, they are useful as qualitative indicators of public issues and concems. (Golding et al., 1992)
Focusing illusion
	•	The focusing illusion creates a bias in favor of goods and experiences that are initially exciting, even if they will eventually lose their appeal. Time is neglected, causing experiences that will retain their attention value in the long term to be appreciated less than they deserve to be. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	The mistake that people make in the focusing illusion involves attention to selected moments and neglect of what happens at other times (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	
Food chain
	•	Every food chain starts with basal species, such as plants and bacteria. These do not prey on any other species and take resources directly from the environment by transforming light, minerals, and water. These resources are transferred along the food chain by successive predations. Intermediate species are organisms that are both predators and prey. And top species (at the end of the chain) are those that are not predated by anything. Food chains help us understand why fisheries collapse, as the Peruvian anchovy fishery in the seventies. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
	•	food chains are not isolated, but interwoven in intricate patterns, where a species belongs to several chains at the same time. For example, a specialized species may predate on only one prey (or in some cases on only a few). If the prey becomes extinct, the population of the specialized species collapses, giving rise to a set of co-extinctions. An even more complicated case is where an omnivore species predates a certain herbivore, and both eat a certain plant. A decrease in the omnivore’s population does not imply that the plant thrives, because the herbivore would benefit from the decrease and consume even more plants. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
	•	As more species are taken into account, the population dynamics can become more and more complicated. This is why a more appropriate description than ‘foodchains’ for ecosystems is the term foodwebs (Figure 5). These are networks in which nodes are species and links represent relations of predation. Links are usually directed (big fishes eat smaller ones, not the other way round). These networks provide the interchange of food, energy, and matter between species, and thus constitute the circulatory system of the biosphere. They are the blood vessels of the Earth. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
	•	in foodwebs, pollutants introduced in one species at a given location are brought by foodchains to apparently unrelated species as far away as on the opposite side of the planet. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
	•	Basal species get energy and matter from sun and environment, but their predators extract just 10 per cent, on average, of the resources conaitned in them, and the same happens at every successive step of predation: if foodchains were too long, top predators would not extract enough from them to survive. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
	•	Foodwebs are divided into compartments: groups of species interacting more strongly among themselves than with others. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
	•	The possibility of a sudden transition from a resilient behaviour to a global collapse should ring some alarm bells. In ecosystems, a certain rate of extinction is inevitable: one in each million of species becomes extinct every year, according to some estimates. Usually, foodwebs rearrange after these events, and most of the species do not suffer major damage from these natural extinctions. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
	•	In foodwebs, population dynamics can produce a reorganization of the network. When overfishing pushes a species below a cerain level, the foodweb rearranges the predations and new species take the place of the old one. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
Fool
	•	fools carry with them a different scale of values. They place more importance on short-term matters—grabbing immediate money, getting attention from the public or media, and looking good. They are ruled by their ego and insecurities. They tend to enjoy drama and political intrigue for their own sake. When they criticize, they always emphasize matters that are irrelevant to the overall picture or argument. They are more interested in their career and position than in the truth. You can distinguish them by how little they get done, or by how hard they make it for others to get results. They lack a certain common sense, getting worked up about things that are not really important while ignoring problems that will spell doom in the long term. (Greene, 2014)
	•	The natural tendency with fools is to lower yourself to their level. They annoy you, get under your skin, and draw you into a battle. In the process, you feel petty and confused. You lose a sense of what is really important. You can’t win an argument or get them to see your side or change their behavior, because rationality and results don’t matter to them. You simply waste valuable time and emotional energy. (Greene, 2014)
	•	In dealing with fools you must adopt the following philosophy: they are simply a part of life, like rocks or furniture. All of us have foolish sides, moments in which we lose our heads and think more of our ego or short-term goals. It is human nature. Seeing this foolishness within you, you can then accept it in others. (Greene, 2014)

Fourfold pattern
	•	The fourfold pattern of preferences is considered one of the core achievements of prospect theory. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	systematic deviations from expected value are costly in the long run—and this rule applies to both risk aversion and risk seeking. Consistent overweighting of improbable outcomes—a feature of intuitive decision making—eventually leads to inferior outcomes. (Kahneman, 2012)

Forecasting method
	•	The forecasting method that Flyvbjerg applies is similar to the practices recommended for overcoming base-rate neglect: Identify an appropriate reference class (kitchen renovations, large railway projects, etc.).; Obtain the statistics of the reference class (in terms of cost per mile of railway, or of the percentage by which expenditures exceeded budget). Use the statistics to generate a baseline prediction; Use specific information about the case to adjust the baseline prediction, if there are particular reasons to expect the optimistic bias to be more or less pronounced in this project than in others of the same type. (Kahneman, 2012)
Forecast
	•	forecast is a probabilistic statement, on a relatively high confidence level, about the future (Jantsh 1967, p. 15) (Sottilotta, 2016)
	•	A forecast, in contrast, is energizing and empowering (Bauer, 2014) (Sottilotta, 2016) 
	•	A forecast implies uncertainty (we would be forecasting that an event could occur). (Newsome, 2013)
	•	no forecast is complete without a useful estimate of forecast uncertainty. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
	•	Those who venture to predict have long been criticized even when their forecasts prove accurate, in a technical sense. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
	•	There is always the possibility that a forecast be internally consistent from the modellers’ perspective while actively misdirecting the forecast user’s expectations. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
	•	We must contend both with observational uncertainty and with model inadequacy. Interpreting an ensemble forecast of the real world as if it were a perfect model probability forecast of a mathematical system is to make the most naïve of forecasting blunders. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
Emsemble forecast
	•	By making an ensemble forecast we can examine alternatives consistent with our current knowledge of the atmosphere and our models. This provides significant advantages for informed decision support. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
In-sample forecast
	•	After results have been extracted from data mining, you do a formal evaluation of the results. Formal evaluation could include testing the predictive capabilities of the models on observed data to see how effective and efficient the algorithms have been in reproducing data. This is known as an in-sample forecast. (Haider, 2016) 
Linear systems forecasting
	•	The goal of forecasting linear systems is to minimize this distance: the forecast error. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
Nonlinear systems  forecasting
	•	When forecasting nonlinear systems it becomes important to distinguish the various things bound up in this quantity, including uncertainties in observation, truncation in measurement, and the difference between our mathematical models, our computer simulations of them, and whatever it was that actually generated the data. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
Foreign policy
	•	In foreign policy only simple facts, or explanations of minor matters about which policymakers know or care little, are uncontroversial. Assessments of facts on matters of much importance are always controversial. (Betts, 2007)
Foregrounding
	•	‘Foregrounding’, the verb, means to make permanent or draw attention to particular features of a phenomenon. (Coker, 2009)
	•	In the case of the risk age and in the specific case of war I shall contend that we can foreground it in an acute appreciation of the growing complexity of the world and the increasing risks that inhered in going to war, at least (and perhaps only) for the leading powers. (Coker, 2009)
Formula
	•	Comme toutes les formules, ells experiment en raccourci, sous forme d’un cliché commode, et par-delà la caricature, un certaine verité. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	puissance spéciale des mots et des formules. Il faut les choisir de façon à ce qu'ils évoquent des images très vives. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	in the relationship between systems of communication and the exercise of power. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
Fractal
Fractal of chaos
	•	the fractals of chaos are mathematical objects found in state spaces. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
Fractal properties of natures
	•	Physicists speak of the "fractal" properties of nature, by which they mean that the units that comprise a larger structure tend to look like that larger structure. (Clarke, 1999)
Physical fractal
	•	a physical fractal only displays the properties of a fractal at certain length scales and not at others. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
Natural fractal
	•	Clouds, mountains, and coastlines are common examples of natural fractals; statistically self-similar objects that exist in real space. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
Framework 
	•	It distinguishes the process from the “framework’ (the “set of components that provide the foundations and organizational arrangements for designing, implementing, monitoring, reviewing, and continually improving risk management throughout the organization”) (Newsome, 2013)
Framing
	•	Framing refers to the process whereby we organize reality – categorizing events in particular ways, paying attention to some aspects rather than others, deciding what an experience or event means or how it came about. The term is used to refer to how we interpret our everyday encounters with the world around us. It is also used to refer to how a picture ‘frame’ a scene, and how a newspaper ‘frame a story. (Devereux, 2007)
	•	Any representation of reality involved framing. If you take a photograph you are literally ‘framing’ the scene – freezing an image of a moment in time, from a particular perspective. Through the view-finder you select your focus, decide what to foreground and what to leave in the background, and excluse some aspects of the scene from the frame altogether. The resulting photograph does not show the whole of the landscape, it necessarily iframes’ a particular view. (Devereux, 2007)
	•	a newspaper report cannot tell the reader everything. Journalists frame a story by selecting the ‘relevant’ facts and placing an event in what they consider to be the appropriate context. They tell the stoy in ways which highlight particular ideas about the nature of the event. (Devereux, 2007)
Frame analysis
	•	frame analysis is thus the term used when researchers try to unpich the processes through which a frame is presented. (Devereux, 2007)
Frequency
	•	A frequency is the number of events per defined unit of time, for example, “100,00 deaths to cancer per year.”. (Newsome, 2013)
French
	•	C'est vrai, reprit Danglars, les Français ont cette supériorité sur les Espagnols, que les Espagnols ruminent et que les Français inventent.  (Dumas, 1998)
Friendship
	•	Empirical research has confirmed this early conjectures: adult friendships are highly homogeneous in social and demographic statuses, race and ethnicity, beliefs, and interests, and that observed homogeneity is higher than it would be expected by considering random-choice models. (Hassan et al., 2011)
	•	individuals tend to choose their friends from among those with whom they have regular contact in one or another of their focused activities (e.g., individuals choose a workplace for the job rather than for the coworkers' characteristics, but they might make friends in that context later on). (Hassan et al., 2011)
	•	the important role played by social similarities in friendship choice is highlighted, especially when considering the “proximity principle,”. (Hassan et al., 2011)
	•	friendship choice is also dependent on characteristics that are socially constructed. Consequently, it is not surprising that friendship groups tend toward social homogeneity. (Hassan et al., 2011)
	•	McPherson et al. remind us that classical Western thought already noticed this pattern in friendship dynamics: Aristotle pointed out in his Rhetoric and Nicomachean Ethics that people “love those who are like themselves” and Plato observed in his Phaedrus that “similarity begets friendship”. (Hassan et al., 2011)
	•	friendship is vague or blurry categories, because they do not have clear edges. (Hassan et al., 2011)
	•	The friendship process is conceived as a search for compatible associates, in terms of the proximity principle, and where strangers are transformed to acquaintances and acquaintances to friends as a continuous process over time. (Hassan et al., 2011)
	•	the friendship evolution function already deals with similarity, and if a neighbour is not similar at all, it will never be more than an acquaintance. (Hassan et al., 2011)
Frustration
	•	Frustration is a sign that you are making progress as your mind becomes aware of higher levels of skill that you have yet to attain. (Greene, 2018)
G
Game theory
Evolutionnary game theory
	•	Evolutionary game theory makes use of the tree structure of games to study the ways in which agents can modify their strategies as they interact with other agents playing the same game.  (Holland, 2014)
Gap
Explanatory gap
	•	the explanatory gap is unbridgeable and that the proper conclusion to draw from it is that there is a corresponding gap in the world. (Tye, 1999)
	•	the explanatory gap may one day be bridged but we currently lack the concepts to bring the subjective and objective perspectives together. (Tye, 1999)
	•	The expression "explanatory gap" was coined by Joseph Levine (1983). A referee for Mind notes that the first philosopher to have used the term "gap" in connection with consciousness was Du Bois-Reymond (1885-7). (Tye, 1999)
	•	the so-called "explanatory gap" derives largely from a failure to recognize the special features of phenomenal concepts. (Tye, 1999)
Gap analysis
Target-Threat gap analysis
	•	[…] we should identify a real threat (or imagine a real hazard as an activated threat) and compare our defensive capacity against the threat’s offensive capacity. This sort of assessment if often termed a gap analysis since it looks for a gap between our defensive capacity and the threat’s offensive capacity. (Newsome, 2013)
Target-Standard gap analysis
	•	we usually measure our vulnerability to some standardized notional threats, such as chemical explosive weapons of a certain type or size. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Often vulnerability is judged subjectively, rather than measured objectively. (Newsome, 2013)
Gap assessment
	•	A gap assessment is the comparison between what exists within a corporation and what is required. (Landoll, 2011)
	•	These assessments compare the existence of security policies, procedures, and mechanisms, along with activities (which may include a security risk assessment), against the required security policies, procedures, mechanisms, and activities dictated in the HIPAA regulation or in the ISO 27001/2 guidelines. (Landoll, 2011)
	•	A gap assessment is performed at the beginning of the organization’s compli- ance pursuit with a standard or regulation. (Landoll, 2011)
	•	Since the gap assessment will result in a list of “gaps” or things that need to be done prior to declaring compliance, these assessments do not require veri cation of findings. (Landoll, 2011)
	•	An efficient gap assessment helps them get a quicker start. The organization being assessed should realize that deceiving the gap assessment team will only result in an inaccurate compliance plan. (Landoll, 2011)
Geist
	•	Geist, loosely transalted, means ‘spirit’ though it can refer to the mind as well as the intellectual and cultural landscape of our existence. (Coker, 2009)
Gender
Gender role
	•	For centuries, and still to this day, gender roles represent the most powerful convention of all. What men and women can do or say has been highly controlled, to the point where it seems almost to represent biological differences instead of social conventions. Women in particular are socialized to be extra nice and agreeable. They feel continual pressure to adhere to this and mistake it for something natural and biological. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Some of the most influential women in history were those who deliberately broke with these codes—performers like Marlene Dietrich and Josephine Baker, political figures such as Eleanor Roosevelt, businesswomen such as Coco Chanel. They brought out their Shadow and showed it by acting in ways that were traditionally thought of as masculine, blending and confusing gender roles. (Greene, 2018)
	•	We are all born as complete beings, with many sides to us. We have qualities of the opposite sex, both genetically and from the influence of the parent of the other gender. Our character has natural depths and dimensions to it. When it comes to boys, studies have shown that an early age they are actually more emotionally reactive than girls. They have high degrees of empathy and sensitivity. Girls have an adventurous and exploratory spirit that is natural to them. They have powerful wills, which they like to exert in transforming their environment. (Greene, 2018)
	•	As we get older, however, we have to present to the world a consistent identity. We have to play certain roles and live up to certain expectations. We have to trim and lop off natural qualities. Boys lose their rich range of emotions and, in the struggle to get ahead, repress their natural empathy. Girls have to sacrifice their assertive sides. They are supposed to be nice, smiling, deferential, always considering other people’s feelings before their own. A woman can be a boss, but she must be tender and pliant, never too aggressive.In this process, we become less and less dimensional; we conform to the expected roles of our culture and time period. We lose valuable and rich parts to our character. Sometimes we can realize this only when we encounter those who are less repressed and we feel fascination with them. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Your task is to let go of the rigidity that takes hold of you as you overidentify with the expected gender role. Power lies in exploring that middle range between the masculine and the feminine, in playing against people’s expectations. Return to the harder or softer sides of your character that you have lost or repressed. In relating to people, expand your repertoire by developing greater empathy, or by learning to be less deferential. When confronting a problem or resistance from others, train yourself to respond in different ways—attacking when you normally defend, or vice versa. In your thinking, learn to blend the analytical with the intuitive in order to become more creative (see the final section of this chapter for more on this). (Greene, 2018)
	•	when it comes to gender roles, we like to imagine a continual line of progress leading to perfect equality, and to believe that we are not far from reaching this ideal. But this is hardly the truth. Although on one level we can see definite progress, on another level, one that is deeper, we can see increasing tension and polarization between the sexes, as if the old patterns of inequality between men and women exert an unconscious influence upon us. (Greene, 2018)
	•	This tension can sometimes feel like a war, and it stems from a growing psychological distance between the genders, in which people of the opposite sex seem like alien creatures, with habits and patterns of behavior we cannot begin to fathom. This distance can turn into hostility among some. (Greene, 2018)
	•	The male sense of masculinity often has a defensive edge that reveals underlying insecurities. Such insecurity has only become more acute with shifting gender roles, and it increases the suspiciousness and hostility between men and women. (Greene, 2018)
	•	This outer conflict between the genders, however, is merely a reflection of an unresolved inner conflict. As long as the inner feminine or masculine is denied, the outer distance will only grow. When we bridge this distance from within, our attitude toward the opposite sex changes as well. We feel a deeper connection. We can talk and relate to them as if relating to parts of ourselves. The polarity between the sexes still exists and still causes us to be attracted and fall in love, but now it includes the desire to get closer to the feminine or the masculine. This is much different from the polarization between the genders, in which distance and hostility eventually come to the fore in the relationship and push people further away. The inner connection will vastly improve the outer connection and should be the ideal we aim for. (Greene, 2018)
	•	For millennia, it has been men who largely defined masculine and feminine roles and who imposed value judgments on them. Feminine styles of thinking were associated with irrationality, and feminine ways of acting seen as weak and inferior. We may have outwardly progressed in terms of inequality between the genders, but inwardly these judgments still have profound roots in us. The masculine style of thinking is still esteemed as superior, and femininity is still experienced as soft and weak. Many women have internalized these judgments. They feel that being equal means being able to be as tough and aggressive as men. But what is truly needed in the modern world is to see the masculine and the feminine as completely equal in potential reasoning power and strength of action, but in different ways. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Let us say there are feminine and masculine styles when it comes to thinking, taking action, learning from experience, and relating to other people. These styles have been reflected in the behavior of men and women for thousands of years. Some are related to physiological differences, some stem mostly from culture. Certainly there are men who have more feminine styles and women more masculine styles, but almost all of us are imbalanced to one side or the other. Our task is to open ourselves up to the opposite. We have only our rigidity to lose. (Greene, 2018)
Masculine thinking
	•	The masculine style of thinking is still esteemed as superior, and femininity is still experienced as soft and weak. Many women have internalized these judgments. They feel that being equal means being able to be as tough and aggressive as men. (Greene, 2018) 
	•	Masculine thinking tends toward focusing on what separates phenomena from one another and categorizing them. It looks for contrasts between things to better label them. It wants to take things apart, like a machine, and analyze the separate parts that go into the whole. Its thought process is linear, figuring out the sequence of steps that goes into an event. It prefers to look at things from the outside, with emotional detachment. The masculine way of thinking tends to prefer specialization, to dig deepinto something specific. It feels pleasure in uncovering the order in phenomena. It likes to build elaborate structures, whether in a book or a business. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Almost all people will lean more toward one style of thinking. What you want for yourself is to create balance by leaning more in the other direction. If you are more on the masculine side, you want to widen the fields you look at, finding connections between different forms of knowledge. In looking for solutions, you want to consider more possibilities, give greater time to the deliberative process, and allow for freer associations. You need to take seriously the intuitions that come to you after much deliberation, and not discount the value of emotions in thinking. Without a sense of excitement and inspiration, your thinking can become stale and lifeless. (Greene, 2018)
	•	When it comes to taking action, the masculine tendency is to move forward, explore the situation, attack, and vanquish. If there are obstacles in the way, it will try to push through them, this desire aptly expressed by the ancient military leader Hannibal—“I will either find a way or make a way.” It derives pleasure from staying on the offensive and taking risks. It prefers to maintain its independence and room to maneuver. (Greene, 2018)
	•	For those with the aggressive, masculine inclination, balance would come from training yourself to step back before taking any action. Consider the possibility that it is better to wait and see how things play out, or even to not respond at all. Taking action without proper consideration reveals weakness and a lack of self-control. For balance, always try to consider the interdependent relationships you are involved in and how each group or individual will be affected by any action. If you find yourself blocked in your career later in life, you must learn the power of withdrawing and reflecting on who you are, your needs, your strengths and weaknesses, your true interests before making any important decisions. This could require weeks or months of introspection. Some of the greatest leaders in history honed their best ideas while in prison. As the French would say, reculer pour mieux sauter (“step back in order to leap forward”). (Greene, 2018)
	•	As studies have shown, when men make mistakes they tend to look outward and find other people or circumstances to blame. Men’s sense of self is deeply tied to their success, and they do not like to look inward if they fail. This makes it difficult to learn from failures. On the other hand, men will tend to feel that they are completely responsible for any success in life. This will make them blind to the element of luck and the help of others, which will feed their grandiose tendencies (see chapter 11 for more on this). Similarly, if there is a problem, the masculine style is to try to figure it out on one’s own—to ask for assistance would be an admission of weakness. In general, men will overestimate their abilities and display confidence in their skills that are often not warranted by circumstances. (Greene, 2018)
	•	For those with the masculine style, when it comes to learning and improving yourself, it is best to reverse the order—to look inward when you make mistakes and to look outward when you have success. You will be able to benefit from experience by dropping the feeling that your ego is so tied to the success of each action or decision you make. Develop this reversal as a habit. Don’t be afraid of asking for help or feedback; instead, make this a habit as well. Weakness comes from the inability to ask questions and to learn. Lower your self-opinion. You are not as great or skilled as you imagine. This will spur you to actually improve yourself. (Greene, 2018)
	•	As with male chimpanzees, in a group setting the masculine style is to require a leader, and to either aspire to that role or gain power by being the most loyal follower. Leaders will designate various deputies to do their bidding. Men form hierarchies and punish those who fall out of line. They are highly status conscious, hyperaware of their place in the group. Leaders will tend to use some element of fear to keep the group cohesive. The masculine style of leadership is to identify clear goals and reach them. It puts emphasis on results, however they are achieved. (Greene, 2018)
	•	For those with the masculine style, it is important to enlarge your concept of leadership. When you think more deeply about the individuals on the team and strategize to involve them more, you can have superior results, engaging the energy and creativity of the group. Studies have shown that boys are as empathetic as girls, highly attuned, for instance, to the emotions of the mother. But empathy is slowly drummed out of men as they come to develop their assertive style. Some of the greatest male leaders in history, however, managed to retain and develop their empathy. A leader such as Sir Ernest HenryShackleton (see chapter 2) was no less of a man for his constant consideration of the emotions of each of the men he was responsible for—he was simply a stronger and more effective leader. The same could be said of Abraham Lincoln. (Greene, 2018)
Feminine thinking
	•	Feminine styles of thinking were associated with irrationality, and feminine ways of acting seen as weak and inferior. We may have outwardly progressed in terms of inequality between the genders, but inwardly these judgments still have profound roots in us. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Feminine thinking orients itself differently. It likes to focus on the whole, how the parts connect to one another, the overall gestalt. In looking at a group of people, it wants to see how they relate to one another. Instead of freezing phenomena in time in order to examine them, it focuses on the organic process itself, how one thing grows into another. In trying to solve a puzzle, the feminine style will prefer to meditate on several aspects, absorb the patterns, and let answers or solutions come to the individual over time, as if they needed to be cooked. This form of thinking leads to insights when the hidden connections between things suddenly become visible in intuitive flashes. As opposed to specialization, it is more interested in how different fields or forms of knowledge can connect to one another. In studying another culture, for instance, it will want to get closer to it, to understand how it is experienced from within. It is more sensitive to information from the senses, not merely from abstract reasoning. (Greene, 2018)
	•	If you lean more in the feminine direction, you need to be capable of focusing and digging into specific problems, tamping down the impulse to widen your search and multitask. You have to find pleasure in boring into one aspect of a problem. Reconstructing a causal chain and continually refining it will give depth to your thinking. You tend to see structure and order as dull affairs, giving greater emphasis to expressing an idea and feeling inspired by it. Instead, you need to derive pleasure in paying deep attention to the structure of a book, argument, or project. Being creative and clear with the structure will give your material its power to influence people. Sometimes you need to gain greater emotional distance to understand a problem, and you must force yourself to do so. (Greene, 2018)
	•	When confronted with a problem or the need to take action, the feminine style often prefers to first withdraw from the immediate situation and contemplate more deeply the options. It will often look for ways to avoid the conflict, to smooth out relations, to win without having to go to battle. Sometimes the best action is nonaction—let the dynamic play itself out to understand it better; let the enemy hang itself by its aggressive actions. (Greene, 2018)
	•	In the West, this feminine style of strategizing and acting is instinctively judged as weak and timid. But in other cultures the style is viewed quite differently. To Chinese strategists, wu-wei, or nonaction, is often the height of wisdom and aggressive action a sign of stupidity because it narrows one’s options. There is in fact tremendous strength contained within the feminine style—patience, resilience, and flexibility. To the great samurai warrior Miyamoto Musashi, the ability to stand back and wait, to let the opponent tire himself out mentally before counterattacking, was critical for success. (Greene, 2018)
	•	For those with the feminine style, it is best to accustom yourself to various degrees of conflict and confrontation, so that any avoidance of it is strategic and not out of fear. This requires baby steps, confronting people in small ways in everyday situations before handling larger conflicts. Drop the need to always consider the other side’s feelings; sometimes there are bad people who need to be thwarted, and being empathetic only empowers them. You need to be comfortable saying no and turning people down. Sometimes when you try to smooththings out, it is not out of empathy or strategy but out of an aversion to displeasing people. You have been trained to be deferential, and you need to get rid of this impulse. You need to reconnect to the bold and adventurous spirit you once had and widen your strategic options to both offense and defense. Sometimes you can overthink things and come up with too many options. Action for its own sake can be therapeutic, and taking aggressive action can discomfit your opponents. (Greene, 2018)
	•	For women, it is the opposite: When there is failure, they tend to blame themselves and look inward. If there is success, they are more prone to look at the role of others in helping them. They find it easy to ask for assistance; they do not see this as a sign of personal inadequacy. They tend to underestimate their skills and are less prone to the grandiose confidence that often fuels men. (Greene, 2018)
	•	For those with the feminine style, it is easy to beat yourself up after failures or mistakes. The introspection can go too far. The same can be said of ascribing success to others. Women more than men will suffer from low self-esteem, which is not natural but acquired. They often have internalized critical voices from others. Jung called these animus voices: all the men over the years who have judged women for their looks and intelligence. You want to catch these voices as they occur and rid yourself of them. Because failures or criticisms might affect you too deeply, you can become afraid to try something again, which narrows your learning possibilities. You need to adopt more of the masculine self-confidence, without the attendant stupidity. In your daily encounters, try to drop or minimize your emotional responses to events and see them from a greater distance. You are training yourself to not take things so personally. (Greene, 2018)
	•	The feminine style is more about maintaining the group spirit and keeping the relationships smoothed out, with fewer differences among individuals. It is more empathetic, considering the feelings of each member and trying to involve them more in the decision-making process. Results are important, but the way they are achieved, the process, is equally important. (Greene, 2018)
	•	For those of the feminine style, you must not be afraid of assuming a strong leadership role, particularly in times of crisis. Considering the feelings of everyone and incorporating the ideas of too many will weaken you and your plans. Although women are certainly better listeners, sometimes it is best to know when to stop listening and go with the plan you have opted for. Once you recognize the fools, the incompetents, and the hyperselfish in the group, it is best to fire them and to even find pleasure in getting rid of those who bring the whole group down. Instilling a touch of fear in your lieutenants is not always a bad thing. (Greene, 2018)
General average
	•	[…] the concept of general average, which called for all parties to share proportionately in any loss suffered during a venture. (Covello and Mumpower, 1986)
	•	This device established a mechanism for risk sharing, and provided a foundation for the first insurance exchange that developed and flourished in Athens. (Covello and Mumpower, 1986)
Generation
	•	You are born into a generation that defines who you are more than you can imagine. Your generation wants to separate itself from the previous one and set a new tone for the world. In the process, it forms certain tastes, values, and ways of thinking that you as an individual internalize. As you get older, these generational values and ideas tend to close you off from other points of view, constraining your mind. (Greene, 2018)
	•	First and foremost, you must be able to feel the change in the collective mood, to sense how people are diverging from the past. Once you feel the spirit, you can begin to analyze what is behind it. Why are people dissatisfied, and what are they really craving? Why are they gravitating toward these new styles? Look at those idols from the past that no longer cast a spell, that seem ridiculous, that are the subject of mockery, particularly among the young. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Think of yourself as an enemy of the status quo, whose proponents must view you in turn as dangerous. (Greene, 2018)
Generational pattern
	•	Although this pattern certainly has variations and is not a science, we tend to see a lot of the overall sequencing in history. (Greene, 2018)
	•	At the core of this pattern is a continual back-and-forth rhythm that comes from emerging generations reacting against the imbalances and mistakes of the previous generation. If we go back four generations in our own time we can clearly see this. We start with the silent generation. As children experiencing the Great Depression and as adults coming of age during World War II and the postwar period, theybecame rather cautious and conservative, valuing stability, material comforts, and fitting tightly into the group. The next generation, the baby boomers, found the conformity of their parents rather stifling. Emerging in the 1960s, and not haunted by the harsh financial realities of their parents, this generation valued personal expression, having adventures, and being idealistic.This was followed by Generation X, which was marked by the chaos of the 1960s and the ensuing social and political scandals. Coming of age in the 1980s and 1990s, it was pragmatic and confrontational, valuing individualism and self-reliance. This generation reacted against the hypocrisies and impracticalities in their parents’ idealism. This was followed by the millennial generation. Traumatized by terrorism and a financial crisis, they reacted against the individualism of the last generation, craving security and teamwork, with a noted dislike of conflict and confrontation. (Greene, 2018)
	•	this back-and-forth pattern has a salutary effect. If one generation simply carried forward the tendencies of the previous one, we would probably have destroyed ourselves long ago. Imagine generations that succeeded the wildness of the 1920s or the 1960s bycontinuing with this spirit, and going further with it; or a generation that succeeded the 1950s by remaining equally conservative and conformist. We would suffocate ourselves with too much self- expression or stagnation. The pattern may lead to imbalances, but it also ensures that we revitalize ourselves.Sometimes the changes that are generated in a revolutionary period are rather trivial and do not last past the cycle. But sometimes, from a strong crisis, a revolution forges something new that lasts for centuries and represents progress toward values that are more rational and empathetic. In seeing this historical pattern, we must recognize what seems to be an overall human spirit that transcends any particular time and that keeps us evolving. If for any reason the cycle stopped, we would be doomed. (Greene, 2018)
First generation
	•	The first generation is that of the revolutionaries who make a radical break with the past, establishing new values but also creating some chaos in the struggle to do so. Often in this generation there are some great leaders or prophets who influence the direction of the revolution and leave their stamp on it. (Greene, 2018)
Second generation
	•	Then along comes a second generation that craves some order. They are still feeling the heat of the revolution itself, having lived through it at a very early age, but they want to stabilize the world, establish some conventions and dogma. (Greene, 2018)
Third generation
	•	Those of the third generation—having little direct connection to the founders of the revolution—feel less passionate about it. They are pragmatists. They want to solve problems and make life as comfortable as possible. They are not so interested in ideas but rather in building things. In the process, they tend to drain out the spirit of the original revolution. Material concerns predominate, and people can become quite individualistic. (Greene, 2018)
Fourth generation 
	•	Along comes the fourth generation, which feels that society has lost its vitality, but they are not sure what should replace it. They begin to question the values they have inherited, some becoming quite cynical. Nobody knows what to believe in anymore. A crisis of sorts emerges. Then comes the revolutionary generation, which, unified around some new belief, finally tears down the old order, and the cycle continues.This revolution can be extreme and violent, or it can be less intense, with simply the emergence of new and different values. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Although this pattern certainly has variations and is not a science, we tend to see a lot of the overall sequencing in history. Most notable of all is the emergence of the fourth generation and the crisis in values that comes with it. This period is often the most painful to live through —we humans feel a deep need to believe in something, and when we begin to doubt and question the old order and sense a vacuum in our values, we can go a little mad. We tend to latch onto the latest belief systems peddled by the charlatans and demagogues who thrive in such periods. We look for scapegoats for all the problems that now arise and the spreading dissatisfaction. Without a unifying belief to anchor and calm us, we become tribal, relying on some small affinity group to give us a feeling of belonging. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Often, in a crisis period, we will notice the forming of a subgroup among those who feel particularly anxious and resentful at the breakdown of order. They are often people who felt somewhat privileged in the past, and the chaos and coming change threatens what they have taken for granted. They want to hold on to the past, return to some golden age they can vaguely remember, and prevent any coming revolution. They are doomed, because the cycle cannot be stopped, and the past cannot be magically brought back to life. But as this crisis period fades and begins to merge into the revolutionary period, we often detect rising levels of excitement, as those who are young and particularly hungry for something new can sense the changes coming that they have set up in their own way. (Greene, 2018)
	•	It seems that we are living through such a crisis period, with a generation that is experiencing it in its key phase in life. Although we cannot see how close we might be to the end of this period, such times never last too long, because the human spirit will not tolerate them. Some unifying belief system is in gestation, and some new values are being generated that we cannot yet see. (Greene, 2018)
Generation fight
	•	The fight between generations is always ripe material for this. What you offer is in bold contrast to the stodgy previous generation. (Greene, 2018)
Generation mindset
	•	The generational mind-set inevitably dominates everyone from within, no matter how they personally try to react against it. We cannot step outside the historical moment that we are born into. (Greene, 2018)
	•	In considering this mind-set, we must try to think in terms of a collective personality, or what we shall call spirit. Our generation has inherited from our parents and the past certain key values and ways of looking at the world that remain unquestioned. But at any moment, people of a new generation are searching for something more alive and relevant, something that expresses what is different, what is altering in the present. This sense of what is moving and evolving in the present, as opposed to what is inherited from the past, is the collective spirit itself, its restless and searching nature. It is not something we can easily put into words. It is more a mood, an emotional tone, a way that people relate to one another.That is why we can often best associate the generational spirit with its dominant musical style, or an artistic trend for a certain type of imagery, or a mood captured in the literature or films of thatgeneration. For instance, nothing better captures the wild spirit and frenetic pace of the 1920s than the jazz of the period and the brassy sound of the saxophone, which was the new rage.This spirit will tend to alter as our generation passes through the various phases of life. How we collectively relate to the world will not be the same in our fifties as it was in our twenties. Circumstances, historical events, and the aging process will modify this spirit. But, as with any individual, there is something in the generational personality that remains intact and transcends the passing years. (Greene, 2018)

	•	If our generation has a particular spirit to it, we could say the same for the time period that we are living through, which generally comprises four generations alive at the same time. The blending of these generations, the tension among them, and the clashing that often occurs create what we shall call the overall spirit of the times or what is commonly known as the zeitgeist. For instance, when it comes to the 1960s, we cannot separate the mood of the powerful youth culture of that period from the antagonism and dismay it stirred among those who were older. The dynamic and spirit of those times came from the dramatic interaction of two clashing perspectives. (Greene, 2018)
	•	What you want to do is to be able to gauge the spirit of the present moment, with a similar sense of distance, and to see where your generation fits into the overall scheme of history, giving you a sense of where things might be headed. (Greene, 2018)
	•	create a kind of personality profile of your generation, so that you can understand its spirit in the present and exploit it. Keep in mind that there are always nuances and exceptions. What you are looking for is common traits that signal an overall spirit. (Greene, 2018)
	•	In looking at this shadow side of your generation, keep in mind that its tendency toward one extreme—materialism, spirituality, adventure, safety—conceals a hidden attraction to the opposite. (Greene, 2018)
	•	your generational perspective tends to create a particular kind of myopia. Each generation tends toward some imbalance as it reacts against the previous one. It views and judges everything according to certain values that it holds over others and this closes the mind to other possibilities. We can be both idealistic and pragmatic, value teamwork and our own individual spirit, et cetera. There is much to be gained by looking at the world from the perspective of your parents or your children, and even adopting some of their values. Feeling that your generation is superior is simply an illusion. Your awareness will free you from these mental blocks and illusions, making your mind more fluid and creative. You will be able to shape your own values and ideas and not be such a product of the times. (Greene, 2018)
	•	With your awareness of the overall zeitgeist, you will also understand the historical context. You will have a sense of where the world is headed. You can anticipate what is around the corner. With such knowledge, you can bring your own individual spirit into play and help shape this future that is gestating in the present.And feeling deeply connected to the unbroken chain of history, and your role in this grand historical drama, will infuse you with a calmness that will make everything in life more bearable. You do not overreact at the outrage of the day. You do not go gaga over the latest trend. You are aware of the pattern that will tend to swing things in a different direction within a period of time. If you feel out of harmony with the times, you know that the bad days will end and you can play your part in making the next wave happen. (Greene, 2018)
	•	To make the most of the zeitgeist, you must begin with a simple premise: you are a product of the times as much as anyone; the generation you were born into has shaped your thoughts and values, whether you are aware of this or not. (Greene, 2018)
Generational awareness
	•	this generational phenomenon can yield several other benefits: We can see what forces shaped our parents’ mind-set, and then ours in turn, as we have tried to go in a different direction. We can make better sense of the underlying changes going on in all areas of society and begin to surmise where the world is headed, to anticipate future trends, and to understand the role we can play in shaping events. This can not only bring us great social power but can also have a therapeutic, calming effect on us as we view events in the world with some distance and equanimity, elevated above the chaotic changes of the moment.We shall call this knowledge generational awareness. To attain it, first we must understand the actual profound effect that our generation has on how we view the world, and second we must understand the larger generational patterns that shape history and recognize where our time period fits into the overall scheme. (Greene, 2018)
	•	you must alter your attitude toward your own generation. We like to imagine that we are autonomous and that our values and ideas come from within, not without, but this is in fact not the case. Your goal is to understand as deeply as possible how profoundly the spirit of your generation, and the times that you live in, have influenced how you perceive the world. (Greene, 2018)
Generational change
	•	hat drives these changes is the continual succession of new generations of young people, who are trying to create something more relevant to their experience of the world, something that reflects more their values and spirit and that goes in a different direction from that of the previous generation. (We can generally describe a generation as comprising around twenty-two years, with those born at the earliest and latest parts of that period often identifying more with the previous or succeeding generation.)And this pattern of change from one generation to the next is itself part of a larger pattern in history, going back thousands of years, in which particular reactions and shifts in values recur rather regularly, all of which suggests something about human nature that transcends us as individuals, that has programmed us to repeat these patterns for some reason. (Greene, 2018)
Generational culture
	•	when we reach our twenties and into our thirties, we enter a new phase of life and experience a shift. Now we are in a position toassume some power, to actually alter this world according to our own values and ideals. As we progress in our work, we begin to influence the culture and its politics. We inevitably clash with the older generation that has held power for some time, as they insist on their own way of acting and evaluating events. Many of them often view us as immature, unsophisticated, soft, undisciplined, pampered, unenlightened, and certainly not ready to assume power.In some periods, the youth culture that is generated is so strong that it comes to dominate the culture at large—in the 1920s and the 1960s, for instance. In other periods, the older generation in positions of leadership is much more dominant, and the influence of the emerging adults in their twenties is less noticeable. In any event, to a greater or lesser degree, a struggle and clash occurs between these two generations and their perspectives. (Greene, 2018)
Generational event
	•	Try to map out the ramifications of these decisive events. Pay particular attention to the effect they may have had on the pattern of socialization that will characterize your generation. If the event was a major crisis of some sort, that will tend to make those of your generation band together for comfort and security, valuing the team and feelings of love, and allergic to confrontation. A period of stability and nonevents will make you gravitate toward others for adventure, for group experimentation, sometimes bordering on the reckless. In general, you will tend to notice a socializing style of your peers, most evident in your twenties. Search for the roots of this.These larger events will have an effect on how you view success and money and whether you value status and wealth or less material values such as creativity and personal expression. (Greene, 2018)
Generational icon
	•	Pay close attention to the heroes and icons of a generation, those who act out the qualities that others secretly wish they had as well. They are often the types who gain celebrity in youth culture—therebels, the successful entrepreneurs, the gurus, the activists. These indicate emerging new values. (Greene, 2018)
Generational judgement
	•	as we enter our forties and midlife and assume many of the leadership positions in society, we begin to take notice of a younger generation that is fighting for its own power and position. Its members are now judging us and finding our own style and ideas rather irrelevant. We begin to judge them in return, describing them as immature, unsophisticated, soft, et cetera. We might begin to entertain the notion that the world is heading downhill fast, the values we found so important no longer mattering to this youthful set.When we judge in this way, we are not aware that we are reacting according to a pattern that has existed for at least three thousand years. (There is an inscription on a Babylonian clay tablet that dates from around 1000 BC that reads, “Today’s youth is rotten, evil, godless and lazy. It will never be what youth used to be, and it will never be able to preserve our culture.” We find similar complaints in all cultures and in all time periods.) We think we are judging the younger generation in an objective manner, but we are merely succumbing to an illusion of perspective. It is also true that we are probably experiencing some hidden envy of their youth and mourning the loss of our own. (Greene, 2018)
Generational myopia 
	•	your generational perspective tends to create a particular kind of myopia. Each generation tends toward some imbalance as it reacts against the previous one. It views and judges everything according to certain values that it holds over others and this closes the mind to other possibilities. We can be both idealistic and pragmatic, value teamwork and our own individual spirit, et cetera. There is much to be gained by looking at the world from the perspective of your parents or your children, and even adopting some of their values. Feeling that your generation is superior is simply an illusion. Your awareness will free you from these mental blocks and illusions, making your mind more fluid and creative. You will be able to shape your own values and ideas and not be such a product of the times. (Greene, 2018)
Generational perspective
	•	In this first phase of life, we shape a generational perspective. It is a kind of collective mind-set, as we absorb the prevailing culture at the same time as our peers, from the point of view of childhood and youth. And because we are too young to understand or analyze this perspective, we are generally ignorant of its formation and how it influences what we see and how we interpret events. (Greene, 2018)
Generational struggle
	•	When it comes to the changes generated by the tensions between two generations, we can say that the greater part of them will come from the young. They are more restless, in search of their own identity, and more attuned to the group and how they fit in. By the time such a younger generation emerges into their thirties and forties, they willhave shaped the world with their changes and given it a look and feel that is distinct from their parents. (Greene, 2018)
	•	If our generation has a particular spirit to it, we could say the same for the time period that we are living through, which generally comprises four generations alive at the same time. The blending of these generations, the tension among them, and the clashing that often occurs create what we shall call the overall spirit of the times or what is commonly known as the zeitgeist. For instance, when it comes to the 1960s, we cannot separate the mood of the powerful youth culture of that period from the antagonism and dismay it stirred among those who were older. The dynamic and spirit of those times came from the dramatic interaction of two clashing perspectives. (Greene, 2018)
Generational variation
	•	When looking at any generation, we naturally see variations within it. We find individuals who are more aggressive than others—they tend to be leaders, the ones who sense the styles and trends of the time and express them first. They have less fear about breaking with the past and defying the older generation. Danton exemplifies this type. We also find a much larger group of followers who are not so aggressive, who find it more exciting to keep up with trends, helping to shape and promote them. And finally, we also find the rebels, those types who defy their own generation and define themselves by going against the grain. This could include the beatniks of the 1950s or those young people in the 1960s who gravitated toward conservative politics. (Greene, 2018)
Generational rebel
	•	We can say of these rebel types that they are just as marked by their generation as anyone, but in reverse. And in fact, much of the same spirit of the generation can be detected underneath this reverse version —for instance, those younger people in the 1780s who rallied around the aristocracy and in defense of the monarchy often felt a very romanticized love of the old order; the young conservatives of the 1960s were just as preachy, fanatic, and idealistic in their reverse values as the majority. The generational mind-set inevitably dominates everyone from within, no matter how they personally try to react against it. We cannot step outside the historical moment that we are born into. (Greene, 2018)
Generosity
	•	When we feel generous toward others, they feel drawn to us and want to match our spirit. When we feel generous toward ourselves, we no longer feel the need to bow and scrape and play the game of false humility while secretly resenting our lack of success. (Greene, 2018)
	•	From this more neutral stance, you can then try to understand the people you deal with on a deeper level, as Chekhov did with his father. The more you do this, the more tolerant you will tend to become toward people and toward human nature in general. Your open, generous spirit will make your social interactions much smoother, and people will be drawn to you. (Greene, 2018)
Generous people
	•	Les hommes vraiment généreux sont toujours prêts à devenir compatissants, lorsque le malheur de leur ennemi dépasse les limites de leur haine. (Dumas, 1998)
Genes
	•	Genes contained in the DNA are transcribed and translated to produce proteins. Proteins play a central role in almost every aspect of life: muscle movement, blood circulation, acting as enzymes, binding to hormones, etc. Moreover, proteins interact with each other: the production of a protein can be facilitated or hindered by the presence of other proteins in the cell. The delicate balance of these reciprocal influences is crucial for life. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
	•	These interwoven patterns of activation and inhibition yield the gene regulatory network. In this net, nodes are genes and links are chains of reactions that connect the expression of a gene with that of others. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
Genetic
	•	During the eighties and nineties of the last century everything was ‘genetic’ in some way. Newspapers published stories about ‘the gene for homosexuality’, ‘the gene for obesity’, ‘the gene for violence’, or the ‘gene for alcoholism’. This attitude responded to the expectation that the secret of human complexity was hidden in the genome. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
Genius
	•	You want to retain the elasticity of spirit you had as a child, interested in everything, while retaining the hard-nosed need to verify and scrutinize for yourself all ideas and beliefs. The two can coexist. It is a balance that all geniuses possess. (Greene, 2018)
	•	l’homme qui crée renonce à la convention sociale et c’est précisément parce qu’il s’en échappe qu’il peut découvrir ce qui est destiné à être imité. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Rappelons que c’est parmi ces incompris, souvent persécutés, que se recrutent les grands fondateurs, les créateurs de croyances et d’institutions. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	pour les idées de génie des grands hommes, sommes-nous bien certains qu'elles soient exclusivement leur œuvre? Sans doute elles sont toujours créées par des esprits solitaires; mais les milliers de grains de poussière qui forment l'alluvion où ces idées ont germé, n'est-ce pas l'âme des foules qui les a formés? (Lebon, 1895)
	•	vous savez que les inventions humaines marchent du composé au simple, et que le simple est toujours la perfection. (Dumas, 1998)
Genocide
	•	Par leur étendue et leur caractère systématique, les génocides s’apparentent aux lynchages dont ils sont une aggravation par généralisation (accompagnés ou non d’émeutes populaires). Derrière les différentes formes qu’on peut distinguer — génocides de substitution, de dévastation ou d’élimination, selon la classification que propose, par exemple, H. Savon (1972) — le désir est de détruire un groupe humain de fond en comble, d’exterminer tous ses représentants. Inspiré par le même genre d’impulsion que le lynchage, le génocide va bien au-delà de la mise à mort d’un ou de quelques individus dans une démarche fortement symbolique : il est l’expression ultime et radicale du besoin collectif de détruire. De tels comportements de groupe reposent sur une exacerbation de la différence (ethnique, politique, raciale, religieuse) que les éthologues ont pu décrire sous le concept de pseudo-spéciation culturelle10 : l’écart à la norme devenant à lui seul le signal déclencheur de la violence exterminatrice. (Mannoni, 1985)
Geometry
	•	Geometry is then the study of invariants of transformation groups—features of the underlying space that are preserved by the transformations. (Stewart, 2013)
Gift
	•	when giving people gifts or rewards as a possible means of winning them over to your side, it is always best to give smaller gifts or rewards than larger ones. Large gifts make it too apparent that you are trying to buy their loyalty, which will offend people’s sense of independence. Some might accept large gifts out of need, but later they will feel resentful or suspicious. Smaller gifts have a better effect— people can tell themselves they deserve such things and are not being bought or bribed. In fact, such smaller rewards, spread out over time, will bind people to you in a much greater way than anything lavish. (Greene, 2018)
Globalization
	•	Globalization may be bringing the world together but it is also forcing it apart at the same time. (Coker, 2009)
	•	Globalization, writes the French social thinker Alain Touraine, does not define a stage of modernity; it does not even define a historical era. It should be seen for what it is: a way of managing historical change, or a way of looking at the world and solving some of its problems. (Coker, 2009)
	•	Globalization separates the social and economic; it puts paid to social visions by revealing all local action as meaningless in the face of global forces. (Coker, 2009)
	•	globalization has increased the diversity of outcomes when complex, interactive systems such as financial flows, regional economies or the international system as a whole are in flux. (US Government, 2009)

Global disorder
	•	The global disorder is non-linear and therefore not open to actuarial analysis. (Coker, 2009)
	•	A novel and officially endorsed formula now proposes that the inter- national security désordre may be resolving to one dominated not by east-west nor north–south issues but rather by issues arising from a global stratification into zones riches [rich zones], zones tampons [buffer zones] and zones misérables [poor or wretched zones]. (Gregory, 2000)  
Global powers
	•	For the global powers, the regional level is crucial in shaping both the options for, and consequences of, projecting their influences and rivalries into the rest of the system. (Buzan and Wæver, 2003)
Global security
	•	The project of global modernity, itself emerging out of an ‘indigenous’ Euro-American tradition that from the very beginning lost its monopoly on it, is in other words plural because in every local site modernity is brought into social existence in a tension-filled relationship between local concerns and global forms of dis- cursive and institutional power (Pieterse, 2000). (Bubandt, 2005)
Glory
	•	lui apprenant l'histoire des nations et des grands hommes qui laissent de temps en temps derrière eux une de ces traces lumineusesqu'on appelle la gloire. (Dumas, 1998)
	•	Laissons donc la raison aux philosophes, mais ne lui demandons pas trop d'intervenir dans le gouvernement des hommes. Ce n'est pas avec la raison et c'est le plus souvent malgré elle, que se sont créés des sentiments tels que l'honneur, l'abnégation, la foi religieuse, l'amour de la gloire et de la patrie, qui ont été jusqu'ici les grands ressorts de toutes les civilisations. (Lebon, 1895)
Goal
	•	goals are generally inferred from the effects of behavior, and the effects that are best known and often seem most important are the effects upon ourselves. (Heuer, 1999)
Long-term goals
	•	Never lose sight of your long-term goals. With an elevated perspective, you will have the patience and clarity to reach almost any objective. (Greene, 2018)
	•	when faced with issues that are important, we must have a clear sense of our long-term goals and how to attain them. Part of this involves assessing the relative strengths and weaknesses of the parties involved. Such clarity will allow us to withstand the constant emotional overreactions of those around us. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Assimilating too much information leads to mental fatigue, confusion, and feelings of helplessness. Everything begins to seem equally important—the placement of toilets and a possible war with the Turks. What you need is a mental filtering system based on a scale of priorities and your long-term goals. Knowing what you want to accomplish in the end will help you weed out the essential from the nonessential. You do not have to know all the details. Sometimes you need to delegate—let your subordinates handle the information gathering. Remember that greater control over events will come from realistic assessments of the situation, precisely what is made most difficult by a brain submerged in trivia. (Greene, 2018)
God-term
	•	When organizations are able to convince others to accept their appar- ent affinities, that is to say when organizations legitimate their sym- bolic constructions, they create what philosopher Kenneth Burke called a God-term, a term whose basic assumptions go unquestioned. (Clarke, 1999)
Goal-centered processes
	•	Goal-centered processes help to make efficient decisions which are achieved with relatively few resources. (Vari, 1995)
Goop faith
	•	Goop faith negotiations are prerequisite to consensual agreements. (Baughman, 1995)
	•	Negotiations in good faith depend in part upon the ability of each party at the table to speak with authority on behalf of those they represent. (Baughman, 1995)
Good scientific advice
	•	Good scientific advice is seen as tapping into a wide range of scientific discussions, emphasising diversity (Stilgoe et al., 2006)
Gossip
	•	If people like to gossip a lot, particularly about common acquaintances, you can be sure they will gossip about you. (Greene, 2018)
	•	In any event, serial gossipers do not make loyal and trustworthy friends. (Greene, 2018)
Governance
	•	governance across and within policy domains tended to be marked by diverse philosophies and practices towards the management of adverse outcomes (Hood et al. 2001) (Rothstein and alt., 2013:219)
	•	risk management' and `governance' are fundamentally about the design of contracts with the power to bond agents to principals. (Power, 2009)
	•	the term ‘governance’ has experienced tremendous popularity in the literature on international relations, comparative political science, policy studies, sociology of environment and technology, as well as risk research. (Renn, 2007a)
	•	On a national scale, governance describes structures and processes for collective decision making involving governmental and non-governmental actors (Nye and Donahue, 2000). (Renn, 2007a)
	•	Governing choices in modern societies is seen as an interplay between governmental institutions, economic forces and civil society actors (such as NGOs). (Renn, 2007a)
	•	At the global level, governance embodies a horizontally organized structure of functional self-regulation encompassing state and non-state actors bringing about collectively binding decisions without superior authority (Rosenau, 1992; Wolf, 2002). (Renn, 2007a)
	•	It is also useful to differentiate between ‘horizontal’ and ‘vertical’ gover- nance (Benz and Eberlein, 1999; Lyall and Tait, 2004). (Renn, 2007a)
	•	Contemporary ideas of ‘governance’ – for instance, as developed by Rhodes (1997) – focus on different interactions among multiple state and non-state actors, and portray the ‘policy network’ approach as a departure from what is claimed to be an older pattern focusing mainly on state activity and single organizations. (Hood et al., 2001)
	•	Qui connaît l'art d'impressionner l'imagination des foules connaît aussi l'art de les gouverner. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Les peuples ne sont pas gouvernés comme le voudraient leurs caprices d'un moment, mais comme l'exige leur caractère. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Le caractère des peuples et non les gouvernements conduit leurs destinées. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Une des fonctions les plus essentielles des hommes d'État consiste donc à baptiser de mots populaires, ou au moins neutres, les choses que les foules ne peuvent supporter avec leurs anciens noms. La puissance des mots est si grande qu'il suffit de désigner par des termes bien choisis les choses les plus odieuses pour les faire accepter des foules. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	L'art des gouvernants, comme celui des avocats, consiste surtout à savoir manier les mots. Une des grandes difficultés de cet art est que, dans une même société, les mêmes mots ont le plus souvent des sens fort différents pour les diverses couches sociales. Elles emploient en apparence les mêmes mots; mais elles ne parlent jamais la même langue. (Lebon, 1895)
Horizontal governance
	•	The horizontal level includes the relevant actors in decision-making processes within a defined geographical or functional segment (such as all relevant actors within a community, region, nation or continent); (Renn, 2007a)
Vertical governance
	•	the vertical level describes the links between these segments (such as the institutional relationships between the local, regional and state levels). (Renn, 2007a)
Good governance 
	•	‘good’ governance can be a source of risk itself (Rothstein et al., 2006)
	•	Good government should set a very high standard for the provision of strategic notice. (Omand, 2014)
Government
	•	Governments hate surprises. (Omand, 2014)
	•	government is different from opposition. (Omand, 2014)
	•	governments have, as a matter of course, to take action on the basis of low probabil- ity but high impact future threats. (Omand, 2014)
Government intervention
	•	Since ancient times, government authorities have directly intervened to reduce, mitigate, or control risks. (Covello and Mumpower, 1986)
	•	Virtually all of the great ancient civilizations (e.g., China, Maya, Egypt, and Mesopotamia) directly intervened to mitigate the effects of natural disasters. Historical records indicate, for example, that throughout history, governments have played a major role in developing and financing elaborate systems of flood control, including dams, dikes, and canals. (Covello and Mumpower, 1986)
	•	(Omand, 2014)
	•	Government has the responsibility to safeguard the public and protect national interests, and given the power of intelligence to improve decision- taking it would be a dereliction for government not to steer the intel- ligence community with a set of its priorities. (Omand, 2014)
	•	Government also has to have a care to value for public money and thus to help ensure that scarce intelligence resource is deployed where it can make most difference. (Omand, 2014)
Prudent government
	•	Prudent government would however recognize another truth, and that is that it is in human nature not to want to admit policy upset and to resist being told unwelcome news. (Omand, 2014)
Wise government
	•	wise government will ensure that its intelligence community understands that it has an obligation to direct on its own authority sufficient of its resource to be able to give government adequate warning of trouble brewing, especially where government would not otherwise see it coming in time. (Omand, 2014)
Bad government
	•	bad government flows principally from the fear that comes from exercise of arbitrary power. (Omand, 2014)
Good government
	•	good government is flanked by the figure of Prudence. In Renaissance iconography, Prudentia is shown as having three faces illustrating the arts of memoria (past), intelligentia (present) and providentia (future). (Omand, 2014)
Grammar
	•	Grammar is difficult for those who already knows a language because meaning and function are fused and seem indivisible. (Coker, 2009)
Formal grammar
	•	There is a suggestive precedent in language studies: the universal grammar (UG) formalism, introduced by Noam Chomsky. A formal grammar à la Chomsky involves a set of generators (e.g. a vocabulary), and a set of operators for combining the generators into meaningful strings (e.g. sentences). The purpose of a formal grammar is to generate a corpus (set) that describes the states (sentences) that can occur under the grammar’s rules.  (Holland, 2014)
	•	the order in which an element is generated by the grammar (the placement of a word in a sentence) is explicitly attached to that element (in a subject–verb–object grammar, a verb is ordinarily placed after a subject noun. In a broader context, the order of generation of elements in the corpus plays the role of time. The effect is much like setting up and executing a computer program, where the generators are the instruction set and the corpus is the result of executing the program. (Holland, 2014)
	•	Generative processes suggest formal grammars (see Chapter 1) as a starting point for an overarching theory. Recall that a formal grammar involves two basic parts: an alphabet (letters or elements) and a set of operators (that are applied to letters and strings of letters to produce new strings). (Holland, 2014)
Grammar of risk
	•	When objects of concern are described in terms of risk, they are placed in a web of expectations about management and act or responsibility. The apparent risk-based description of organizational life and personal life corresponds to widespread expectation that organizations must be seen to act as if the management of risk is possible. (Power, 2009)
Grammar of war
	•	The grammar of war is different today from the one with which we were most familiar during the Cold War. (Coker, 2009)
	•	This ‘grammar’ that is constraining the political logic of the defence effort includes the strategic, operational and tactical interaction with an opposing adservary. It also includes more mundane, but equally real, constaints of limited financial, technological and other resources. (Frühling, 2014)
Grammatical rule
	•	The operators in a generated system determine which combinations of generators are legitimate, just as grammatical rules determine legitimate sentences in a language. (Holland, 2014)
	•	Grammatical rules determine the meaningful orderings of words within a language, thereby defining the corpus for the language. (Holland, 2014)
	•	Once the appropriate operators are chosen, we can make precise comparisons between corresponding grammars, physical models, and generated systems. (Holland, 2014)
Generative Grammar
	•	The most fundamental tenet of Generative Grammar is that there is a level of linguistic description, namely, syntax, that is independent of all other levels of linguistic description including semantics and independent of all other aspects of cognition as well. (Tomasello, 1998)
	•	This Autonomy of Syntax thesis is not an empirical discovery or even a hypothesis that is ever explicitly tested. It is a paradigm-defining definitional postulate that is a direct result of taking a mathematical approach to natural language. (Tomasello, 1998)
	•	Generative Grammar is nothing other than a form of mathematics, and thus it has been applied not just to language but also to music (Jackendoff, 1983), to genetics (Collado-Vides, 1991), and to dreaming (Foulkes, 1978). (Tomasello, 1998)
	•	The goal of Generative Grammar is to provide the most mathematically elegant account of syntax possible, which is automatically assumed to be the one that underlies human linguistic competence. (Tomasello, 1998)
	•	mathematical elegance was the justification for transformation rules in the first place (Chomsky, 1957, 1965), and new formalizations designed to increase elegance (e.g., the new minimalism; Chomsky, 1995) are immediately posited as constitutive of the human language capacity, with no empirical verification deemed necessary. (Tomasello, 1998)
	•	The goal of mathematical elegance is difficult to discern in the several well-known versions of what might be called Generative Grammar Lite, including most prominently those of Jackendoff (1997) and Pinker (1994; Pinker & Bloom, 1990). (Tomasello, 1998)
	•	This view of Generative Grammar as based on a pretheoretical commitment to a mathematical approach which leads ineluctably to the Autonomy of Syntax thesis is not widely recognized by psychologists. (Tomasello, 1998)
	•	As in all mathematics, Generative Grammar begins with an absolute distinction between syntax abstract formulae that operate on meaningless category labels for variables and semantics interpretations of these formulae in the specific cases in which the values of the variables are insubstantiated. (Tomasello, 1998)
	•	In Generative Grammar, noun phrases (NPs) are category labels that are of central importance. Many syntactic rules (or the modern equivalent of rules) employ this category label. (Tomasello, 1998)
	•	The Generative Grammar claim is that it has no meaning, nor do other labels of the same type, and so syntactic rules written with it are autonomous from semantics. But NP is a highly meaningful category. An NP is an element in an utterance that is used in discourse to isolate and identify for the listener some "thing" where "thing" is simply a way of construing an aspect of experience, however abstract and intangible, as a bounded entity on analogy with a concrete object (Hopper & Thompson, 1984; Langacker, 1987b). (Tomasello, 1998)
	•	Generative grammarians use this functional information implicitly, they just do not put it in their analyses. (Tomasello, 1998)

Grandiosity
	•	Sudden success or winnings can be very dangerous. Neurologically, chemicals are released in the brain that give a powerful jolt of arousal and energy, leading to the desire to repeat this experience. It can be the start of any kind of addiction and manic behaviour. Also, when gains come quickly we tend to lose sight of the basic wisdom that true success, to really last, must come through hard work. We do not take into account the role that luck plays in such sudden gains. We try again and again to recapture that high from winning so much money or attention. We acquire feelings of grandiosity. We become especially resistant to anyone who tries to warn us—they don’t understand, we tell ourselves. Because this cannot be sustained, we experience an inevitable fall, which is all the more painful, leading to the depression part of the cycle. Although gamblers are the most prone to this, it equally applies to businesspeople during bubbles and to people who gain sudden attention from the public. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Confidence without Self-awareness and control can become grandiosity. Without conscious effort, these strengths will tend to wear down or turn into weaknesses. What this means is that the weakest parts of our character are the ones that create habits and compulsive behavior, because they do not require effort or practice to maintain. (Greene, 2018)
	•	We humans have a deep need to think highly of ourselves. If that opinion of our goodness, greatness, and brilliance diverges enough from reality, we become grandiose. We imagine our superiority. Often a small measure of success will elevate our natural grandiosity to even more dangerous levels. Our high self-opinion has now been confirmed by events. We forget the role that luck may have played in the success, or the contributions of others. We imagine we have the golden touch. Losing contact with reality, we make irrational decisions. That is why our success often does not last.  (Greene, 2018)
	•	Look for the signs of elevated grandiosity in yourself and in others— overbearing certainty in the positive outcome of your plans; excessive touchiness if criticized; a disdain for any form of authority. Counteract the pull of grandiosity by maintaining a realistic assessment of yourself and your limits. Tie any feelings of greatness to your work, your achievements, and your contributions to society. (Greene, 2018)
	•	we humans possess a weakness that is latent in us all and will push us into the delusional process without our ever being aware of the dynamic. The weakness stems from our natural tendency to overestimate our skills. We normally have a self-opinion that is somewhat elevated in relation to reality. We have a deep need to feel ourselves superior to others in something— intelligence, beauty, charm, popularity, or saintliness. This can be a positive. A degree of confidence impels us to take on challenges, to push past our supposed limits, and to learn in the process. But once we experience success on any level—increased attention from an individual or group, a promotion, funding for a project—that confidence will tend to rise too quickly, and there will be an ever-growing discrepancy between our self-opinion and reality. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Any success that we have in life inevitably depends on some good luck, timing, the contributions of others, the teachers who helped us along the way, the whims of the public in need of something new. Our tendency is to forget all of this and imagine that any success stems from our superior self. We begin to assume we can handle new challenges well before we are ready. After all, people have confirmed our greatness with their attention, and we want to keep it coming. We imagine we have the golden touch and that we can now magically transfer our skills to some other medium or field. Without realizing it,we become more attuned to our ego and our fantasies than to the people we work for and our audience. We grow distant from those who are helping us, seeing them as tools to be used. And with any failures that occur we tend to blame others. Success has an irresistible pull to it that tends to cloud our minds. (Greene, 2018)
	•	the gods are merciless with those who fly too high on the wings of grandiosity, and they will make you pay the price. (Greene, 2018)
	•	We can call this psychological disease grandiosity. As you feel its effects, the normal realistic proportions are reversed—your self becomes larger and greater than anything else around it. That is the lens through which you view the task and the people you need to reach. This is not merely deep narcissism (see chapter 2), in which everything must revolve around you. This is seeing yourself as enlarged (the root of the word grandiosity meaning “big” or “great”), as superior and worthy of not only attention but of being adored. It is a feeling of being not merely human but godlike.You may think of powerful, egotistical leaders in the public eye as the ones who contract such a disease, but you would be very wrong inthat assumption. (Greene, 2018)
	•	As we get older, we may not be physically small anymore, but our sense of insignificance only gets worse. We come to realize we are one person not just in a larger family, school, or city but in an entire globe filled with billions of people. Our lives are relatively short. We have limited skills and brainpower. There is so much we cannot control, particularly with our careers and global trends. The idea that we will die and be quickly forgotten, swallowed up in eternity, is quite intolerable. We want to feel significant in some way, to protest against our natural smallness, to expand our sense of self. What we experienced at the age of three or four unconsciously haunts us our entire lives. We alternate between moments of sensing our smallness and trying to deny it. This makes us prone to finding ways to imagine our superiority. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Today, in the Western world, religions and great causes have lost their binding power; we find it hard to believe in them and to satisfy our grandiose energy through identification with a greater power. The need to feel larger and significant, however, does not simply disappear; it is stronger than ever. And absent any other channels, people will tend to direct this energy toward themselves. They will find a way to expand their sense of self, to feel great and superior. Although rarely conscious of this, what they are choosing to idealize and worship is theself. Because of this, we find more and more grandiose individuals among us. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Other factors have also contributed to increases in grandiosity. First, we find more people who experienced pampering attention in their childhood than ever in the past. Feeling like they were once the center of the universe becomes a hard thing to shake. They come to believe that anything they do or produce should be seen as precious and worthy of attention. Second, we find increasing numbers of people who have little or no respect for authority or experts of any kind, no matter the experts’ level of training and experience, which they themselves lack. “Why should their opinion be any more valid than my own?” they might tell themselves. “Nobody’s really that great; people with power are just more privileged.” “My writing and music are just as legitimate and worthy as anyone else’s.” Without a sense of anyone rightly being above them and deserving authority, they can position themselves among the highest.Third, technology gives us the impression that everything in life can be as fast and simple as the information we can glean online. It instills the belief that we no longer have to spend years learning a skill; instead, through a few tricks and with a few hours a week of practice we can become proficient at anything. Similarly, people believe that their skills can easily be transferred: “My ability to write means I can also direct a film.” (Greene, 2018)
	•	But more than anything it is social media that spreads the grandiosity virus. Through social media we have almost limitless powers to expand our presence, to create the illusion that we have the attention and even adoration of thousands or millions of people. We can possess the fame and ubiquity of the kings and queens in the past, or even of the gods themselves. (Greene, 2018)
	•	With all of these elements combined, it is harder than ever for any of us to maintain a realistic attitude and a proportionate sense of self. (Greene, 2018)
	•	In looking at the people around you, you must realize that their grandiosity (and yours) can come in many different forms. Most commonly people will try to satisfy the need by gaining social prestige. People may claim they are interested in the work itself or in contributing to humanity, but often deep down what is really motivating them is the desire to have attention, to have their high self- opinion confirmed by others who admire them, to feel powerful and inflated. If they are talented, such types can get the attention they needfor several years or longer, but inevitably, as in the story of Eisner, their need for accolades will lure them into overreaching. (Greene, 2018)
	•	People still tend to idealize leaders and worship them, and you must see this as a form of grandiosity. By believing someone else will make everything great, followers can feel something of this greatness. Their minds can soar along with the rhetoric of the leader. They can feel superior to those who are not believers. On a more personal level, people will often idealize those they love, elevating them to god or goddess status and by extension feeling some of this power reflected back on them. (Greene, 2018)
	•	You can measure the levels of grandiosity in people in several simple ways. For instance, notice how people respond to criticism of them or their work. It’s normal for any of us to feel defensive and a bit upset when criticized. But some people become enraged and hysterical, because we have called into doubt their sense of greatness. You can be sure that such a person has high levels of grandiosity. Similarly, such types might conceal their rage behind a martyred, pained expression meant to make you feel guilty. The emphasis is not on the criticism itself and what they need to learn but on their sense of grievance. (Greene, 2018)
	•	If people are successful, notice how they act in more private moments. Are they able to relax and laugh at themselves, letting go of their public mask, or have they so overidentified with their powerful public image that it carries over into their private life? In the latter case, they have come to believe in their own myth and are in the grip of powerful grandiosity. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Grandiose people are generally big talkers. They take credit for anything that is even tangential to their work; they invent past successes. They talk of their prescience, how they foresaw certain trends or predicted certain events, none of which can be verified. All such talk should make you doubly dubious. If people in the public eye suddenly say something that gets them into trouble for being insensitive, you can ascribe that to their potent grandiosity. They are so attuned to their own great opinions that they assume everyone else will interpret them in the right spirit and agree with them. (Greene, 2018)
	•	With those who exhibit moderate amounts of grandiosity, you should be indulgent. Almost all of us alternate between periods in which we feel superior and great and others in which we come back down to earth. Look for such moments of realism in people as signs ofnormalcy. (Greene, 2018)
	•	you will need to manage your own grandiose tendencies. Grandiosity has some positive and productive uses. The exuberance and high self-belief that come from it can be channeled into your work and help inspire you. (See “Practical Grandiosity,” on this page, for more on this.) But in general it would be best for you to accept your limitations and work with what you have, rather than fantasize about godlike powers you can never attain. (Greene, 2018)
	•	The greatest protection you can have against grandiosity is to maintain a realistic attitude. You know what subjects and activities you are naturally attracted to. You cannot be skilled at everything. You need to play to your strengths and not imagine you can be great at whatever you put your mind to. You must have a thorough understanding of your energy levels, of how far you can reasonably push yourself, and of how this changes with age. And you must have a solid grasp on your social position—your allies, the people with whom you have the greatest rapport, the natural audience for your work. You cannot please everyone. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Grandiosity is a form of primal energy we all possess. It impels us to want something more than we have, to be recognized and esteemed by others, and to feel connected to something larger. The problem is not with the energy itself, which can be used to fuel our ambitions, but with the direction it takes. (Greene, 2018)
Fantastical grandiosity
	•	Normally grandiosity makes us imagine we are greater and more superior than is actually the case. We can call this fantastical grandiosity because it is based on our fantasies and the skewed impression we get from any attention we receive. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Fantastical grandiosity will make you flit from one fantastic idea to another, imagining all the accolades and attention you’ll receive but never realizing any of them. (Greene, 2018)
	•	The problem with fantastical grandiosity is that you imagine some great new goal you will achieve—that brilliant novel you will write, that lucrative start-up you will create. The challenge is so great that you may start, but you will soon peter out as you realize you are not up to it. Or if you are the ambitious, assertive type, you might try to go all the way, but you will end up in the Euro Disney syndrome, overwhelmed, failing in a large fashion, blaming others for the fiasco, and never learning from the experience. (Greene, 2018)
Grandiose humility
	•	In the world today, you will also notice the prevalence of negative forms of grandiosity. Many people feel the need to disguise their grandiose urges not only from others but also from themselves. They will frequently make a show of their humility—they are not interested in power or feeling important, or so they say. They are happy with their small lot in life. They do not want a lot of possessions, do not own a car, and disdain status. But you will notice they have a need to display this humility in a public manner. It is grandiose humility—their way to get attention and to feel morally superior. (Greene, 2018)
Grandiose victim
	•	A variation on this is the grandiose victim—they have suffered a lot and been the victim numerous times. Although they may like to frame it as being simply unlucky and unfortunate, you will notice that they often have a tendency to fall for the worst types in intimate relationships, or put themselves in circumstances in which they are certain to fail and suffer. In essence, they are compelled to create the drama that will turn them into a victim. As it turns out, any relationship with them will have to revolve around their needs; they have suffered too much in the past to attend to your needs. They are the center of the universe. Feeling and expressing their misfortune gives them their sense of importance, of being superior in suffering. (Greene, 2018)
Higher grandiose 
	•	Higher grandiose types generally display low levels of empathy. They are not good listeners. When the attention is not on them, they have a faraway look in their eyes and their fingers twitch with impatience. Only when the spotlight is on them do they become animated. They tend to see people as extensions of themselves—tools to be used in their schemes, sources of attention. Finally, they exhibit nonverbal behavior that can only be described as grandiose. Their gestures are big and dramatic. At a meeting, they take up a lot of personal space. Their voice tends to be louder than others, and they speak at a fast pace, giving no one else time to interrupt. (Greene, 2018)
	•	with those whose self-opinion is so high they cannot allow for any doubts, it is best to avoid relationships or entanglements. In intimate relationships, they will tend to demand adoring one-sided attention. If they are employees, business partners, or bosses, they will oversell their skills. Their levels of confidence will distract you from the deficiencies in their ideas, work habits, and character. If you cannot avoid such a relationship, be aware of their tendency to feel certain about the success of their ideas, and maintain your skepticism. Look at the ideas themselves and don’t get caught up in their seductive self- belief. Don’t entertain the illusion that you can confront them and try to bring them down to earth; you may trigger a rage response. (Greene, 2018)
	•	If such types happen to be your rivals, consider yourself lucky. They are easy to taunt and bait into overreactions. Casting doubts on their greatness will make them apoplectic and doubly irrational. (Greene, 2018)
Infantile grandiosity
	•	at the source of our infantile grandiosity was a feeling of intense connection to the mother. This was so complete and satisfying that we spend much of our time trying to recapture that feeling in some way. It is the source of our desire to transcend our banalexistence, to want something so large we cannot express what it is. We have glimmers of that original connection in intimate relationships and in moments of unconditional love, but these are rare and fleeting. (Greene, 2018)
Low grade grandiosity
	•	You are rarely aware of your own grandiosity because by its nature it alters your perception of reality and makes it hard to have an accurate assessment of yourself. And so you are unaware of the problems it might be causing you at this very moment. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Your low-grade grandiosity will cause you to overestimate your own skills and abilities and to underestimate the obstacles that you face. And so you will take on tasks that are beyond your actual capacity. You will feel certain that people will respond to your idea in a particular way, and when they don’t, you will become upset and blame others. (Greene, 2018)
	•	You may become restless and suddenly make a career change, not realizing that grandiosity is at the root—your present work is not confirming your greatness and superiority, because to be truly great would require more years of training and the development of new skills. Better to quit and be lured by the possibilities a new career offers, allowing you to entertain fantasies of greatness. In this way, you never quite master anything. You may have dozens of great ideas that you never attempt to execute, because that would cause you to confront the reality of your actual skill level. Without being aware of it, you might become ever so slightly passive—you expect other people to understand you, give you what you want, treat you well. Instead of earning their praise, you feel entitled to it. (Greene, 2018)
	•	In all of these cases, your low-grade grandiosity will prevent you from learning from your mistakes and developing yourself, because you begin with the assumption that you are already large and great, and it is too difficult to admit otherwise. (Greene, 2018)
Normally grandiosity
	•	Normally grandiosity makes us imagine we are greater and more superior than is actually the case. We can call this fantastical grandiosity because it is based on our fantasies and the skewed impression we get from any attention we receive. (Greene, 2018)
Practical grandiosity
	•	The other form, which we shall call practical grandiosity, is not easy to achieve and does not come naturally to us, but it can be the source of tremendous power and self-fulfillment. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Practical grandiosity is based not on fantasy but on reality. The energy is channeled into our work and our desire to reach goals, to solve problems, or to improve relationships. It impels us to develop and hone our skills. Through our accomplishments we can feel greater. We attract attention through our work. The attention we receive in this way is gratifying and keeps us energized, but the greater sense of gratification comes from the work itself and from overcoming our own weaknesses. The desire for attention is under control and subordinate. Our self-esteem is raised, but it is tied to real achievements, not to nebulous, subjective fantasies. We feel our presence enlarged through our work, through what we contribute to society. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Come to terms with your grandiose needs. You need to begin from a position of honesty. You must admit to yourself that you do want to feel important and be the center of attention. This is natural. Yes, you want to feel superior. You have ambitions like everyone else. In the past, your grandiose needs may have led you into some bad decisions, which you can now acknowledge and analyze. Denial is your worst enemy. Only with this self-awareness can you begin to transform the energy into something practical and productive. (Greene, 2018)
	•	This could be a project you work on outside your job. It is not the number of hours you put in but the intensity and consistent effort you bring to it.Related to this, you want this project to involve skills you already have or are in the process of developing. Your goal is to see continual improvement in your skill level, which will certainly come from the depth of your focus. Your confidence will rise. That should be enough to keep you advancing. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Maintain a dialogue with reality. Your project begins with an idea, and as you try to hone this idea, you let your imagination take flight, being open to various possibilities. At some point you move from theplanning phase to execution. Now you must actively search for feedback and criticism from people you respect or from your natural audience. You want to hear about the flaws and inadequacies in your plan, for that is the only way to improve your skills. If the project fails to have the results you imagined, or the problem is not solved, embrace this as the best way to learn. Analyze what you did wrong in depth, being as brutal as possible.Once you have feedback and have analyzed the results, you then return to this project or start a new one, letting your imagination loose again but incorporating what you have learned from the experience. You keep cycling endlessly through this process, noticing with excitement how you are improving by doing so. If you stay too long in the imagination phase, what you create will tend to be grandiose and detached from reality. If you only listen to feedback and try to make the work a complete reflection of what others tell you or want, the work will be conventional and flat. By maintaining a continual dialogue between reality (feedback) and your imagination, you will create something practical and powerful.If you have any success with your projects, that is when you must step back from the attention you are receiving. Look at the role that luck may have played, or the help you received from others. Resist falling for the success delusion. As you now focus on the next idea, see yourself back at square one. Each new project represents a new challenge and a fresh approach. You might very well fail. You need the same level of focus as you had on the last project. Never rest on your laurels or let up in your intensity. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Your goal with practical grandiosity is to continually look for challenges just above your skill level. If the projects you attempt are below or at your skill level, you will become easily bored and less focused. If they are too ambitious, you will feel crushed by your failure.However, if they are calibrated to be more challenging than the last project, but to a moderate degree, you will find yourself excited and energized. You must be up to this challenge so your focus levels will rise as well. This is the optimum path toward learning. If you fail, you will not feel overwhelmed and you will learn even more. If you succeed, your confidence increases, but it is tied to your work and to having met the challenge. Your sense of accomplishment will satisfy your need for greatness. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Let loose your grandiose energy. Once you have tamed this energy, made it serve your ambitions and goals, you should feel safe to let it loose upon occasion. Think of it as a wild animal that needs to roam free now and then or it will go mad from restlessness. What this means is that you occasionally allow yourself to entertain ideas or projects that represent greater challenges than you have considered in the past. You feel increasingly confident and you want to test yourself. Consider developing a new skill in an unrelated field, or writing that novel you once considered a distraction from the real work. Or simply give freer rein to your imagination when in the planning process.If you are in the public eye and must perform before others, let go of the restraint you have developed and let your grandiose energy fill you with high levels of self-belief. This will animate your gestures and give you greater charisma. If you are a leader and your group is facing difficulties or a crisis, let yourself feel unusually grandiose and confident in the success of your mission, to lift up and inspire the troops. That was the kind of grandiosity that made Winston Churchill such an effective leader during World War II. (Greene, 2018)
	•	In any event, you can allow yourself to feel ever so godlike because you have come so far with your improved skills and actual achievements. If you have taken the time to properly work through the other principles, you will naturally return back down to earth after a few days or hours of grandiose exuberance. (Greene, 2018)
Grand strategy
	•	Grand strategy is a three-step process: determining a state's vital security interests; identifying the threats to those interests; and deciding how best to employ the state's political, military, and economic resources to protect those interest. The outcome of the process, however, is indeterminate: the specific grand strategy that emerges will reflect policymakers' views of how the world works. (Layne, 2011)
	•	Grand strategy is a fuzzy concept. (Taras and Zeringue, 1992)
	•	Gaddis describes grand strategy with broad strokes and implications: ' it is simply the application of "strategy" ['the calculated relation of ends and means], by states acting within the international state system, to secure their interests; it is what leads, if all goes well, to "statecraft." (Taras and Zeringue, 1992)
	•	Luttwak writes that 'grand strategy may be seen as a confluence of the military interactions that flow up and down level by level— forming strategy's vertical dimension—with the varied external relations that form strategy's horizontal dimension at its highest level (Taras and Zeringue, 1992)
	•	grand strategy reflected the new constraints and incentives of the international system. (Taras and Zeringue, 1992)
	•	The influence of polarity effects on the formulation of grand strategy is evident throughout history. (Taras and Zeringue, 1992)
	•	A state's grand strategy is determined by more than its perception of the principal external threat alone. (Taras and Zeringue, 1992)
	•	"Grand strategy" is an important sounding term but the concept is simple: it is the process by which a state matches ends and means in the pursuit of security. In peacetime, grand strategy encompasses the following: defining the state's security interests; identifying the threats to those interests; and allocating military, diplomatic, and economic resources to defend the state's interests.(Layne, 1998)
	•	Thus the debate about U.S. grand strategy touches on the following questions: What regions of the world are important to U.S. security? Will new great powers rise to threaten American interests? What alliance commitments should the United States undertake? Does the United States have a stake in regional "stability"(and, if so, in which regions), and in economic interdependence? What military forces does the United States need to defend its interests? What is the proper balance between America's external commitments and its domestic needs? (Layne, 1998)
	•	After all, since the end of the Second World War, U.S. strategy ostensibly was shaped by the need to contain the Soviet Union. (Layne, 1998)
	•	Grand strategy represents a road map delineating our most important foreign policy goals and the most effective instruments and policies for achieving those goals. It contains a vision for America's role in the world based in part on America's domestic needs and in part on the international challenges the country faces. It thus establishes priorities and gives focus to an otherwise volatile foreign policymaking process that can be driven by national mood swings and the CNN effect. In this sense, it also adds an important element of predictability and stability for other countries. But these virtues canal so be vices if they lock the country into misguided actions and the misallocation of scarce diplomatic and foreign policy resources. (Schwenninger, 2003)
	•	A grand strategy is a political–military, means–ends chain, a state’s theory about how it can best ‘cause’ security for itself. Ideally, it includes an explanation of why the theory is expected to work. A grand strategy must identify likely threats to the state’s security and it must devise political, economic, military, and other remedies for those threats. Priorities must be established among both threats and remedies [. . .] ideally, the grand strategy of a state should account for its effects on other states. (Posen, 1984: 13, 25) (Neumann and Heikka, 2005)
	•	‘Grand strategy’ is part of a conceptual hierarchy where the subordinate concepts, counted from the most specific level, are tactics, operations and strategy. (Neumann and Heikka, 2005)
	•	The development of the concept of ‘grand strategy’ comes as a continuation of Clausewitz’s central insight, i.e. that war is imbricated in general politics. (Neumann and Heikka, 2005)
	•	Grand strategy is the direction and use made of any or all of the assets of a security community, including its military instrument, for the purposes of policy as decided by politics. (Gray, 2014)
Graph
	•	Even a graph as simple as an innocent chain of nodes can be a rather complicated object to handle. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
Graph theory
	•	Graph theory allows us to encode in edges more complicated relationships, as when connections are not reciprocal. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
Random graph
	•	The random graph is a very simplified model, and its properties are very different from those of real networks. For example, randomness and chance could indeed play an important role in meeting new friends, but the formation of friendship networks is certainly related to many other factors, such as social class, common languages, affinity etc. However, the random graph model is very important because it quantifies the properties of a totally random network. Random graphs can be used as a benchmark, or null case, for any real network. This means that a random graph can be used in comparison to a real-world network, to understand how much chance has shaped the latter, and to what extent other criteria have played a role. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
	•	The simplest recipe for building a random graph is the following. We take all the possible pairs of vertices. For each pair, we toss a coin: if the result is heads, we draw a link; otherwise we pass to the next pair, until all the pairs are finished (this means drawing the link with a probability p = ½, but we may use whatever value of p). The simplest recipe for building a random graph is the following. We take all the possible pairs of vertices. For each pair, we toss a coin: if the result is heads, we draw a link; otherwise we pass to the next pair, until all the pairs are finished (this means drawing the link with a probability p = ½, but we may use whatever value of p). Typically, the creation of the graph and its study are not done manually. Scientists use computer programs and draw the resulting network on paper or on computer screen. However, this becomes increasing difficult when the network is large. Moreover, it is hard to study an interwoven structure just by visual inspection. A better and quantitative insight comes from studying the graph as an abstract object, by means of mathematical tools. Computers can also help: simulation allows us to build, within the ‘mind’ of a computer, a faithful realization of the model, and then make measurements of it as if it were a real object. If we want to compare the abstract model with a real-world network, now we just need to compare the measures in both cases. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)

Gratitude
	•	if you need a favor from people, do not remind them of what you have done for them in the past, trying to stimulate feelings of gratitude. Gratitude is rare because it tends to remind us of our helplessness, our dependence on others. We like to feel independent. Instead, remind them of the good things they have done for you in the past. This will help confirm their self-opinion: “Yes, I am generous.”  (Greene, 2018)
	•	Gratitude is a muscle that requires exercise or it will atrophy. (Greene, 2018)
Great power
	•	Great powers are determined on the basis of their relative military capability. To qualify as a great power, a state must have sufficient military assets to put up a serious fight in an all-out conventional war against the most powerful state in the world (Mearsheimer, 2014)
	•	All great powers inherently behave aggressively despite embracing liberal democracy (Toft, 2003)
	•	great powers will typically penetrate several adjacent regions, and superpowers will range over the whole planet (Buzan and Wæver, 2003)
	•	The world wars that followed were grounded in a universal ‘will to power’ that consumed the Great Powers. (Coker, 2009)
	•	When Great Powers forfeit their great power status they are sometimes missed. (Coker, 2009)
Great power game
	•	the Great Power game, one that is seeking to establish its position in a world that has been ordered strategically by earlier rivals. (Coker, 2009)
Gregarious tendency
	•	The gregarious tendency in man, according to Mr. Trotter, results in five characteristics which he displays in common with all gregarious animals. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	The gregarious tendency, Mr. Trotter believes, is biologically fundamental. He finds therefore that the herd reaction is not confined to outbreaks such as panics and mob violence, but that it is a constant factor in all human thinking and feeling. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
Geographical proximity
	•	The impact of geographical proximity on security interaction is strongest and most obvious in the military, political, societal, and environmental sectors. (Buzan and Wæver, 2003)
Greed
	•	Nothing blurred ethical lines faster than human greed. (Brown, 2018)

Grid
	•	The other dimension of grid-group theory, 'grid', is explained by Douglas in the following manner: The term grid suggests the cross-hatch of rules to which individuals are subject in the course of their interaction. As a dimension it shows a progressive change in the mode of control. At the strong end there are visible rules about space and time related to social roles; at the other end, near zero, the formal classifications Fade,and finally vanish. At the strong end of grid, individuals do not, as such, freelytransact with one another. An explicit set of institutionalized classifications keepthem apart and regulates their interactions, restricting their options (Douglas 1978:8). (Boholm, 1996)
Grief
	•	grief is a process of healing. (Kübler-Ross and Kessler, 2005)
Anticipatory grief
	•	That is our beginning of anticipatory grief: fear of the unknown, the pain we will someday experience. It is present in most of our childhood stories and movies as if they were archetypally preparing us. (Kübler-Ross and Kessler, 2005)
	•	Anticipatory grief is the “beginning of the end” in our minds. (Kübler-Ross and Kessler, 2005)
	•	Anticipatory grief is generally more silent than grief after a loss. We are often not as verbal. It’s a grief we keep to ourselves. (Kübler-Ross and Kessler, 2005)
	•	Anticipatory grief has its own process; it takes its own time. (Kübler-Ross and Kessler, 2005)
Grief framework
	•	The five stages-denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance- are a part of the framework that makes up our learning to live with the one we lost. (Kübler-Ross and Kessler, 2005)
	•	These feelings are important; they are the psyche’s protective mechanisms. (Kübler-Ross and Kessler, 2005)
	•	The stage of loss-denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance- have been widely used and misused. Our society almost seems to be involved in a “stamp out depression” campaign. (Kübler-Ross and Kessler, 2005)
Denial
	•	Denial and shock help us to cope and make survival possible. (Kübler-Ross and Kessler, 2005)
	•	Denial helps us to pace our feeling of grief. (Kübler-Ross and Kessler, 2005)
	•	The denial often comes in the form of our questioning our reality: Is it true? Did it really happen? Are they really gone? (Kübler-Ross and Kessler, 2005)
Anger
	•	Underneath anger is pain, your pain. It is natural to feel deserted and abandoned, but we live in a society that fears anger. (Kübler-Ross and Kessler, 2005)
	•	Anger is strength and it can be an anchor, giving temporary structure to the nothingness of loss. (Kübler-Ross and Kessler, 2005)
	•	The anger becomes a bridge over the open sea, a connection from you to them. It is something to hold on to, and a connection made from the strength of anger feels better than nothing. (Kübler-Ross and Kessler, 2005)
	•	Anger means you are progressing, that you are allowing all those feelings that were simply too much before to come to the surface. It is important to feel the anger without judging it, without attempting to find meaning in it. It may take many forms: anger at the health-care system, at life, at your loved for leaving.  (Kübler-Ross and Kessler, 2005)
	•	Life is unfair. Death is unfait. Anger is a natural reaction to the unfariness of loss. Unfortunately, however, anger can isolate you from friends and family at the precise time you may need them the most. (Kübler-Ross and Kessler, 2005)
	•	You may also experience feelings of guilt, which is anger turned inward on yourself. But you are not to blame. If you could change things, you would, but yo can’t. Anger affirms that you can feel, that you did love, and that you have lost. (Kübler-Ross and Kessler, 2005)
	•	Anger is the most immediate emotion. (Kübler-Ross and Kessler, 2005)
Bargaining
	•	Guilt is often bargaining’s companion. (Kübler-Ross and Kessler, 2005)
	•	The “if onlys” cause us to find fault with ourselves and what we “think” we could have done differently. (Kübler-Ross and Kessler, 2005)
	•	Bargaining changes over time. (Kübler-Ross and Kessler, 2005)
	•	As we move through the bargaining process, the mind alters past events while exploring all those “what if” and “if only” statements. (Kübler-Ross and Kessler, 2005)
Depression
	•	The depressive stage feels as though it will last forever. It’s important to understand that this depression is not a sign of mental illness. It is the appropriate response to a great loss. (Kübler-Ross and Kessler, 2005)
	•	Drepression after a loss is too often seen as unnatural: a state to be fixed, seomthing to snap out of. (Kübler-Ross and Kessler, 2005)
	•	But in grief, depression is a way for nature to keep us protected by shutting down the nervous system so that we can adapt to something we feel we cannot handle. (Kübler-Ross and Kessler, 2005)
	•	If grief is a process of healing, then depression is one of the many necessary steps along the way. (Kübler-Ross and Kessler, 2005)
	•	Seeking a way out of depression feels like going into a hurricane and sailing around the inside perimeter, fearful that there is no exit door. (Kübler-Ross and Kessler, 2005)
Acceptance
	•	Acceptance is often confused with the notion of being all right or okay with what has happenend. This I not the case. (Kübler-Ross and Kessler, 2005)
Groups
	•	groups refer to a collection of individuals who share a particular political outlook (van der Linden, 2016)
	•	Douglas offers the following characterization of the term group: The group itself is defined in terms of the claims it makes over its constituent members, the boundary it draws around them, the rights it confers on them to use its name and other protections, and the levies and constraints it applies. Group is one obvious environmental setting, but we seem unable to conceive of the individual's environment if it is not a group of some kind (Douglas 1978:8). (Boholm, 1996)
	•	What Walton and Hackman (1986) mean by a group is as follows: group is perceived as such both by members and non-members; members have significantly interdependent relations with one another; members have differentiated roles within the group; and the group operates in an organizational setting, managing relationships with other groups or their representatives. (Gupta, 2009)
	•	The researchers in the recent times have started viewing groups and teams as complex, adaptive, and dynamic systems.
	•	Many scholars seemed to have used the words ‘team’ and ‘group’ or ‘work group’ interchangeably. (Gupta, 2009)
	•	Rather than having a clean demarcation, teams and groups lie along a continuum that consists of the amount of interdependence among the people (Polzer, 2003). (Gupta, 2009)
	•	A close look at these definitions indicates that the word ‘group’ is a part of the definition of ‘team’. (Gupta, 2009)
	•	Team is a group. (Gupta, 2009)
Group approval
	•	We are all permeable to the influence of the group. What makes us more permeable is our insecurities. The less we are certain about our self-worth as individuals, the more we are unconsciously drawn toward fitting in and blending ourselves into the group spirit. Gaining the superficial approval of group members by displaying our conformity, we cover up our insecurities to ourselves and to others. But this approval is fleeting; our insecurities gnaw at us, and we must continually get people’s attention to feel validated. (Greene, 2018)
Group belief
	•	“L’important n’est pas la réalité de la vie, écrit R. Micchielli (1972, p.34), mais ce que les gens croient.” (Mannoni, 1985)
Group certainty
	•	When we are on our own and think about our decisions and plans, we naturally feel doubts. Have we chosen the right career path? Did we say the right thing to get the job? Are we adopting the best strategy? But when we are in the group, this doubting, reflective mechanism is neutralized. Let us say the group has to decide on an important strategy. We feel the urgency to act. Arguing and deliberating is tiring, and where will it end? We feel the pressure to decide and get behind the decision. If we dissent, we might be marginalized or excluded, and we recoil from such possibilities. Furthermore, if everyone seems to agree that this is the right course of action, we are compelled to feel confident about the decision. And so the fourth effect on us is to make us feel more certain about what we and our colleagues are doing, which makes us all the more prone to taking risks. (Greene, 2018)
	•	This is what happens in financial crazes and bubbles—if everyone is betting on the price of tulips or South Sea stock (see chapter 6) or subprime mortgages, it must be a sure thing. Those who raise doubts are simply being too cautious. As individuals, it is hard to resist what others seem so certain about. We don’t want to miss out. Furthermore, if we were among just a few who bought this stock, and it failed, we would feel ridiculous and ashamed, sadly responsible for being such a sucker. But covered by thousands doing the same, we are shielded from feeling accountable, which increases the likelihood we will take such risks in the group setting. (Greene, 2018)
	•	If as individuals we had some plan that was clearly ridiculous, others would warn us and bring us back down to earth, but in a group the opposite happens—everyone seems to validate the scheme, no matter how delusional (such as invading Iraq and expecting to be greeted as liberators), and there are no outsiders to splash some cold water on us. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Whenever you feel unusually certain and excited about a plan or idea, you must step back and gauge whether it is a viral group effect operating on you. If you can detach yourself for a moment from your excitement, you might notice how your thinking is used to rationalizeyour emotions, to confirm the certainty you want to feel. Never relinquish your ability to doubt, reflect, and consider other options— your rationality as an individual is your only protection against the madness that can overcome a group. (Greene, 2018)
Group change
	•	Le changement de groupe — lorsqu’il est possible, ce qui est loin d’être toujours le cas — provoque un changement de registre normatif. (Mannoni, 1985)
Group conformity
	•	The first and primary effect on you in any group is the desire to fit in and cement your sense of belonging. The more you fit in, the less you pose a challenge to the group and its values. This will minimize the scrutiny you face and the anxiety that comes with it. (Greene, 2018)
	•	The second and more important way you fit in is by adopting the ideas, beliefs, and values of the group. You may begin to use similar verbal expressions as others, a sign of what’s happening below the surface. Your own ideas slowly shape themselves to those of the group. Some people may outwardly rebel against such conformity, but they are usually the types who are eventually fired or marginalized. You may hold on to a few peculiar beliefs or opinions that you largely keep to yourself, but not on issues important to the group. The longer you are in the group, the stronger and more insidious this effect. (Greene, 2018)
	•	If you observed this group from the outside, you would notice an overall uniformity of thinking that is quite surprising, considering that as individuals we all differ quite a bit from one another in temperament and background. This is a sign of the subtle molding and conformity that takes place. You might have joined a group because you share their ideas and values, but you will find over time that the parts of your thinking that were a little different from others, reflecting your uniqueness, are slowly trimmed way, like a shrub made to match the others, so that on almost all issues you agree with the group. (Greene, 2018)
	•	You are not aware of all this as it is happening to you. It occurs unconsciously. In fact, you will tend to vociferously deny suchconformity has ever taken place. You will imagine that you have come upon these ideas on your own, that you have chosen to believe this and think that. You don’t want to confront the social force operating on you and causing you to blend in and enhance your sense of belonging. In the long run, it is much better to confront your conformity to the group ethos, so that you can become aware of it as it happens and control the process to some degree. (Greene, 2018)
Group contagion
	•	the third effect of the group on us—the contagiousness of emotions.When we are alone, we are aware of our shifting moods, but the moment we enter the group and feel the eyes of others upon us, we become aware on unconscious levels of their moods and emotions, which, if strong enough, can displace our own. In addition, among those whom we feel comfortable and sense that we belong, we are less defensive and more vulnerable to the contagious effect. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Certain emotions are more contagious than others, anxiety and fear being the strongest of all. Among our ancestors, if one person sensed a danger, it was important that others feel this as well. But in our present environment, where the threats are less immediate, it is more like a low-grade anxiety that passes quickly through the group, triggered by possible or imagined dangers. (Greene, 2018)
	•	 Other highly contagious emotions are joy and excitement, tiredness and apathy, and intense anger and hatred. Desire is also highly contagious. If we see that others want to possess something or follow some new trend, we are easily infected with the same impulse. (Greene, 2018)
	•	All of these effects have a self-fulfilling dynamic: If three people are feeling anxious, there must be a good reason for it. Now we become the fourth, and it gains a reality that others find compelling. The more people who feel it, the more others will catch it and the more intense it becomes within us as individuals. (Greene, 2018)
	•	If others in the group are feeling anxious or outraged by something, we often get swept up in the group mood. All of these are subtle indications that we are under the influence of the group. If we are experiencing the above transformations, we can be sure the same is going on with our colleagues. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Does that anxiety or sense of outrage that we feel come completely from within, or is it inspired by the group? We must observe our tendency to demonize the enemy and control it. We must train ourselves to not blindly venerate our leaders; we respect them for their accomplishments without feeling the need to deify them. We must be especially careful around those who have charismatic appeal, and try to demystify and pull them down to earth. With such awareness, we can begin to resist and detach. (Greene, 2018)
	•	La seconde cause est « la contagion mentale » (ibid.) que l’auteur rattache aux phénomènes d’ordre hypnotique. « Chez une foule, écrit-il, tout sentiment, tout acte est contagieux à ce point que l’individu sacrifie très facilement son intérêt personnel à l’intérêt collectif. C’est là une aptitude contraire à sa nature, et dont l’homme ne devient guère capable que lorsqu’il fait partie d’une foule. ». (Mannoni, 1985)
Group court
	•	Observe any community of chimpanzees at the zoo, and you will notice the existence of an alpha male and other chimpanzees adapting their behavior to him, fawning, imitating, and struggling to forge closer ties. This is the prehuman version of the court. (Greene, 2018)
	•	We humans created a more elaborate version in aristocratic courts, dating from the earliest civilizations. In the aristocratic court, the subordinate members depended on the king or queen’s favor to survive and thrive; the object of the game was to get closer to the man or woman on top without alienating the other courtiers, or to gang up and depose the leader, always a risky venture. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Today the court will form around the film executive, the head of an academic department, the CEO of a business venture, the political boss, the owner of an art gallery, a critic or artist who has cultural power. In a large group, there will be subcourts formed around subleaders. The more powerful the leader, the more intense is the gamesmanship. The courtiers may look different now, but their behavior and strategies are pretty much the same. You must take note of a few of these behavioral patterns. (Greene, 2018)
	•	courtiers have to gain the attention of leaders and ingratiate themselves in some way. The most immediate way to do this is through flattery, since leaders inevitably have large egos and a hunger to have their high self-opinion validated. Flattery can do wonders, but it comeswith risks. If it is too obvious, the flatterer looks desperate, and it is easy to see through the strategy. The best courtiers know how to tailor their flattery to the particular insecurities of the leader and to make it less direct. They focus on flattering qualities in the leader that no one else has bothered to pay attention to but that need extra validation. If everyone praises the leader’s business acumen but not his or her cultural refinement, you will want to aim at the latter. Mirroring the leader’s ideas and values, without using their exact words, can be a highly effective form of indirect flattery. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Keep in mind that forms of acceptable flattery will differ in each court. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Adapt your flattery to the group spirit, and make it as indirect as possible. (Greene, 2018)
	•	you must pay great attention to the other courtiers. Standing out too much, being seen as too brilliant or charming, will stir up envy, and you will die by a thousand bites. You want as many courtiers on your side as possible. Learn to downplay your successes, to listen (or seem to listen) deeply to the ideas of others, strategically giving them credit and praise in meetings, paying attention to their insecurities. If you must take action against particular courtiers, make it as indirect as possible, working to slowly isolate them in the group, never appearing too aggressive. Courts are always supposed to seem civilized. Be aware that the best courtiers are consummate actors and that their smiles and professions of loyalty mean very little. In the court, it does not pay to be naive. Without being paranoid, try to question people’s motives. (Greene, 2018)
	•	you need to be aware of the types of courtiers you will find in most courts and the particular dangers they can pose. One aggressive but clever courtier with little conscience can quickly dominate the group. (For more on the types of courtiers, see the next section.) (Greene, 2018)
	•	Keep in mind that there is no way to opt out of the court dynamic. Trying to act superior to the political games or the need to flatter willonly make you look suspicious to others; nobody likes the holier-than- thou attitude. All you’ll get for your “honesty” is to be marginalized. Better to be the consummate courtier and find some pleasure in the game of court strategy. (Greene, 2018)
Group culture
	•	It is all part of the social force blending and knitting the group together based on the particular chemistry of its members. (Greene, 2018)
	•	When looking at your own group and its culture, think in terms of style and the overall mood that prevails. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Its style can have degrees of the above qualities, or combinations of them, but the group will always have some type of identifiable cultureand spirit. Two things to keep in mind: First, the culture will often center on an ideal that the group imagines for itself—liberal, modern, progressive, ruthlessly competitive, tasteful, et cetera. The group may not live up to this ideal, but to the degree that it tries to, the ideal operates as a myth that binds the group’s members. Second, this culture will often reflect the founders of the group, particularly if they have a strong personality. With their own rigid or loose style, they have put their stamp on the group, even if it numbers in the thousands. But leaders who enter a group or company that has its set culture will often find themselves completely absorbed by this culture, even though they might think of altering it. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Gaining a deeper appreciation of the culture and codes will make it much easier to navigate the social space and maintain a degree of detachment. You will not try to change what cannot be changed. When it comes to the inevitable factions that emerge, it is better to keep yourself unaligned and let others fight over you. You do not need to belong to a faction to derive a narcissistic boost. What you want within the group is strategic options and room to maneuver, to have many allies and widen your power base. (Greene, 2018)
Group dynamic
	•	Since the beginning of recorded history, we can observe certain patterns that human groups fall into almost automatically, as if they were subject to particular mathematical or physical laws.  (Greene, 2018)
Group dysfunctoinning dynamic
	•	The reason for this common pattern is simple: what is really at fault is the dysfunctional dynamic of the group, which tends to produce incompetent lieutenants and grandiose leaders. And unless it is fixed, the problems keep recurring with different faces. (Greene, 2018)
	•	In a dysfunctional culture, the members are often confused about their roles and the overall direction of the group. Amid such confusion, people start to think more of their own interests and agendas, and they form factions. Worried more about their status than the health of the group, their egos become touchy, and they obsess over who’s getting more. In this contentious atmosphere, the bad apples—the Stirrers, the men and women of low character—find numerous ways to stir trouble and promote themselves. Those who excel at schmoozing and playing politics but little else often thrive, rise to the top, and become lieutenants. Mediocrity is preferred and rewarded. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Leaders find themselves dragged down by all the internal dissension and gamesmanship. Feeling vulnerable, they surround themselves with courtiers who tell them what they want to hear. Inside this court cocoon, leaders hatch ill-conceived and grandiose plans, which are encouraged by the spineless courtiers. Firing the leader or lieutenants won’t change anything. The next ones will simply find themselves infected and transformed by the dysfunctional culture. (Greene, 2018)
	•	What we don’t consider, however, is that being in a dysfunctional group can actually make individuals unstable and neurotic. (Greene, 2018)
Organizational group
	•	Brett and Rognes (1986) defined an organizational group as “a set of individuals who perceive themselves and whom non-members perceive as constituting an identifiable social aggregate within an organization … The only definitional requirement is that members and non-members recognize the group as a distinguishable social aggregate that exists within the boundaries of the organization”. (Gupta, 2009)
Group enemy
	•	As mentioned above, our ancestors had a reflexive fear at the sight of any outsiders to their group. This fear easily slid into hatred. The basis for this fear may well have been real, but the existence of rival tribes also had a positive side effect—it united and tightened the group. It also fit in well with the way the human brain processes information, through binary pairs of opposites—light and dark, good and evil, us versus them. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Today, in our modern sophisticated world, you will notice this very ancient dynamic continually at play: any group will reflexively focus on some hated enemy, real or imagined, to help bring the tribe together. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Since time immemorial, leaders have exploited this enemy reflex for power, using the existence of the rival or enemy to justify almost anything and to distract from their own shortcomings. The enemy will be described as “amoral,” “irrational,” “untrustworthy,” or “aggressive,” the implication being that “our” group is the opposite. No side ever likes to admit it is not pure in its ethics, or has aggressive intentions, or is governed by emotion—it is always the other side. In the end, the need to feel a part of the tribe and against the other side is more important than the actual differences, which tend to be greatly exaggerated. (Greene, 2018)
Group faction
	•	Over enough time, individuals in a group will begin to split off into factions. The reason for this dynamic is simple: In a group, we get a narcissistic boost from being around those who share our values. But in a group over a certain size, this becomes tooabstract. The differences among the members become noticeable. Our power to influence the group as individuals is reduced. We want something more immediate, and so we form subgroups and cliques with those who seem even more like us, giving us back that narcissistic boost. In this subgrouping, we now have power to divvy up, which increases its members’ sense of self-importance. Eventually the faction will experience its own splits from within, on and on. (Greene, 2018)
	•	This splitting occurs unconsciously, almost as if it were responding to mechanical laws of group fission. (Greene, 2018)
	•	If a faction gets strong enough, its members will start to give precedence to its interests over that of the greater group. Some leaders try to exploit this dynamic by playing one faction off the other, in the form of divide and conquer: the more the factions fight, the weaker they become, and the greater the power in the hands of the man or woman on top. (Greene, 2018)
	•	One faction to pay particular attention to is the one that is formed by those in the higher echelons, which we can identify as the elites in the group. (Greene, 2018)
Elite group
	•	One faction to pay particular attention to is the one that is formed by those in the higher echelons, which we can identify as the elites in the group. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Although elites themselves sometimes split into rival factions, more often than not, when push comes to shove, they will unite and work to preserve their elite status. The clan tends to look after its own, all the more so among the powerful. They will inevitably manage to bend the group rules to ensure they tilt in their favor. (Greene, 2018)
	•	In these democratic times, they will try to cover this up by posturing that what they are doing is for the greater good of the group. If the elites prosper, so will everyone else, they say. But you will never actually see the elite faction doing things that will lessen their power, or making true sacrifices. Somehow it is always those not among the elites who must make the sacrifices. Try not to fall for their rationalizations or cover stories, and to see this faction for what it is. (Greene, 2018)
Group influence
	•	We are all permeable to the influence of the group. What makes us more permeable is our insecurities. The less we are certain about our self-worth as individuals, the more we are unconsciously drawn toward fitting in and blending ourselves into the group spirit. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Your goal in this second task is to maintain as tight a grip on reality as possible. Groups tend to share beliefs and ways of looking at the world that are one-sided. They give greater weight to information that fits into their preconceived notions. They exaggerate qualities of rivals or enemies. They become overoptimistic about their plans. Taken far enough, the group can hold beliefs that are quite delusionary, and its actions can border on madness. Observing the group with a degree of distance will help you be aware of the distorting effect on your perception that can come from being so embedded within a group. Your strategies and decisions will be all the more effective for this. (Greene, 2018)
Group intelligence
	•	What we need more than anything is group intelligence. This intelligence includes a thorough understanding of the effect that groups have on our thinking and emotions; with such awareness, we can resist the downward pull. It also includes understanding how human groups operate according to certain laws and dynamics, which can make it easier to navigate through such spaces. With such intelligence, we can do a delicate dance—we can become gifted social actors and outwardly fit in, while inwardly maintaining some distance and some mental space to think for ourselves. With this degree of independence, we can make decisions in life that are appropriate to who we are and our circumstances. (Greene, 2018)
Group interest
	•	Society is made up of an almost infinite number of groups, whose various interests and desires overlap and interweave inextricably. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
Group network
	•	networks try to explain how a set of isolated elements are transformed, through a pattern of interactions, into groups and communities. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
Group order
	•	The order of a group is the number of elements that it contains.  (Stewart, 2013)
Group pressure
	•	Individuals tend to be vulnerable to social contagion or peer pressure. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Groups tend to encourage members toward reckless behaviour as long as the majority is unaffected (“peer pressure”). (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Groups naturally provide members with the sense of shared risks, collective protection, and cohesion. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Groups can exploit any of these effects by actively encouraging recklessness in return for membership or credibility withtin the group. On the other hand, where the group is risk sensitive but a new member is risk insensitive, the group would encourage the member to conform to the group. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	The first and primary effect on you in any group is the desire to fit in and cement your sense of belonging. The more you fit in, the less you pose a challenge to the group and its values. This will minimize the scrutiny you face and the anxiety that comes with it. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Stemming from this first effect is the second effect—in the group setting, we are always performing. It is not just that we conform in appearances and thinking but that we exaggerate our agreement and show others that we belong. In the group, we become actors, molding what we say and do so that others accept and like us and see us as loyal team members. Our performances change depending on the size of the group and its particular makeup—bosses or colleagues or friends. We might begin with a degree of inner distance in these performances, aware, for instance, that we are being unusually obsequious around the boss. But over time, in acting the part we begin to feel what we are showing; the inner distance melts away, and the mask we wear fuses into our personality. Instead of thinking to smile in appropriate moments, we automatically paste on the smile. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Those who sulk and refuse to perform end up marginalized, as the group unconsciously expels such types. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Pour s’en donner les moyens, il a recours à des opérateurs dont on peut décrire deux types essentiels : les forces de pression et les forces de répression. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Les premières revêtent, pour la plupart, la forme des organisations sociales. (Mannoni, 1985)
Group rules
	•	These rules and codes are never written down but are implicit. Violate them in some way and you risk becoming a nonentity or even being fired, without necessarily knowing the cause. In this way, the group imposes its own orderwithout the need for active policing. The codes will regulate acceptable appearances, how much free talk is encouraged in meetings, the quality of obedience in relation to bosses, the expected work ethic, et cetera. (Greene, 2018)
	•	There are inevitably sacred cows within the group—people or beliefs never to be criticized. Consider all of these as trip wires you must avoid at all costs. Sometimes a particular member of higher standing serves as the de facto policeman or policewoman for these rules and codes. Identify such individuals and avoid any friction with them. It’s not worth it. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Most people intuitively sense the rules and codes of behavior in the group. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Gaining a deeper appreciation of the culture and codes will make it much easier to navigate the social space and maintain a degree of detachment. You will not try to change what cannot be changed. When it comes to the inevitable factions that emerge, it is better to keep yourself unaligned and let others fight over you. You do not need to belong to a faction to derive a narcissistic boost. What you want within the group is strategic options and room to maneuver, to have many allies and widen your power base. (Greene, 2018)
Group setting
	•	We have a side to our character that we are generally unaware of —our social personality, the different person we become when we operate in groups of people. In the group setting, we unconsciously imitate what others are saying and doing. We think differently, more concerned with fitting in and believing what others believe. We feel different emotions, infected by the group mood. We are more prone to taking risks, to acting irrationally, because everyone else is. This social personality can come to dominate who we are. Listening so much to others and conforming our behavior to them, we slowly lose a sense of our uniqueness and the ability to think for ourselves. The only solution is to develop self-awareness and a superior understanding of the changes that occur in us in groups. With such intelligence, we can become superior social actors, able to outwardly fit in and cooperate with others on a high level, while retaining our independence and rationality. (Greene, 2018)
	•	when people operate in groups, they do not engage in nuanced thinking and deep analysis. Only individuals with a degree of calmness and detachment can do so. People in groups feel emotional and excited. Their primary desire is to fit in to the group spirit. Their thinking tends to be simplistic—good versus evil, with us or against us. They naturally look for some type of authority to simplify matters for them. Deliberatelycreating chaos, as Mao did, only makes the group more certain to fall into these primitive patterns of thinking, since it is too frightening for humans to live with too much confusion and uncertainty. (Greene, 2018)
Pathological group behaviour
	•	on peut dire qu’ils répondent aux grands paroxysms émotionnels. On y trouve toutes les expressions comportementales de la peur e de la colère développées à l’extrême. (Mannoni, 1985)
Quotient group 
	•	Formally, a quotient group can be defined as a special kind of partition of the group: a way to chop it into disjoint pieces. (Stewart, 2013)
Reality group
	•	Just as groups tend to exert a downward pull on our emotions and behavior, we can also experience or imagine the opposite—a group that exerts an upward pull. We shall call this ideal the reality group. It consists of members who feel free to contribute their diverse opinions, whose minds are open, and whose focus is on getting work done and cooperating on a high level. By maintaining your individual spirit andyour grip on reality, you will help create or enrich this ideal team of people. (Greene, 2018)
	•	What creates a functional, healthy dynamic is the ability of the group to maintain a tight relationship to reality. The reality for a group is as follows: It exists in order to get things done, to make things, to solve problems. It has certain resources it can draw upon—the labor and strengths of its members, its finances. It operates in a particular environment that is almost always highly competitive and constantlychanging. The healthy group puts primary emphasis on the work itself, on getting the most out of its resources and adapting to all of the inevitable changes. Not wasting time on endless political games, such a group can accomplish ten times more than the dysfunctional variety. It brings out the best in human nature—people’s empathy, their ability to work with others on a high level. It remains the ideal for all of us. We shall call this ideal the reality group. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Certainly, a true reality group is a rare occurrence in history. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Instill a collective sense of purpose. That social force that compels people to want to belong and to fit in you want to capture and channel for a higher purpose. You accomplish this by establishing an ideal— your group has a definite purpose, a positive mission that unites its members. This could be creating a product that is superior and unique, that makes life easier or brings pleasure; or improving conditions for those in need; or solving some seemingly intractable problem. This is the ultimate reality of the group, why it was formed in the first place. This purpose is not vague or implied but clearly stated and publicized. No matter the type of work, you want to emphasize excellence and creating something of the highest possible quality. Making money or being successful should be a natural result of this ideal and not the goal itself. (Greene, 2018)
	•	the group must practice what you preach. Any signs of hypocrisy or noticeable discrepancy between the ideal and the reality will destroy your efforts. You want to establish a track record ofresults that reflect the group’s ideal. Groups will tend to lose connection to their original purpose, particularly with any success. You want to keep reminding the group of its mission, adapting it if necessary but never drifting from this core. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Making people feel an integral part of a group creating something important satisfies a deep yet rarely met human need. Once members experience this, they are motivated to keep the healthy dynamic alive and vital. With its relatively high esprit de corps, the group will police itself. People who are petty and all about ego will stand out and be isolated. With clarity about what the group represents and the role they are to play, members are less likely to form factions. Everything becomes easier and smoother if you instill this collective purpose. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Assemble the right team of lieutenants. As the leader of a reality group, you need the ability to focus on the larger picture and the overall goals that matter. You have only so much mental energy, and you must marshal it wisely. (Greene, 2018)
	•	What you need to do from the outset is to cultivate a team of lieutenants, imbued with your spirit and the collective sense of purpose, whom you can trust to manage the execution of ideas. To achieve this, you must have the right standards—you do not base your selection on people’s charm, and never hire friends. You want the most competent person for the job. You also give great consideration to their character. (Greene, 2018)
	•	You select for this team people who have skills that you lack, each individual with their particular strengths. They know their roles. You also want this team of lieutenants to be diverse in temperament, background, and ideas. They show a willingness to speak up and take initiative, all within the framework of the group’s purpose. They caneven challenge some rules that seem outdated. Feeling a part of a team but able to bring their own creativity to the tasks will bring out the best in them, and this spirit will spread throughout the group. (Greene, 2018)
	•	For this team of lieutenants, and for the group as a whole, you want to make sure that members are treated more or less equally—no one has special privileges; rewards and punishments are doled out fairly and evenly. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Let information and ideas flow freely. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Consider the open communication of ideas and information—about rivals, about what is happening on the streets or among your audience—the lifeblood of the group. (Greene, 2018)
	•	To achieve this, you want to encourage frank discussion up and down the line, with members trusting that they can do so. You listen to your foot soldiers. You want your meetings to be lively, with people not overly concerned about bruising egos and causing offense; you want a diversity of opinions. To allow for such openness, you must be carefulin these discussions to not signal your own preference for a particular option or decision, as this will subtly tip the team into following your lead. Even bring in experts and outsiders to broaden the group’s perspective. (Greene, 2018)
	•	You also want to establish as much transparency as possible: when decisions are made, you share with the team how they came about and for what purpose. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Extend this open communication to the ability for the group to criticize itself and its performance, particularly after any mistakes or failures. Try to turn this into a positive and lively experience, with the focus not on scapegoats but on the overall functioning of the group, which was not up to par. You want the group to keep learning and improving. Learning from mistakes will make the team that much more confident moving forward. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Infect the group with productive emotions. In the group setting, people are naturally more emotional and permeable to the moods of others. You must work with human nature and turn this into a positive by infecting the group with the proper set of emotions. People are more susceptible to the moods and attitudes of the leader than of anyone else. Productive emotions would include calmness. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Infect the group with a sense of resolution that emanates from you. You are not upset by setbacks; you keep advancing and working on problems. You are persistent. The group senses this, and individuals feel embarrassed for becoming hysterical over the slightest shift in fortune. You can try to infect the group with confidence, but be careful that this does not slip into grandiosity. Your confidence and that of the group mostly stems from a successful track record. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Most important, showing a lack of fear and an overall openness to new ideas will have the most therapeutic effect of all. The members will become less defensive, which encourages them to think more on their own, and not operate as automatons. (Greene, 2018)
	•	In the end, you want a group that has been through a few wars, dealt with them reasonably well, and now is battle-tested. They do not wilt at the sign of new obstacles and in fact welcome them. With such a group, you can slowly expand the limits of what you can ask of them, and the members feel a powerful upward pull to meet challenges and prove themselves. Such a group can move mountains. (Greene, 2018)
	•	in a high-functioning reality group, we can make ourselves healthy and whole. Such experiences are memorable and life-changing. We learn the value of cooperating on a higher level, of seeing our fate as intertwined with those around us. We develop greater empathy. We gain confidence in our own abilities, which such a group rewards. We feel connected to reality. We are brought into the upward pull of the group, realizing our social nature on the high level it was intended for. It is our duty as enlightened humans to create as many such groups as possible, making society healthier in the process. (Greene, 2018)
Growth
Exponential growth
	•	on average a small uncertainty will grow exponentially fast in a chaotic system.  (Smith and Smith, 2007)
	•	exponential is much faster than linear growth. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
	•	The numbers in the series 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 . . . are called Fibonacci numbers (Fibonacci was a nickname of Leonardo of Pisa), and they arise again and again in nature: in the structure of sunflowers, pine cones, and pineapples. They are of interest here because they illustrate exponential growth in time, almost. (Smith and Smith, 2007).
	•	exponential curve is special in mathematics because it reflects a function whose increase is proportional to its current value. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
	•	A small error in the initial number of rabbits results in a very large error in the forecast. In fact, the error is growing exponentially in time. This has many implications. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
	•	Now reducing the uncertainty in a measurement is rarely free (we have to hire someone else to count the rabbits a second time), and large reductions of uncertainty can be expensive, so when uncertainty grows exponentially fast, the cost sky-rockets. (Smith and Smith, 2007).
Linear growth
	•	exponential is much faster than linear growth. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
Groupthink
	•	‘groupthink’ decision-making theory, developed in relation to foreign policy failures, suggests that pressures to achieve consensus within small cohesive groups leads to sometimes catastrophic disregard, or misinterpretation, of danger signals that conflict with the basic set of working assumptions of those groups (Janis 1972: pp. 197 – 198). (Rothstein, 2003)
	•	Past experience shows that it is exceedingly difficult to avoid premature closure and “groupthink” unless the analyst employs a specific tool or technique. Simply sensitizing analysts to the variety of analytic traps they are most likely to encounter rarely prevents them from falling into those traps. (Pherson, 2009)
	•	a usually subconscious preference for group consensus favoring agreement among group members and subtly discouraging alternative views and interpretations, which are often seen as efforts to disrupt the consensus the other members desire. (Artner et al., 2016)
Guarantors
	•	Guarantors promise to cover our negative returns. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Guarantors could be as simple as a relative who promises to help out if our business fails or as authoritative as a government that promises to pay “benefits”/“entitlements” if we lose our jobs or become too ill to work. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	guarantors sometimes choose not to honor their commitments. (Newsome, 2013)
Guerrilleros
	•	The Guerrilleros like the soldiers of the French Revolutionary armies in large part applied ancien régime Small War tactics, but the extent of the uprising, the involvement of untrained soldiers and their own cause that they were fighting for gave the whole enterprise a different, larger dimension. (Heuser, 2010a)
Guidelines
Flexible guidelines
	•	Flexibility can be introduced by the incorporation of default options. The assessor would be instructed to use a designated (default) option unless specific scientific evidence suggested otherwise. The guidelines would thus permit exceptions to the general case, as long as each exception could be justified scientifically. (National Research Council (U.S.) et al., 2009)
	•	Guidelines could profitably highlight subjects undergoing relatively rapid scientific development (for example, the use of metabolic data for interspecies comparisons) and any other components in which exceptions to particular default options were likely to arise. They should also attempt to present criteria for evaluating whether an exception is justified. (National Research Council (U.S.) et al., 2009)
Rigid guidelines
	•	Rigid guidelines, which permit no variation, might preclude the consideration of relevant scientific information peculiar to a particular chemical and thus force assessors to use inference options that are not appropriate in a given case. (National Research Council (U.S.) et al., 2009)
	•	Also, rigid guidelines might mandate the continued use of concepts that become obsolete with new scientific developments. (National Research Council (U.S.) et al., 2009)
Guilt
	•	You may also experience feelings of guilt, which is anger turned inward on yourself. (Kübler-Ross and Kessler, 2005)
H
Habitus
	•	habitus. This describes the social field in which individuals compete for legitimacy (Douglas, 2005:134)
Habits
	•	Confidence without Self-awareness and control can become grandiosity. Without conscious effort, these strengths will tend to wear down or turn into weaknesses. What this means is that the weakest parts of our character are the ones that create habits and compulsive behavior, because they do not require effort or practice to maintain. (Greene, 2018)
	•	go into the slow formation of your character. (Greene, 2018)
	•	If people improved their diet and their exercise habits, this would have a beneficial effect on all of the organs, because the body is an interconnected whole. (Greene, 2018)
Habits standardization
	•	The tendency the group has to standardize the habits of individuals and to assign logical reasons for them is an important factor in the work of the public relations counsel. The predominant point of view, according to Mr. Trotter, which translates a rationalized point of view into an axiomatic truth, arises and derives its strength from the fact that it enlists herd support for the point of view of the individual. This explains why it is so easy to popularize many ideas. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	“The cardinal quality of the herd is the homogeneity.”3 The biological significance of homogeneity lies in its survival value. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	These results of homogeneity have created the “herd” point of view. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	One of the psychological results of homogeneity is the fact that physical loneliness is a real terror to the gregarious animal, and that association with the herd causes a feeling of security. In man this fear of loneliness creates a desire for identification with the herd in matters of opinion. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	Each one of us in his opinions and his conduct, in matters of amusement, religion, and politics, is compelled to obtain the support of a class, of a herd within the herd.” (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	“The effect of it will clearly be to make acceptable those suggestions which come from the herd, and those only. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
Halo effect
	•	halo effect—when we see certain negative or positive qualities in a person (social awkwardness, intelligence), other positive or negative qualities are implied that fit with this. People who are good-looking generally seem more trustworthy, particularly politicians. If a person is successful, we imagine they are probably also ethical, conscientious, and deserving of their good fortune. This obscures the fact that many people who have gotten ahead have done so through. (Greene, 2018)
Hallucination
	•	La création des légendes qui circulent si aisément dans les foules n'est pas déterminée seulement par une crédulité complète. Elle l'est encore par les déformations prodigieuses que subissent les événements dans l'imagination de gens assemblés. L'événement le plus simple vu par la foule est bientôt un événement transformé. Elle pense par images, et l'image évoquée en évoque elle-même une série d'autres n'ayant aucun lien logique avec la première. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	La raison nous montre ce que dans ces images il y a d'incohérence, mais la foule ne le voit guère; et ce que son imagination déformante ajoute à l'événement réel, elle le confondra avec lui. La foule ne sépare guère le subjectif de l'objectif. Elle admet comme réelles les images évoquées dans son esprit, et qui le plus souvent n'ont qu'une parenté lointaine avec le fait observé. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Dans cet exemple on voit se dérouler bien clairement le mécanisme de l'hallucination collective tel que nous l'avons expliqué. D'un côté, une foule en état d'attention expectante; de l'autre, une suggestion faite par la vigie signalant un bâtiment désemparé en mer, suggestion qui, par voie de contagion, fut acceptée par tous les assistants, officiers ou matelots. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Dès que quelques individus sont réunis, ils constituent une foule, et, alors même qu'ils seraient des savants distingués, ils prennent tous les caractères des foules pour ce qui est en dehors de leur spécialité. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	le point de départ de la suggestion est toujours l'illusion produite chez un individu par des réminiscences plus ou moins vagues, puis la contagion par voie d'affirmation de cette illusion primitive. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Ce que l'observateur voit alors, ce n'est plus l'objet lui-même, mais l'image évoquée dans son esprit. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	observations collectives sont les plus erronées de toutes et que le plus souvent elles représentent simplement l'illusion d'un individu qui, par voie de contagion, a suggestionné les autres. (Lebon, 1895)
Happiness
	•	On est toujours pressé d'être heureux, monsieur Danglars, car lorsqu'on a souffert longtemps on a grand-peine à croire au bonheur.  (Dumas, 1998)
	•	« Allons donc, dit-il, est-ce que vous craindriez quelque chose  ? il me semble, au contraire, que tout va selon vos désirs  ! – Et c'est justement cela qui m'épouvante, dit Dantès, il me semble que l'homme n'est pas fait pour être si facilement heureux  ! Le bonheur est comme ces palais des îles enchantées dont les dragons gardent les portes. Il faut combattre pour le conquérir, et moi, en vérité, je ne sais en quoi j'ai mérité le bonheur d'être le mari de Mercédès. (Dumas, 1998)
	•	heureux, qui peut dire cela  ? Le malheur ou le bonheur, c'est le secret des murailles ; les murailles ont des oreilles, mais elles n'ont pas de langue ; si l'on est heureux avec une grande fortune, Danglars est heureux. (Dumas, 1998)
	•	– Mais vous êtes heureux, maintenant  ? – Sans doute, répondit le comte, car personne ne m'entend me plaindre. (Dumas, 1998)
Harlequin
	•	Il paraît que, comme Arlequin, j'ai dit la vérité en riant. (Dumas, 1998)
Hashish
	•	Justement, vous avez dit le mot, seigneur Aladin, c'est du haschich, tout ce qui se fait de meilleur et de plus pur en haschich à Alexandrie, du haschich d'Abougor, le grand faiseur, l'homme unique, l'homme à qui l'on devrait bâtir un palais avec cette inscription : Au marchand du bonheur, le monde reconnaissant.  (Dumas, 1998)
Hatred
Vehement hatred
	•	behind any vehement hatred is often a secret and very unpalatable envy of the hated person or people. It is only through such hate that it can be released from the unconscious in some form. (Greene, 2018)
Hazard vs risk debate
	•	The “hazard vs risk” debate evokes other classic themes of risk regulation characterised by a dichotomy structure, such as “lay people vs expert judgment” and “science vs other legitimate factors”. (Alemanno, 2011)
	•	the debate over “hazard versus risk” cannot escape a EU decision-making system where the concerns stemming from hazard classi cation can legally override the outcome of the evidence-based risk assessment procedures. (Alemanno, 2011)
	•	One of the main reasons for this lengthy debate is the fact that we have had a slack and easygoing regulation in force during a period when a hundred thousand new chemicals arrived on the market, with little or no knowledge of the risks and hazards of exposure. This has created a political headache now that the  ow of scientific studies has slowly put the jigsaw puzzle together, revealing that we are all heavily exposed to hazardous chemicals in our daily life. (Forsberg, 2011)
	•	The debate around risk versus hazard is an important one. As Professor Lofstedt notes, these are not contradictory concepts, but rather build on each other. Hazard and the intrinsic capacity of a substance to cause harm is the starting point. The debate then centers on to what extent a risk assessment (taking actual or potential exposure into account) should be made before the uses of the substance in question are regulated. (Nordlander, 2011)
Hazards
	•	Hazards can be defined in terms of combinations of system properties and/or events that may lead to undesired consequences. (IEA Greenhouse Gas R&D Programme, 2009)
	•	A hazard has the potential to cause harm. This can take the form of death, ill health and injury to people; damage to property, plant, products or the environment; production losses; business harm and increased liabilities. (Wells, 1996)
	•	Hazard and risk are used interchangeably in everyday vocabulary. Nevertheless, it has proved useful to HSE to make a conceptual distinction between a ‘hazard’ and a ‘risk’. (Great Britain and Health and Safety Executive, 2001)
	•	a hazard as the potential for harm arising from an intrinsic property or disposition of something to cause detriment. (Great Britain and Health and Safety Executive, 2001)
	•	The concepts of hazard and risk are enshrined in our everyday vocabulary. (Great Britain and Health and Safety Executive, 2001)
	•	‘Hazards’ describe the potential for harm or other consequences of interest. (Renn, 2007a)
	•	hazards characterize the inherent properties of the risk agent and related processes (Renn, 2007a)
	•	The view that risks and hazards are distinct concepts is commonly held in the scholarly literature on risk especially in the English-speaking community. The dichotomy is also enshrined in key documents commissioned or developed by Governments to help regulators conceptualise, regulate and communicate harmful events. (Bouder, 2011)
	•	The potential to harm a target such as the health of a human being is normally de ned as a “hazard”. (Renn, 2011)
	•	The term “hazard” only takes into account the trigger of the risk and concentrates on the possible damage potential. (Renn, 2011)
	•	Hazard is mostly treated as a non-quantitative concept. (Swedish Chemicals Agency et al., 2007)
	•	Hazards and threats are the sources of negative risks. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	The hazard is the source in a harmless state (such as a river remote to you). (Newsome, 2013)
	•	The hazard and threats are sources of the risk in the sense that they are the actual actors or agents with the potential to harm, while the risk is the potential harm. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	A hazard is a potential, dormant, absent, or contained threat. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Hazard and threat are different states of the same thing: The hazard is in a harmless state, the threat in a harmful state. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	The hazard would do no harm unless it were to change into a threat. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Hazard become threats when we are coincident with, enable, or activate the harmful state. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	The hazard is the source of the event and of the associated risk, but it is not the same as an event or a risk. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	The hazard is a harmless state with potential to change into threat. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Hazard and threat are different states of the same thing. Concepts that explain a hazard’s transition to threat include activation, coincidence, enablement ,and release from containment, as described in the subsections below. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	A hazard is not forgettable – the hazard could become a threat, so the risk manager must often choose a strategy for keeping the source in its hazardous state. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Hazards remain hazards to us so long as we avoid activating the hazard, avoiding exposing ourselves to the hazard, control enablers, or contain the hazard. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	The hazard can be controlled by simply not activating it, which is usually less burdensome than terminating the hazard. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Hazards sometimes are unable to harm us, but other actors could enable the hazard by providing new intents or capabilities. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Hazards can be contained in physical ways. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Hazards can be contained in behavioral ways too. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	[…] in theory, hazards and threats are on a continuous scale. Anything could be considered hazardous or threatening to some degree. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Hazard has no clear antonym, something like a sympathetic neutral, absent friend, well-wisher, hero, or angel. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Although hazard has an overwhelmingly negative connotation, the same source, depending on the situation, could become a threat or an ally, so analytically we should be justified to consider a hazard with both negative and positive potential. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	[…] hazard is a potential threat. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Hazard is a condition or circumstance that increases the chance of losses orgains and their severity. (Tchankova, 2002)
Hazard assessment
	•	hazard assessment and risk assessment are not mutually exclusive. (Lofstedt, 2011)
	•	hazard assessments are quicker and cheaper to implement, but in the long term they can have significant consequences as they tend to ignore risk-risk tradeoffs. (Lofstedt, 2011) 
	•	hazard assessments might be easier, quicker, cheaper, and give a (sometimes false) sense of highest protection. (Nordlander, 2011)
	•	Hazard assessment is generally understood as a constituent part of risk assessment, but is not in itself suf cient to trigger regulation. (Zander, 2011)
	•	Hazard and threat assessments are widely required, but widely dissastisfying. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Often a hazard or threat is assessed by its associated risk, which would be a conflation of concepts. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Hazard and threat assessment are typically dissatisfying also because they usually focus on either threat or hazard and neglect the other. Hazards rarely are assessed discreetly. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Threat assessments and risks assessment are more common but often lack realism without assessments of the hazards and of how easily the hazards could be activated as threats. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	The final part of a hazard assessment should focus on how easy the hazard would be to activate as a threat, leaving a later part of the assessment to focus on how threatening it would be if activated. Most threat assessment actually assess only the potential harm and rarely assess the actual potential for a threat to arise from a particular hazard. (Newsome, 2013)
Hazard classication
	•	From an economics perspective, decision making on the basis of just hazard classication usually ignores impact assessment, which is a distinct factor and in so doing often contributes to poor regulatory policy-making. (Lofstedt, 2011)
	•	The use of hazard classifications for the setting of regulation has been around for several hundreds of years. It served as a basis for setting chemical control laws in Sweden in 1756, for example, and has been increasingly used in Europe during the second half of the 20th century, including the 1967 European Council Directive (67/548/EEC) on labelling, classifying and packaging dangerous substances and the 1973 Swedish Act on hazardous chemical products. (Lofstedt, 2011)
	•	In recent years hazard classifications have increased in popularity within the environmental arena where it is used in some European Member States as a reason to ban certain chemicals and metals on the basis that they are endocrine disruptive, bio-accumulative or cause cancer. (Lofstedt, 2011)
	•	regulators find that hazard classifications are cost effective and efficient for banning entire lines of chemicals. (Lofstedt, 2011)
	•	One of the main problems with hazard classfications are that they are only one initial part of the risk analysis process. That is to say, policy makers can take the decision to ban certain chemicals and metals on the assumption or idea that they may be hazardous without testing whether this is actually the case.  (Lofstedt, 2011)
	•	1910.1200(d)(2) Chemical manufacturers, importers or employers classifying chemicals shall identify and consider the full range of available scientific literature and other evidence concerning the potential hazards. There is no requirement to test the chemical to determine how to classify its hazards. Appendix A to § 1910.1200 shall be consulted for classification of health hazards, and Appendix B to § 1910.1200 shall be consulted for the classification of physical hazards. (United States Department of Labor, 2012)
	•	Hazard classification means an indication of the intrinsic hazardous properties of substances and mixtures. It involves:a. identification of relevant data regarding the hazards of a substance or mixture;b. subsequent review of those data to ascertain the hazards associated with the substance or mixture; and c. a decision on whether the substance or mixture will be classfied as a hazardous substance or mixture and the degree of hazard, where appropriate, by comparison of the data with agreed hazard classi cation criteria. (Safe Work Australia, 2012) 
	•	regulators who wish to develop hazard- based regulation, for example to avoid lengthy risk analysis procedures and save time/money need to pay attention to the downsides of this approach. (Bouder, 2011)
	•	According to Lofstedt, hazard assessments suffer from the fact that they are not as scientific as risk assessments (pp. 153–154). (Jørgensen, 2011)
	•	Hazard assessments can therefore be criticized for being unscientifc because they only take into account the properties of a given chemical and not the actual risk that it poses to humans and the environment. (Jørgensen, 2011)
	•	today, it is more hazard classification and less risk assessment. (Alemanno, 2011)
	•	is based on the potential for a substance, activity or process to cause harm or an adverse effect. (Aven, 2014)
	•	the potential for something to cause harm. (Olofsson, 2014)
	•	Hazard Classification forms an appropriate basis for the various global, regional and national classification, packaging and labelling schemes. (Royal Society of Chemistry, 2014)
Classification of hazards
	•	The six categories I would point to are: 1. infectious and degenerative diseases; 2. "natural" catastrophes; 3. failure of large technological systems; 4. discrete, small-scale accidents; 5. low-level, delayed-effect hazards; and 6. sociopolitical disruptions. Obviously these overlap. (Lowrance, 1980)
Hazard indices 
	•	Hazard indices are important tools in the work for inherent safety in the chemical industry. (Swedish Chemicals Agency et al., 2007)
	•	Several hazard indices have been constructed for judging the inherent safety of a chemical plant. (Swedish Chemicals Agency et al., 2007)
	•	The indices are, generally speaking, less reliable for toxicity assessment than for the assessment of fire and explosion hazards. (Swedish Chemicals Agency et al., 2007)
Chemical hazards
	•	include acidity, alkalinity, corrosively, explosiveness, flammability, reactivity, toxicity and asphyxiation (Wells, 1996)
	•	absolute safety in the control of a chemical hazard is not achievable. (Swedish Chemicals Agency et al., 2007)
Thermodynamic hazards
	•	include high pressure and vacuum, heat transfer, high and low temperature and fluid jets (Wells, 1996)
Electrical and electromagnetic hazards
	•	include high voltage, radiation, static electricity and electrical current (Wells, 1996)
Mechanical hazards
	•	include mechanical energy, stresses, forces and impact blows and contact laceration (Wells, 1996)
Health hazards
	•	include noise, pollutants, chemicals, vibration, radioactivity and temperature extremes (Wells, 1996)
Hazard control
	•	Hazard controls should be designed to minimize the probability of occurrence of initiating events and their propagation into undisred events. (Wells, 1996)
Hazard analysis
	•	In order to reduce residual risk it is common to use hazard analysis to study a system to identify applicable hazards and their possible consequences. (Wells, 1996)
	•	A hazard analysis involves the identification of undesired or adverse event that lead to the materialization of a hazard, the analysis of the mechanisms by which theses undesired event could occur and usually the estimation of the extent, magnitude and likelihood of any harmful effects. In theory it is applied only to the identification of hazards and the consequences of the credible accident sequences of each hazard. (Wells, 1996)
	•	The principal methods used for hazard and risk analysis are quasi-formal techniques designed to facilities the process of hazard identification and risk evaluation by directing the thought process of the analysis along certain lines. (Wells, 1996)
	•	Concept Hazard Analysis is primarily concerned with identifying the main hazards with a new process design. (Wells, 1996)
Hazard reduction
	•	Hazard reduction can then be applied to eliminate some hazards or at least mitigate against their consequences to an extent that is comparable with project and manufacturing objectives incorporating the general safety objectives and policies of the company. (Wells, 1996)
	•	The general stages in hazard reduction involve: the identification of hazards and hazardous conditions; the identification of the incident scenario; hazard review and determination of consequences; assessment of risk; reduction of the potential consequences of accident; reduction of the frequency of occurrence of major accidents; reduction of the frequency of occurrence of major accidents; control of external threats and unplanned change; attention to organization, management, training, procedures, information, etc; implementation, assessment and continued vigilance. (Wells, 1996)
Concept hazard analysis
	•	Concept Hazard Analysis (CHA) is used for the identification of hazards and hazardous conditions; The primary aim is to identify areas which are recognized as being particular dangerous from incidents in the past, not necessarily involving the same process. It also identifies the need to explore any difficulties which might be experienced with unwanted reactions. Elimination or reduction of the hazard is a primary objective, because doing this at an early stage of the design is particularly cost-effective. The method can be used to help determine the suitability of the planed site and the acceptability of a particular process route, bearing in mind process safety and the green policies of the company. It may be used to guide selection of hazard control systems. (Wells, 1996)
	•	CHA is mainly used during ‘conceptual engineering’, which involved the tehnical and economic evaluation of a project’s feasibility including process route, process chemistry, hazard identification, block flow and initial process flow diagrams, fundamental design basis for equipment, maximum intended inventory, control and possibly emergency control, plot plans and site selection. Variants of the method are also recommended for use during ‘initial project review’ and during ‘basic engineering’. (Wells, 1996)
	•	CHA essentially involves a number of people sitting down at a meeting at which basic information is available about the process. (Wells, 1996)
	•	CHA is poor at identifying the immediate and root causes of incidents. It is not good at checking out the control system. It can be used for a general discussion on whether the company has the organization and management support to carry out such a project and run the plant, given the level of management and manpower competence for this type of process. It can recognize the impact of the proposed plant on the status of the site with respect to national regulatory control and consents for effluents and so on. When it comes to details, however, more powerful methods must be used.  Only crude estimates can be made of the risk of damage and would probably be carried out suing hazard indices. (Wells, 1996)
Hazard function
	•	hazard function above as being the appropriate statistical concept that captures the epidemiologic idea of an incidence rate. (Moolgavkar and Leubeck, 2002)
Development hazard
	•	To understand the developmental hazard, one must gen- erally consider the phannacokinetics of the specific chemical. (Paustenbach, 2002a)
Hidden hazard
	•	A corollary to the argument that hazards generate different signal strengths is the proposition that some can be hidden by the process of attenuation. This is a very interesting and useful notion. (Breakwell, 2014)
	•	five aspects of such hazards that motivate attenuation (Breakwell, 2014)
Global elusive hazards 
	•	involve a series of complex problems (inter- national interactions, long time lags, diffuse effects, etc.) and their signal power is muted in many societies by the inequalities and fragmentation between nations and cultures. (Breakwell, 2014)
Ideological hazards 
	•	lie embedded in a system of beliefs and values that attenuates the consequences of the hazard. (Breakwell, 2014)
Marginal hazards 
	•	affect people who are at the margins of society, who have little power, and whose problems are not a focus of attention for mainstream society. (Breakwell, 2014)
Amplification-driven hazards 
	•	occur as a secondary consequence of other hazards and exist below the threshold of recognition (this can of course be a temporary phase in the life of a hazard). (Breakwell, 2014)
Value-threatening hazards
	•	alter lifestyles and basic values but are not recognised because societal attention is elsewhere (e.g. concerned with what are considered to be more important issues, such as conflicts, profit and physical survival). (Breakwell, 2014)

Hazard sequences
	•	This is a simple notion: any one risk event is often represented or conceptualised as part of a sequence of risk events that share common features. (Breakwell, 2014)
Hazard templates 
	•	when a new risk event occurs, the way it will be represented will be determined by the ‘templates’ that already exist for the representation of that type of risk. (Breakwell, 2014)
	•	The template will provide a ready-made phrase to be used about it. It will provide common explanations for the origin of the risk event, the individuals, groups or institutions who should be held responsible, the forms of remedial or punishment action that should be taken, etc. (Breakwell, 2014)
	•	The form of the template is roughly common across hazards, but the substantive content will differ widely. (Breakwell, 2014)
	•	These templates are commonly used by the mass media to structure their stories but they are also the frameworks that lay people use when they come to talk about a new risk event. They appear to have a risk vocabulary and rhetoric that is built upon understandings and expectations of the way different hazards work. (Breakwell, 2014)
	•	Breakwell and Barnett (2001) note that the same template will often be used for different hazards identified to be part of a sequence. (Breakwell, 2014)
	•	Where a hazard template is initially absent, as in the case of a complete novel risk, it can be anticipated that the hazard may be linked to older, partially relevant templates. Over time, it will evolve its own. It is possible that before a template is established attenuation of the risk may occur. If not ‘active’ attenuation, it may be that passive attenuation through absence of attention to the hazard occurs. (Breakwell, 2014)
Hazard negotiations 
	•	Following a risk event, all those affected, directly or indirectly, are likely to have something to say about it. While the channels available to them to ‘have their say’ will vary in salience, there will be multitudinous voices. Amplification processes (note: they are taken by Breakwell and Barnett to encompass intensification, attenuation, representation, de-intensification and de- attenuation) will consequently involve the probably simultaneous presentation of varying messages about the risk event. The extent to which they are at variance will inevitably differ across risk events. However, to the extent that the sources of messages are aware that other messages are promulgated, they have the task of responding to these alternatives. This is where the concept of hazard negotiation has a role.(Breakwell, 2014)
	•	When ‘stations’ find that they are broadcasting messages about a risk event that are at variance with each other, there is scope for them to attempt to negotiate a common interpretation or, if this proves impossible, at least to seek a compatible set of interpretations. (Breakwell, 2014)
	•	Creating explanations and generating plans to tackle the crisis required the hazard to be negotiated. (Breakwell, 2014)
Hazard representations
	•	[…] hazard representations of which an individual is aware, will accept and may use will firstly depend upon the significance they have for identity. (Breakwell, 2014)
	•	People think about and respond differently to hazards depending on whether the hazards are forced upon them or are voluntarily undertaken, whether the hazards are known or unknown, controlled or beyond personal agency and influence, and whether they are understood to apply 'in general' or on an individual level. (Boholm, 1996)
Hazard from radioactivity 
	•	The hazard from radioactivity has long been recognised and the need to control its escape to very low levels was one of the first preoccupations of the designers of the first generation of stations. (Great Britain and Health and Safety Executive, 1992)
Positive hazard
	•	Positive hazard is the clearest antonym of negative hazard, just as we differentiate positive and negative risks. (Newsome, 2013)
Natural hazard
	•	A natural hazard is any natural phenomenon of potential harm. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	One explanation for the favouritism toward the term natural hazard over natural threat is that natural agents have no human-like conscious intent. Like all hazards, natural hazards remain hazardous to us as long as we are not vulnerable and exposed, even though the same agents would be threats to anyone who is vulnerable and exposed. (Newsome, 2013)
Material hazards
	•	Material hazards (hazardous materials; HAZMATs) include entirely natural materials, such as fossil fuels, and human-made materials from natural sources such as distilled fuels, that are somehow potentially harmful, such as by toxicity. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Some hazardous materials overlap human-made hazards (described later), such as explosive weapons (which are hazardous in themselves and contain hazardous materials). (Newsome, 2013)
Human hazards
	•	Human hazards are human beings with the potential to threaten. (Newsome, 2013)
Organizational hazards
	•	Organization hazards are organizations with the potential to threaten. (Newsome, 2013)
Health
	•	we must recognize the role that willpower plays in our health. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Our attitude plays an enormous role in our health, one that science has begun to explore and will examine in more depth in the coming decades. In general, you can safely push yourself beyond what you think are your physical limits by feeling excited and challenged by a project or endeavor. (Greene, 2018)
Health insurance
Private health schemes
	•	Private health schemes ensure immediate treatment. (Coker, 2009) 
Health and Safety Commission 
	•	HSC is the statutory body responsible for the administration of the Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974 (HSW Act) and its subsidiary legislation which includes the Nuclear Installations Acts. It is composed of nine members representing employers, employees, local authorities, and the public, and a chairman appointed by the Secretary of State for Employment. In nuclear matters the Commission is advised by the Advisory Committee on the Safety of Nuclear Installations (ACSNI), whose reports are published. ACSNI also advises the Secretaries of State for Trade & lndustry and Scotland who are answerable in Parliament for civil nuclear safety matters. (Great Britain and Health and Safety Executive, 1992)
Health and Safety Executive
	•	HSE is a corporate body of three people appointed by HSC, and has some 4500 employees, mainly inspectors and technical, scientific and medical experts. Its Management Board includes the Chief Inspectors of the various Inspectorates concerned with the enforcement of industrial safety and health. The Executive is the licensing authority for nuclear installations; this function is delegated to the Chief Inspector of Nuclear Installations. (Great Britain and Health and Safety Executive, 1992)
Hedging
	•	‘hedging’, is suitable to address specific and narrowly defined risks. (Frühling, 2014)
	•	Despite the broad and ill-defined use of the term ‘hedging’ in the international security literature, it has avery specific meaning in its original context of finance, on which the use of the term herein is based. (Frühling, 2014)
	•	In finance, ‘hedging’ refers to the reduction of a financial risk through the purchase or selling of a derivative whose value is highly and inversely correlated with that of theunderlying asset. (Frühling, 2014)
	•	hedging is thus very similar to an insurance contract: it is only useful to reduce very specific risks, and the costs associated with it have to be paid up front. These two characteristics are a hedge’s main strength and weakness, since the risk must be well defined, the cost can be substantial, and any mismatch between the hedge and the risk will result in a costlyfailure that can be difficult to unwind. (Frühling, 2014)
	•	Hedging is the legitimate intellectual response to ambiguity, but it can be politically counterproductive if the value of the intelligence is to shock consumers out of wish- fulness and cognitive insensitivity. (Betts, 2007)
Hedging policy
	•	Setting a hedging policy is therefore a strategic decision whose success or failure can make or break the company concerned. (Coker, 2009)
	•	Hedging, in other words, has now been embraced by countries as well as companies. (Coker, 2009)
Hegemony
	•	hegemony is the ultimate aim of every state. (Toft, 2003)
	•	The concept of hegemony is applied both globally and regionally. (Toft, 2003)
	•	“hegemony means domination of the system, which is usually interpreted as the entire world.... it is possible to apply the concept of a system more narrowly and use it to describe particular regions, such as Europe, Northeast Asia, and the Western Hemisphere” (ibid.: 1995: 80 fn. 4 [1990a], 2001a: 40). (Toft, 2003)
Global hegemony
	•	Global hegemony is only possible in the rare case that one state achieves a nuclear monopoly (Toft, 2003)
Regional hegemony
	•	regional hegemony becomes the principal aim of the states (Toft, 2003)
Herd instinct
	•	Of particular interest to Trotter, and to Bernays, was the “herd instinct,” the unceasing need to gain the approval and camaraderie of the social group. The individual Trotter wrote, is “more sensitive to the voice of the herd than to any other influence. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
Hermeneutics
	•	Hermeneutics is the study of interpretation and meaning. It is based on the ontological position that the world is subjective, with epistemological project being to make interpretations of this subjective world. (Davies et al., 2002)
Hero
	•	La création des légendes qui circulent si aisément dans les foules n'est pas déterminée seulement par une crédulité complète. Elle l'est encore par les déformations prodigieuses que subissent les événements dans l'imagination de gens assemblés. L'événement le plus simple vu par la foule est bientôt un événement transformé. Elle pense par images, et l'image évoquée en évoque elle-même une série d'autres n'ayant aucun lien logique avec la première. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	La raison nous montre ce que dans ces images il y a d'incohérence, mais la foule ne le voit guère; et ce que son imagination déformante ajoute à l'événement réel, elle le confondra avec lui. La foule ne sépare guère le subjectif de l'objectif. Elle admet comme réelles les images évoquées dans son esprit, et qui le plus souvent n'ont qu'une parenté lointaine avec le fait observé. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Dans cet exemple on voit se dérouler bien clairement le mécanisme de l'hallucination collective tel que nous l'avons expliqué. D'un côté, une foule en état d'attention expectante; de l'autre, une suggestion faite par la vigie signalant un bâtiment désemparé en mer, suggestion qui, par voie de contagion, fut acceptée par tous les assistants, officiers ou matelots. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Dès que quelques individus sont réunis, ils constituent une foule, et, alors même qu'ils seraient des savants distingués, ils prennent tous les caractères des foules pour ce qui est en dehors de leur spécialité. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	le point de départ de la suggestion est toujours l'illusion produite chez un individu par des réminiscences plus ou moins vagues, puis la contagion par voie d'affirmation de cette illusion primitive. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Ce que l'observateur voit alors, ce n'est plus l'objet lui-même, mais l'image évoquée dans son esprit. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	observations collectives sont les plus erronées de toutes et que le plus souvent elles représentent simplement l'illusion d'un individu qui, par voie de contagion, a suggestionné les autres. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Connaissons-nous un seul mot de vrai concernant la vie des grands hommes qui ont joué les rôles prépondérants dans l'humanité, tels que Hercule, Bouddha, Jésus ou Mahomet? Très probablement non. Au fond d'ailleurs, leur vie réelle nous importe fort peu. Ce que nous avons intérêt à connaître, ce sont les grands hommes tels que la légende populaire les a fabriqués. Ce sont les héros légendaires, et pas du tout les héros réels, qui ont impressionné l'âme des foules. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Il n'est même pas besoin que les siècles aient passé sur les héros pour que leur légende soit transformée par l'imagination des foules. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Sous les Bourbons, Napoléon devint une sorte de personnage idyllique philanthrope et libéral, ami des humbles, qui, au dire des poètes, devaient conserver son souvenir sous le chaume pendant bien longtemps. Trente ans après, le héros débonnaire était devenu un despote sanguinaire qui, après avoir usurpé le pouvoir et la liberté, fit périr trois millions d'hommes uniquement pour satisfaire son ambition. De nos jours, nous assistons à une nouvelle transformation de la légende. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	l'histoire ne peut guère éterniser que des mythes. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Le type du héros cher aux foules aura toujours la structure d'un César. Son panache les séduit, son autorité leur impose et son sabre leur fait peur. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Cette moralisation de l'individu par la foule n'est certes pas une règle constante, mais c'est une règle qui s'observe fréquemment. Elle s'observe même dans des circonstances beaucoup moins graves que celles que je viens de citer. J'ai déjà dit qu'au théâtre la foule veut chez le héros de la pièce des vertus exagérées, et il est d'une observation banale qu'une assistance, même composée d'éléments inférieurs, se montre généralement très prude. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	bien des facteurs peuvent entrer dans la genèse du prestige: un des plus importants fut toujours le succès. Tout homme qui réussit, toute idée qui s'impose, cessent par ce fait même d'être contestés. La preuve que le succès est une des bases principales du prestige, c'est que ce dernier disparaît presque toujours avec lui. Le héros, que la foule acclamait la veille, est conspué par elle le lendemain si l'insuccès l'a frappé. La réaction sera même d'autant plus vive que le prestige aura été plus grand. La foule considère alors le héros tombé comme un égal, et se venge de s'être inclinée devant la supériorité qu'elle ne lui reconnaît plus. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	C'est toujours avec fureur que les croyants brisent les statues de leurs anciens dieux. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Le prestige enlevé par l'insuccès est perdu brusquement. Il peut s'user aussi par la discussion, mais d'une façon plus lente. Ce procédé est cependant d'un effet très sûr. Le prestige discuté n'est déjà plus du prestige. Les dieux et les hommes qui ont su garder longtemps leur prestige n'ont jamais toléré la discussion. Pour se faire admirer des foules, il faut toujours les tenir à distance. (Lebon, 1895)
Heuristics
	•	[…] people rely on a limited number of heuristic principles which reduce the complex tasks of assessing probabilities and predicting values to simpler judgmental operations. In general, these heuristics are quite useful, but sometimes they lead to severe and systematic errors. (Tversky and Kahneman, 1974)
	•	Such biases are also found in the intuitive judgment of probability (Tversky and Kahneman, 1974)
	•	To evaluate the probability of obtaining a particular result in a sample drawn from a specified population, people typically apply the representativeness heuristic. (Tversky and Kahneman, 1974)
	•	The technical definition of heuristic is a simple procedure that helps find adequate, though often imperfect, answers to difficult questions. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	Substitution of questions inevitably produces systematic errors  (Kahneman, 2012)
Representativeness heuristic 
	•	This approach to the judgment of probability leads to serious errors, because similarity, or representativeness, is not influenced by several factors that should affect judgments of probability. (Tversky and Kahneman, 1974)
Misconceptions of regression
	•	We suggest that the phenomenon of regression remains elusive because it is in- compatible with the belief that the predicted outcome should be maximally representative of the input, and, hence, that the value of the outcome variable should be as extreme as the value of the input variable. (Tversky and Kahneman, 1974)
	•	the failure to understand the effect of regression leads one to over- estimate the effectiveness of punishment and to underestimate the effectiveness of reward. (Tversky and Kahneman, 1974)
Availability 
	•	one may evaluate the probability that a given business venture will fail by imagining various difficulties it could encounter. (Tversky and Kahneman, 1974)
	•	availability is affected by factors other than frequency and probability. Consequently, the reliance on availability leads to predictable biases, some of which are illustrated below. (Tversky and Kahneman, 1974)
	•	Availability provides a natural account for the illusory-correlation effect. (Tversky and Kahneman, 1974)
Adjustment
	•	In many situations, people make estimates by starting from an initial value that is adjusted to yield the final answer. The initial value, or starting point, may be suggested by the formulation of the problem, or it may be the result of a partial computation. (Tversky and Kahneman, 1974)

Anchoring
	•	Anchoring occurs not only when the starting point is given to the subject, but also when the subject bases his estimate on the result of some incomplete computation. (Tversky and Kahneman, 1974)
	•	As a consequence of anchoring, the overall probability will be overestimated in conjunctive problems and underestimated in disjunctive problems. (Tversky and Kahneman, 1974)
	•	the direction of the anchoring bias can some- times be inferred from the structure of the event. (Tversky and Kahneman, 1974)
3-D heuristic 
	•	The essential step in the heuristic—the substitution of three-dimensional for two-dimensional size—occurred automatically. The picture contains cues that suggest a 3-D interpretation. These cues are irrelevant to the task at hand—the judgment of size of the figure on the page—and you should have ignored them, but you could not. The bias associated with the heuristic is that objects that appear to be more distant also appear to be larger on the page. (Kahneman, 2012)
Affect heuristic 
	•	The psychologist Paul Slovic has proposed an affect heuristic in which people let their likes and dislikes determine their beliefs about the world. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	affect heuristic, in which people make judgments and decisions by consulting their emotions  (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	The affect heuristic is an instance of substitution, in which the answer to an easy question (How do I feel about it?) serves as an answer to a much harder question (What do I think about it?). (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	
Adjust-and-anchor heuristic 
	•	a strategy for estimating uncertain quantities: start from an anchoring number, assess whether it is too high or too low, and gradually adjust your estimate by mentally “moving” from the anchor. (Kahneman, 2012)
Availability
Availability heuristic
	•	We thought of that heuristic when we asked ourselves what people actually do when they wish to estimate the frequency of a category (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	We defined the availability heuristic as the process of judging frequency by “the ease with which instances come to mind.” (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	The availability heuristic, like other heuristics of judgment, substitutes one question for another. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	availability effects help explain the pattern of insurance purchase and protective action after disasters.  (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	a person with a large battery of available memories or experiences related to a particular outcome will view that outcome as more likely—the more so if the person is influenced by ‘‘memorable events, recent disasters, and even vivid films.’’62 This phenomenon is known in the psychological literature as the availability heuristic. (Weiss, 2008)
Availability cascade
	•	Sunstein and a collaborator, the jurist Timur Kuran, invented a name for the mechanism through which biases flow into policy: the availability cascade. They comment that in the social context, “all heuristics are equal, but availability is more equal than the others.” (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	An availability cascade is a self-sustaining chain of events, which may start from media reports of a relatively minor event and lead up to public panic and large-scale government action. On some occasions, a media story about a risk catches the attention of a segment of the public, which becomes aroused and worried. This emotional reaction becomes a story in itself, prompting additional coverage in the media, which in turn produces greater concern and involvement. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	The danger is increasingly exaggerated as the media compete for attention- grabbing headlines (Kahneman, 2012)
Availability entrepreneurs
	•	The cycle is sometimes sped along deliberately by “availability entrepreneurs,” individuals or organizations who work to ensure a continuous flow of worrying news. (Kahneman, 2012)
Hezbollah
	•	Hezbollah is not a state; it is a deeply entrenched, non-state entity whose logic of operations and concept of rewards and constraints differs radically from that of most states the world over. (Coker, 2009)
	•	Hezbollah is not an army: it is a complex network which includes a sophisticated and well- armed military arm. (Coker, 2009)
	•	it is also a political movement, as well as a state within a state in Lebanon where it is now the country’s largest real-estate owner. (Coker, 2009)
	•	It is a social movement, as well as a Syrian and Iranian ally/proxy, and it has a worldwide visibility that ties it into other movements and interests across the world. (Coker, 2009)
	•	It is the system which should be targeted if the Israelis are ever to weaken its hold on the imagination. (Coker, 2009)
Hierarchy
	•	Hierarchy needs information to flow from bottom up as well as top down (Douglas, 2005:144)
	•	As the most complex social animal on the planet, we humans form elaborate hierarchies based on position, money, and power. We are aware of these hierarchies, but we do not like talking explicitly about relative power positions, and we are generally uncomfortable when others talk about their superior rank. Instead, signs of dominance or weakness are more often expressed in nonverbal communication. We have inherited this communication style from other primates, notably chimpanzees, who have elaborate signals to denote an individual chimp’s place in the social rank. Keep in mind that the feeling of being in a superior social position gives people a confidence that will radiate outward in their body language. Some feel this confidence before they attain a position of power, and it becomes a Self-fulfilling prophecy as others are drawn to them. Some who are ambitious might try to simulate these cues, but it has to be done well. Fake confidence can be quite off-putting. (Greene, 2018)
Hierarchical organization
	•	Hierarchical organization is thus closely tied to emergence. Each level of a hierarchy typically is governed by its own set of laws. (Holland, 2014)
Hierarchical structures
	•	Hierarchical structures are effective at managing large-scale operations, but much less efficient in managing conditions of high complexity. (Coker, 2009)
Hierarchical system
	•	In hierarchical systemsthere are people who are excluded from the estab- lished institutions of representation. Very often, these are people who have the fewest or the least socially valued skills in a wider social arena. They tend to be the most vulnerable in any social system. (Rayner and Cantor, 1987)
	•	Members of bureaucratic or hierarchical organizations will favor redistributive taxation as a means of apportioning costs. (Rayner and Cantor, 1987)
	•	According to cultural theory, adherents of hierarchy perceive acts of social deviance to be dangerous because such behavior may disrupt their preferred (superior/subordinate) form of social relations. (Wildavsky and Dake, 1990)
Hierarchical culture
	•	[…] hierarchical culture needs an economic base (Douglas, 2005:32)
High reliability theory
	•	“high reliability theory,” whose proponents argue that extremely safe operations are possible, even with extremely hazardous technologies; if appropriate organizational design and management techniques are followed. (Sagan, 1995)
	•	[…] high reliability theory and normal accident theory lead to very different predictions about the causes and the likelihood of serious nuclear weapons and command and control accidents. (Sagan, 1995)
	•	High reliability theorist believe that hazardous technologies can be safely controlled by complex organizations if wise design and management techniques are followed. This optimistic conclusion is based on the argument that effective organizations can meet the following four specific conditions which are necessary to create and maintain adequate safety: (1) political elites and organization leaders place a high priority on safety and reliability; (2) significant levels of redundancy exist, permitting backup or overlapping units to compensate for failures; (3) error rates are reduced through decentralization of authority, strong organization culture, and continuous operations and training; and (4) organization l learning takes place through a trial-and-error process, supplemented by anticipation and simulation . (Sagan, 1995)
	•	The high reliability theorists view successful hazardous organizations as reasonably rational actors: they have consistent and clear goals and can therefore learn how to maximize those objectives over time. (Sagan, 1995)
	•	The high reliability theorist identified four factors that should produce extremely safe operations, even in organizations operating hazardous technologies. (Sagan, 1995)
	•	High reliability theorist argue that a solution to this dilemma is a strong organizational culture, which creates a common set of decision-making premises and assumptions so that lower-level personnel, responding to surprises according to their own best judgement, nevertheless react in a uniform and appropriate manner. (Sagan, 1995)HRO researchers (labeled HRO in the rest of this paper) are limited in their applicability and usefulness for complex, high-risk systems. (Marais et al., 2004)
	•	HRO oversimplifies the problems faced by engineers and organizations building safety-critical systems and following some of the recommendations could lead to accidents. (Marais et al., 2004)
	•	Normal Accidents and HROs, both limit the progress that can be made toward achieving highly safe systems by too narrowly defining the problem and the potential solutions. (Marais et al., 2004)
	•	The authors examined a number of organizations, such as nuclear power plants and aircraft carriers, which face challenges in addressing uncertainty akin to those faced by intelligence organizations. Those organizations on a daily basis confront continually shifting conditions that can give rise to unexpected outcomes, with the potential for catastrophic consequences.8 Nonetheless, carriers experience exceptionally low rates of error and accident in comparison to other fields that also continually confront uncertainty, such as medicine. The same can be said of nuclear power plants where, according to another writer, “there is no ‘regular’ functioning of the plant— the status of the plant is continually changing and therefore...anomalies are very difficult to track.” (Fishbein and Treverton, 2004)
	•	In studying these types of “high reliability organizations” (HROs), Weick and Sutcliffe have identified lessons that can be applied generally to addressing uncertainty. The unifying trait of HROs is that they exhibit the quality of “mindfulness,” defined as: “...the combination of ongoing scrutiny of existing expectations, continuous refinement and differentiation of expectations based on new experiences, willingness and capability to invent new expectations that make sense of unprecedented ... intuition- based intelligence sense-making offers a way to comprehend those complex transnational threats whose speed, uncertainty, and interactivity defy traditional analytic approaches. events, ...and identification of new dimensions of context that improve foresight and current functioning.” (Fishbein and Treverton, 2004)
	•	High reliability organizations “tend to view any failure, no matter how small, as a window on the system as a whole.” (Fishbein and Treverton, 2004)
	•	HRO’s tend to be “skeptical, wary, suspicious of quiet periods,” because they know that “not all failure modes have...been experienced or exhaustively deduced.” Underpinning these attitudes is a “learning culture” in which it is safe and even valued for members of the organization to admit error and raise doubts. (Fishbein and Treverton, 2004)
	•	The refusal of HROs to simplify involves a refusal to take things for granted or to rely on standard interpretations. Personnel in HROs are relentless in their efforts to try to understand the complexities of the situations they face. (Fishbein and Treverton, 2004)

Hipster
	•	Even the hipster or the rebel is playing a role, with prescribed poses and tattoos. (Greene, 2018)
History
	•	[…] history takes the form of stories, memos, official histories, and institutionalized patterns of behavior. (Clarke, 1999)
	•	History is the evolution towards complex structures, created and manned by information flows which today are managed electronically. (Coker, 2009)
	•	History, of course, is full of fits and starts (‘punctuated equilibriums’ in the language of evolutionary biology), but the direction is clear enough to most historians. It is a direction away from simple sameness to diversity, towards complex sameness which we call, today, globalization (McNeill and McNeill 2003:320). (Coker, 2009)
	•	If history, however, is a story of rapid, accumulating change it is misleading to call this Progress. (Coker, 2009)
	•	It is only in historical perspective, after memoirs are written and government documents released, that the full story becomes available. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	History has always existed, but not always in a historical form. The temporalization of man as effected through the mediation of a society is equivalent to a humanization of time. The unconscious movement of time manifests itself and becomes true within historical consciousness. (Debord, 2012)
	•	Reasoning about history is inseparably reasoning about power. (Debord, 2012)
	•	History generally, and the history of revolutions in particular, is always richer in content, more varied, more manysided, more lively and 'subtle' than even" the best historian and the best methodologist can imagine. (Feyerabend, 1993)
	•	Accidents and conjunctures, and curious juxtapositions of events are the very substance of history, and the "complexity of human change and the unpredictable character of the ultimate consequences of any given act or decision of men" 3 its most conspicuous feature. (Feyerabend, 1993)
	•	l'histoire ne peut guère éterniser que des mythes. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Si l'on ne considérait que ces faits isolés l'histoire semblerait régie par d'invraisemblables hasards. (Lebon, 1895) 
	•	L'histoire, l'histoire littéraire et artistique surtout, n'étant que la répétition des mêmes jugements que personne n'essaie de contrôler, chacun finit par répéter ce qu'il a appris à l'école, et il y a des noms et des choses auxquels nul n'oserait toucher. (Lebon, 1895)
Historical momemtum
	•	Accidents and conjunctures, and curious juxtapositions of events are the very substance of history, and the "complexity of human change and the unpredictable character of the ultimate consequences of any given act or decision of men" its most conspicuous feature. (Feyerabend, 1993)
Historian
	•	The procedures and criteria most historians use to attribute causality are less well defined than the scientist’s.”The historian’s aim [is] to make a coherent whole out of the events he studies. His way of doing that, I suggest, is to look for certain dominant concepts or leading ideas by which to il-uminate his facts, to trace the connections between those ideas themselves, and then to show how the detailed facts became intelligible in the light of them by constructing a “significant” narrative of the events of the period in question.” (Heuer, 1999)
	•	The key ideas here are coherence and narrative. These are the principles that guide the organization of observations into meaningful structures and patterns. 
	•	The historian commonly observes only a single case, not a pattern of covariation (when two things are related so that change in one is associated with change in the other) in many comparable cases. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	the historian observes simultaneous changes in so many vari- ables that the principle of covariation generally is not helpful in sorting out the complex relationships among them. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	The narrative story, on the other hand, offers a means of organizing the rich complexity of the historian’s observations. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	The historian uses imagination to construct a coherent story out of fragments of data. (Heuer, 1999)
Hobbesian model of the state
	•	Hobbesian model of the state was based upon a social contract between all individuals who surrender part of their liberties, personal assets, and rights to the ‘sovereign’, who in turn guarantees their personal safety. (Zedner, 2009)
	•	[…] Hobbesian view of the trade-off between freedom and security […].(Zedner, 2009)
Homeostatic control systems 
	•	homeostatic control systems separate the process of policy-setting, monitoring and active intervention to correct deviation (Hood and Jones, 1996)
Homogamy
	•	Homogamy, the tendency of like to marry like, is very strong even in societies where marriages are not combined and, theoretically, everybody could match with everybody else. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
	•	Homogamy is a specific instance of homophily: this consists of a general trend of like to link to like, and is a powerful force in shaping social networks, according to much sociological evidence. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
Homogenizing process
	•	homogenizing process results in the production of key words which cover agreed concepts (Douglas, 2005)
Homogenizing educational process 
	•	homogenizing educational process that Gellner describes as the infrastructure of nationalism is also the necessary infrastructure of cultural bias, but the effective locus of transformation is the law court, not the schoolroom (Douglas, 2005:33)
Homonymies
	•	Homonymies occur when the same word is used with different meanings. (Sottilotta, 2016)
Honesty
	•	Projecting sincerity and honesty always plays well. A few public confessions of your weaknesses and vulnerabilities will do the trick. For some reason people see signs of humility as authentic, even though people might very well be simulating them. Learn how to occasionally lower your head and appear humble. If dirty work must be done, get others to do it. Your hands are clean. Never overtly play the Machiavellian leader—that only works well on television. Use the appropriate dominance cues to make people think you are powerful, even before you reach the heights. You want to seem like you were destined for success, a mystical effect that always works. (Greene, 2018)
Honnour
	•	Laissons donc la raison aux philosophes, mais ne lui demandons pas trop d'intervenir dans le gouvernement des hommes. Ce n'est pas avec la raison et c'est le plus souvent malgré elle, que se sont créés des sentiments tels que l'honneur, l'abnégation, la foi religieuse, l'amour de la gloire et de la patrie, qui ont été jusqu'ici les grands ressorts de toutes les civilisations. (Lebon, 1895)
Hopital
	•	L’édit royal du 27 avril 1656 qui porte création de l’Hôpital général reçoit la mission essentielle d’empêcher « la mendicité et l’oisiveté comme les sources de tous les désordres ». (Mannoni, 1985)
Hormesis
	•	Hormesis has been defined as a dose-response relationship in which there is a stimulatory response at low-doses, but an inhibitory response at high doses. resulting in a U- or inverted U-shaped dose response (Calabrese. 2001). (Williams and Paustenbach, 2002)
Hostility
	•	"hostile" is anattribute not of the vehicle but of the socially constituted relationship.  (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	Enough signs of discomfort indicated secret hostility. (Greene, 2018)
	•	The value in detecting possible hostility or negative feelings early on is that it increases your strategic options and room to maneuver. You can lay a trap for people, intentionally stirring their hostility and goading them into some aggressive action that will embarrass them in the long run. Or you can work doubly hard to neutralize their dislike of you and even win them over through a charm offensive. Or you can simply create distance—not hiring them, firing them, refusing to interact with them. In the end, you will make your path much smoother by avoiding surprise battles and acts of sabotage. (Greene, 2018)
Hub
	•	The presence of these hubs is not specific to the stockbroker’s social network, or to the airport network. Many other systems, when represented as graphs, show similar highly connected vertices, or superconnectors. In many networks, one can see a ‘winner takes all’ tendency: a few nodes attract the majority of connections, and the large remainder of nodes have to share the remaining links. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
	•	Hubs are also present in the networks inside the cell. In the genetic regulatory network, a single gene can control the expression of a large portion of the rest of the genome: in one bacterium (the Caulobacter crescentus), one single regulatory factor (the CtrA) controls 26 per cent of the cell cycle-regulated genes. The p53 molecule is a superconnector of the protein interaction network: the gene associated to this protein is a powerful tumor suppressor, and it is mutated in a large range of tumors. A clear hub of the metabolic network is the Atp molecule (adenosine triphosphate): this plays the role of energy carrier for a large number of biochemical reactions. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
	•	Looking at the degree distribution is the best way to check if a network is heterogeneous or not: if the distribution is fat tailed, then the network will have hubs and heterogeneity. A mathematically perfect power law is never found, because this would imply the existence of hubs with an infinite number of connections. However, no real network is infinitely big: this is why the fat tail of the degree distribution always has a cut-off at a maximum value for the degree. Indeed, the size of hubs can be limited by various costs of accumulating connections: for example, neurons cannot accumulate an arbitrary amount of connections, because of their physical and now represents a wide variety of topics in history, philosophy, religion, science, and the humanities. The VSI ve of the structure. In professional collaboration networks, time plays a role: connections cannot be accumulated indefinitely, because at a certain moment the career (or life) of an individual comes to an end. All these and other factors are reflected in the shape of the degree distribution. Nonetheless, a strongly skewed, fat-tailed distribution is a clear signal of heterogeneity, even if it is never a perfect power law. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
Human
	•	We humans are consummate actors. We learn at an early age how to get what we want from our parents by putting on certain looks that will elicit sympathy or affection. We learn how to conceal from our parents or siblings exactly what we’re thinking or feeling, to protect ourselves in vulnerable moments. We become good at flattering those whom it is important to win over—popular peers or teachers. We learn how to fit into the group by wearing the same clothes and speaking the same language. As we get older and strive to carve out a career, we learn how to create the proper front in order to be hired and to fit into a group culture. If we become an executive or a professor or a bartender, we must act the part. (Greene, 2018)
Human action
	•	Much research into how people assess the causes of behavior employs a basic dichotomy between internal determinants and external determinants of human actions. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	The research examines the circumstances under which people attribute behavior either to stable dispositions of the actor or to characteristics of the situation to which the actor responds. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Differences in judgments about what causes another person’s or government’s behavior affect how people respond to that behavior. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	How people respond to friendly or unfriendly actions by others may be quite different if they attribute the behavior to the nature of the person or government than if they see the behavior as resulting from situational constraints over which the person or government has little control. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	A fundamental error made in judging the causes of behavior is to overestimate the role of internal factors and underestimate the role of external factors. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	When observing another’s behavior, people are too inclined to infer that the behavior was caused by broad personal qualities or dispositions of the other person and to expect that these same inherent qualities will determine the actor’s behavior under other circumstances. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	People and governments seldom consider the possibility that their own actions have had unintended consequences. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	People and governments also tend to overestimate their own impor- tance as the target of others’ actions. They are sensitive to the impact that others’ actions have on them, and they generally assume that people and governments intend to do what they do and intend it to have the effect that it has. They are much less aware of, and consequently tend to downgrade the importance of, other causes or results of the action. (Heuer, 1999)
Internal causes of behavior
	•	Internal causes of behavior include a person’s attitudes, beliefs, and personality. (Heuer, 1999)
External causes of behavior
	•	External causes include incen- tives and constraints, role requirements, social pressures, or other forces over which the individual has little control. (Heuer, 1999)
Human animal
	•	Your task as a student of human nature, and someone aspiring to reach the greater potential of the human animal, is to widen your relationship to time as much as possible, and slow it down. This means you do not see the passage of time as an enemy but rather as a great ally. Each stage in life has its advantages—those of youth are most obvious, but with age comes greater perspective. (Greene, 2018)

Human culture
	•	In human culture, we can see a phenomenon—changes in fashions and styles—that at first glance might appear trivial, but that in fact is quite profound, revealing a deep and fascinating part of human nature. (Greene, 2018)
Human condition
Human social condition
	•	The human social condition is always a political one. (Gray, 2014)
Human energy
	•	We are born with a powerful energy that is distinctly human. We can call it willpower, assertiveness, or even aggression, but it is mixed with our intelligence and cleverness. It was revealed to us in its purest state in childhood. This energy made us bold and adventurous, not only physically but mentally, wanting to explore ideas and soak up knowledge. It made us actively search for friends with whom we could explore together. It also made us rather relentless when it came to solving problems or getting what we wanted. (Children can often be bold in what they ask for.) It made us open to the world and to new experiences. And if we felt frustrated and helpless for long enough periods of time, this same energy could make us unusually combative. (Greene, 2018)
	•	What you must understand is the following: almost nothing in the world can resist persistent human energy. Things will yield if we strike enough blows with enough force. Look at how many great people in history have succeeded in this way. (Greene, 2018)

Human error
	•	Human error in the design of the plant is one of the things that the systematic approach described above is intended to reduce; with its emphasis on tracing out possible fault trees and their analysis by PSA. (Great Britain and Health and Safety Executive, 1992)
	•	Human error in construction of and modification to plant can likewise be, and is, minimised by the application of modern quality assurance and reliability systems. Moreover, some errors of this type are already taken into account in the risk figures used by PSA, since as explained these are derived from the failure rates of other operating systems constructed and modified in similar ways. (Great Britain and Health and Safety Executive, 1992)
	•	Human errors in operation or maintenance of a plant, though also taken into account in the risk figures, require a different method of control. Some human intervention is required even in a highly automatic system, because although people maymakemistakes,theyalsohaveacapacity unparalleled by machines, to operate skilfully and make correct judgements in unprecedented situations. This unique human capacity has to be preserved, while deliberately making harmful intervention as difficult as possible. (Great Britain and Health and Safety Executive, 1992)
	•	It is possible to apply Probabilistic Safety Analysis (PSA) to human errors in ways resembling its application to mechanical systems. The class of actions considered above can be represented in PSA currently in two ways. First, PSA studies need to allow for the dependencies between safety systems, that is to say situations where the overall reliability is significantly less than if systems were totally independent. Past experience of incidents is used to indicate factors that reduce or increase dependence. The overall reliability is then represented by a 'dependence' or 'common cause failure' model. (Great Britain and Health and Safety Executive, 1992)
	•	PSA seeks to address human error directly. For errors of skill, slips and lapses, there are well established models and data that can give reasonable numerical estimates of human error. For 'knowledge-based' actions, which include the errors of misunderstanding mentioned above, the situation is more difficult. Since such incidents are less common, our database of past experience is insufficient for a reliable estimate specific to a particular plant design. However, we do have a reasonable understanding of factors that help to avoid or mitigate these potentially serious errors. Such defences include diverse supervisory staff, computer-based diagnostic tools, well-designed symptom-based procedures and alarms, built-in time delays, good instructional systems, providing feedback on the effects of actions taken. They also provide against interference with any system while thought is given to the cause of any difficulty. (Great Britain and Health and Safety Executive, 1992)
	•	PSA can therefore evaluate qualitatively the strength of these defences, so as to say which of two situations is safer; even though we cannot predict quantitatively the exact frequency with which these knowledge-based errors may occur. We can also judge an upper bound on the contribution these errors make to the risk from the plant, because by definition errors for which there are few data are very infrequent events. In time, our ability to model this class of errors will improve both with increased data from past experience, and with more validation of the models that are currently being proposed.
	•	The total of these approaches to human error analysis should be able to demonstrate, and in some recent cases has demonstrated, that a well-designed plant can limit the effect of operational human errors to being of the same order as more conventional engineering failures. Since the main residual uncertainty involves procedural and knowledge-based error, the NII regards the scrutiny of operating procedures and contingency planning of all kinds as being as much a part of its business as attention to design, or to the actual operation's record and log. The need to specify procedures and follow them is a part of the licensing conditions of any station. The procedures and any incidents throwing light on them are regularly reviewed. (Great Britain and Health and Safety Executive, 1992)
Human existance
	•	The truth is that banality is part of human existence. (Greene, 2018)
Human factor
	•	In trying to estimate the total risk, the possibility of human error must also be taken into account. It may enter, not merely into the use of the plant once it exists, but also into the original decisions taken when that plant is planned and introduced. (Great Britain and Health and Safety Executive, 1992)
Human mind
	•	In his conception, the human mind has to worship something, has to have its attention directed to something it values above all else. For most people, it is their ego; for some it is their family, their clan, their god, or their nation. For Pericles it would be nous, the ancient Greek word for “mind” or “intelligence.” Nous is a force that permeates the universe, creating meaning and order. (Greene, 2018)
	•	The human mind is naturally attracted to this order; this is the source of our intelligence. (Greene, 2018) 
Human nature
	•	Let us call the collection of these forces that push and pull at us from deep within human nature. Human nature stems from the particular wiring of our brains, the configuration of our nervous system, and the way we humans process emotions, all of which developed and emerged over the course of the five million years or so of our evolution as a species. (Greene, 2018)
	•	We can ascribe many of the details of our nature to the distinct way we evolved as a social animal to ensure our survival—learning to cooperate with others, coordinating our actions with the group on a high level, creating novel forms of communication and ways of maintaining group discipline. This early development lives on within us and continues to determine our behavior, even in the modern, sophisticated world we live in. (Greene, 2018)
	•	The survival of our earliest ancestors depended on their ability to communicate with one another well before the invention of language. They evolved new and complex emotions—joy, shame, gratitude, jealousy, resentment, et cetera. The signs of these emotions could be read immediately on their faces, communicating their moods quickly and effectively. They became extremely permeable to the emotions of others as a way to bind the group more tightly together—to feel joy or grief as one—or to remain united in the face of danger. To this day, we humans remain highly susceptible to the moods and emotions of those around us, compelling all kinds of behavior on our part—unconsciously imitating others, wanting what they have, getting swept up in viral feelings of anger or outrage. We imagine we’re acting of our own free will, unaware of how deeply our susceptibility to the emotions of others in the group is affecting what we do and how we respond. (Greene, 2018)
	•	We can point to other such forces that emerged from this deep past and that similarly mold our everyday behavior—for instance, our need to continually rank ourselves and measure our Self-worth through our status is a trait that is noticeable among all hunter-gatherer cultures, and even among chimpanzees, as are our tribal instincts, which cause us to divide people into insiders or outsiders. We can add to these primitive qualities our need to wear masks to disguise any behavior that is frowned upon by the tribe, leading to the formation of a shadow personality from all the dark desires we have repressed. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Once this primal current or force within us reaches the level of consciousness, we have to react to it, and we do so depending on our individual spirit and circumstances, usually explaining it away superficially without really understanding it. Because of the precise way in which we evolved, there are a limited number of these forces of human nature, and they lead to the behavior mentioned above—envy, grandiosity, irrationality, shortsightedness, conformity, aggression, and passive aggression, to name a few. They also lead to empathy and other positive forms of human behavior. (Greene, 2018)
	•	We can call them laws in that under the influence of these elemental forces, we humans tend to react in relatively predictable ways. (Greene, 2018)
	•	no longer passive slaves to human nature but actively transforming it. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Human nature is stronger than any individual, than any institution or technological invention. It ends up shaping what we create to reflect itself and its primitive roots. It moves us around like pawns. 
	•	Refusing to come to terms with human nature simply means that you are dooming yourself to patterns. (Greene, 2018)
	•	The book will teach you to stop taking personally their insinuating comments, shows of coldness, or moments of irritation. The more you grasp this, the easier it will be to react not with your emotions but rather with the desire to understand where their behavior might come from. You will feel much calmer in the process. And as this takes root in you, you will be less prone to moralize and judge people; instead you will accept them and their flaws as part of human nature. (Greene, 2018)
	•	You will think in terms of opposites—when people overtly display some trait, such as confidence or hypermasculinity, they are most often concealing the contrary reality. You will realize that people are continually playing to the public, making a show of being progressive and saintly only to better disguise their shadow. You will see the signs of this shadow leaking out in everyday life. (Greene, 2018)
	•	If people take an action that seems out of character, you will take note: what often appears out of character is actually more of their true character. (Greene, 2018)
	•	we are poorly equipped to gauge the character of the people we deal with. Their public image, the reputation that precedes them, easily mesmerizes us. We are captivated by appearances. If they surround themselves with some alluring myth, as Hughes did, we want to believe in it. Instead of determining people’s character—their ability to work with others, to keep to their promises, to remain strong in adverse circumstances—we choose to work with or hire people based on their glittering résumé, their intelligence, and their charm. But even a positive trait such as intelligence is worthless if the person also happens to be of weak or dubious character. And so, because of our blind spot, we suffer under the irresolute leader, the micromanaging boss, the conniving partner. This is the source of endless tragedies in history, our pattern as a species. (Greene, 2018)
	•	By nature, we humans are not easily contented with our circumstances. By some perverse force within us, the moment we possess something or get what we want, our minds begin to drift toward something new and different, to imagine we can have better. The more distant and unattainable this new object, the greater is our desire to have it. We can call this the grass-is-always-greener syndrome, the psychological equivalent of an optical illusion—if we get too close to the grass, to that new object, we see that is not really so green after all. (Greene, 2018)
	•	All of this makes the grass-is-always-greener syndrome inevitable in our psychological makeup. We should not moralize or complain about this possible flaw in human nature. It is a part of the mental life of each one of us, and it has many benefits. It is the source of our ability to think of new possibilities and innovate. It is what has made our imagination such a powerful instrument. And on the flip side it is the material out of which we can move, excite, and seduce people. (Greene, 2018)
	•	ou are embedded in an environment that consists of the people you know and the places you frequent. This is your reality. Your mind is being continually drawn far away from this reality, because of human nature. (Greene, 2018)
	•	In the end you cannot escape from yourself. (Greene, 2018)
	•	We humans tend to live in the moment. It is the animal part of our nature. We respond first and foremost to what we see and hear, to what is most dramatic in an event. (Greene, 2018)
	•	When we limit our thinking to what our senses provide, to what is immediate, we descend to the pure animal level in which our reasoning powers are neutralized. We are no longer aware of why or how things come about. We imagine that some successful scheme that has lasted a few months can only get better. We no longer give thought to the possible consequences of anything we set in motion. We react to what is given in the moment, based on only a small piece of the puzzle. Naturally our actions then lead to unintended consequences, or even to disasters like the South Sea crash or the more recent crash of 2008. (Greene, 2018)
	•	To complicate matters, we are surrounded by others who are continually reacting, drawing us deeper into the present. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Our only antidote is to train ourselves to continually detach from the immediate rush of events and elevate our perspective. Instead of merely reacting, we step back and look at the wider context. We consider the various possible ramifications of any action we take. We keep in mind our long-term goals. Often, in raising our perspective, we will decide that it is better to do nothing, to not react, and to let time go by and see what it reveals. (If Blunt had only waited a few months, he would have seen Law’s scheme falling apart, and England would have been spared the ruin that came.) Such sanity and balance do not come naturally. They are powers we acquire through great effort, and they represent the height of human wisdom. (Greene, 2018)
	•	In a world that is complex, with myriad dangers that loom in the future, our short-term tendencies pose a continual threat to our well- being. And as our attention spans decrease because of technology, the threat is even greater. In many ways we are defined by our relationship to time. When we simply react to what we see and hear, when we swing from excitement and exuberance to fear and panic at each new piece of dramatic news, when we gear our actions toward gaining as much pleasure as possible in the moment without a thought for future consequences, we can say that we are giving in to our animal nature, to what is most primitive and potentially destructive in our neurological makeup. (Greene, 2018)
	•	When we strive to go against this grain, to consider more deeply the consequences of what we do and the nature of our long-term priorities, we are straining to realize our true human potential as the thinking animal. And just as short-term thinking can be contagious, one individual who embodies the wisdom of the farsighted perspective can have an immensely positive effect on the people around him or her. Such individuals make us aware of the larger picture and reveal a mind-set that we recognize as superior. We want to imitate them. (Greene, 2018)
	•	The best way to overcome this is to recognize the clear signs of shortsighted thinking in our own lives. As with most elements of human nature, awareness is the key. Only by seeing these signs can we combat them. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Your task as a student of human nature, and someone aspiring to reach the greater potential of the human animal, is to widen your relationship to time as much as possible, and slow it down. This means you do not see the passage of time as an enemy but rather as a great ally. Each stage in life has its advantages—those of youth are most obvious, but with age comes greater perspective. (Greene, 2018)
	•	we cannot reengineer human nature, and even if we somehow succeeded, the result could be a lot worse than what we have. (Greene, 2018)
	•	From this more neutral stance, you can then try to understand the people you deal with on a deeper level, as Chekhov did with his father. The more you do this, the more tolerant you will tend to become toward people and toward human nature in general. Your open, generous spirit will make your social interactions much smoother, and people will be drawn to you. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Human nature is too unpredictable. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Many psychologists have attempted to define the component parts of human nature, and while their terminology is not the same, they do follow more or less the same general outlines. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
Laws of human nature
	•	THE LAWS OF HUMAN NATURE is designed to immerse you in all aspects of human behavior and illuminate its root causes. If you let it guide you, it will radically alter how you perceive people and your entire approach to dealing with them.. (Greene, 2018)
	•	the Laws will work to transform you into a calmer and more strategic observer of people, helping to free you from all the emotional drama that needlessly drains you. (Greene, 2018)
	•	The Laws will help you avoid falling into this trap by revealing that people are generally dealing with emotions and issues that have deep roots. They’re experiencing some desires and disappointments that predate you by years and decades. You cross their path at a particular moment and become the convenient target of their anger or frustration. They’re projecting onto you certain qualities they want to see. In most cases, they’re not relating to you as an individual. (Greene, 2018)
	•	the Laws will make you a master interpreter of the cues that people continually emit, giving you a much greater ability to judge their character. (Greene, 2018)
	•	The Laws will rid you of this habit by making it clear how easy it is to misread people and how deceptive first impressions can be. (Greene, 2018)
	•	the Laws will empower you to take on and outthink the toxic types who inevitably cross your path and who tend to cause long-term emotional damage. (Greene, 2018)
	•	the Laws will teach you the true levers for motivating and influencing people, making your path in life that much easier. (Greene, 2018)
	•	The Laws will teach you that people are naturally stubborn and resistant to influence. You must begin any attempt by lowering their resistance and never inadvertently feeding their defensive tendencies. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Understanding the permeability of emotions, you will learn that the most effective means of influence is to alter your moods and attitude. People are responding to your energy and demeanor even more than to your words. You will get rid of any defensiveness on your part. Instead, feeling relaxed and genuinely interested in the other person will have a positive and hypnotic effect. You will learn that as a leader your best means of moving people in your direction lies in setting the right tone through your attitude, empathy, and work ethic. (Greene, 2018)
	•	the Laws will make you realize how deeply the forces of human nature operate within you, giving you the power to alter your own negative patterns. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Our natural response to reading or hearing about the darker qualities in human nature is to exclude ourselves. It is always the other person who is narcissistic, irrational, envious, grandiose, aggressive, or passive-aggressive. We almost always see ourselves as having the best intentions. If we go astray, it is the fault of circumstances or people forcing us to react negatively. The Laws will make you stop once and for all this Self-deluding process. We are all cut from the same cloth, and we all share the same tendencies. The sooner you realize this, the greater your power will be in overcoming these potential negative traits within you. You will examine your own motives, look at your own shadow, and become aware of your own passive-aggressive tendencies. This will make it that much easier to spot such traits in others. (Greene, 2018)
	•	the Laws will transform you into a more empathetic individual, creating deeper and more satisfying bonds with the people around you. (Greene, 2018) 
	•	the Laws will alter how you see your own potential, making you aware of a higher, ideal self within you that you will want to bring out. (Greene, 2018)
Human resource management
	•	Schuler and Jackson (1987a) organized HRM practices into five basic areas: (1)  planning, (2) staffing, (3) appraising, (4) compensating, and (5) training and  development.  (Terpstra and Rozell, 2006)
	•	the use and effectiveness of some HRM practices is presumed to vary across  organizations  dueto  different  strategies,  organizational characteristics,  and  external  fac-tors (Cleveland, Murphy, & Williams, 1989; Jackson, Schuler, & Rivero,1989; Saari, Johnson,  McLaughlin,  & Zimmerle,  1988).  (Terpstra and Rozell, 2006)
Hume’s problem
	•	Mathematicians had found a formal solution to Hume’s problem of induction: they decided that the probability for an event 1⁄4 the relative frequency of similar events in the past where the number of experiments (events in the database) is infinite. In mathematical vocabulary the probability equals the limit of the relative frequency when the number of experiments is infinite. But this definition also renders this interpretation unpractical – we never actually have infinite data in real life. We need to take decisions (personal, political, ethical) on a finite database. Unlike what some people tend to think, having simply a vast number of events (yet a finite one) in the database is not enough to conclude that the computed probability is necessarily true. (Rosenberg, 2008)
Humility
	•	As we get older, we tend to place limits on how far we can go in life. Over the years we internalize the criticisms and doubts of others. By accepting what we think to be the limits of our intelligence and creative powers, we create a self-fulfilling dynamic. They become our limits. You do not need to be so humble and self-effacing in this world. Such humility is not a virtue but is rather a value that people promote to help keep you down. Whatever you are doing now, you are in fact capable of much more, and by thinking that, you will create a very different dynamic. (Greene, 2018)
Grandiose humility
	•	In the world today, you will also notice the prevalence of negative forms of grandiosity. Many people feel the need to disguise their grandiose urges not only from others but also from themselves. They will frequently make a show of their humility—they are not interested in power or feeling important, or so they say. They are happy with their small lot in life. They do not want a lot of possessions, do not own a car, and disdain status. But you will notice they have a need to display this humility in a public manner. It is grandiose humility—their way to get attention and to feel morally superior. (Greene, 2018)
Husband
	•	les maris sont les mêmes partout ; du moment où vous avez étudié l'individu dans un pays quelconque, vous connaissez la race. (Dumas, 1998)
Hyperintention
	•	We all know the effects of “hyperintention”: If we want and need desperately to sleep, we are less likely to fall asleep. If we absolutely must give the best talk possible at some conference, we become hyperanxious about the result, and the performance suffers. If we desperately need to find an intimate partner or make friends, we are more likely to push them away. If instead we relax and focus on other things, we are more likely to fall asleep or give a great talk or charm people. The most pleasurable things in life occur as a result of something not directly intended and expected. When we try to manufacture happy moments, they tend to disappoint us. (Greene, 2018)
Hypothesis
	•	The scientist seeks to disprove a hypothesis, not to confirm it. A hypothesis is accepted only when it cannot be rejected. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	A hypothesis is a potential explanation or conclusion that is to be tested by collecting and presenting evidence. (Pherson, 2009)
	•	It is a declarative statement that has not been established as true─an “educated guess” based on observation to be supported or refuted by more observation or through experimentation. (Pherson, 2009)
	•	Gaining confidence in a hypothesis is not a function solely of accumulating evidence in its favor, but also in showing that situations that could establish its falsity do not, in fact, happen. (Pherson, 2009)
	•	This book uses the term hypothesis in its broadest sense as a potential explanation or conclusion that is to be tested by collecting and presenting evidence. (Heuer, 1999)
Ad Hoc hypothesis
	•	It is customary to assume that good scientists refuse to employ ad hochypotheses, and to assert that they are right in their refusal. New ideas, so it is thought, go far beyond the available evidence, and they must go beyond it in order to be of value. Ad hoc hypotheses are bound to creep in eventually, but they should be resisted and kept at bay. This is the customary attitude as it is expressed, for example, in the writings of K. R. Popper. (Feyerabend, 1993)
	•	As opposed to this, Lakatos, in lectures, and now also in publications, has pointed out that "adhocness" is neither despicable nor absent from the body of science. New ideas, he emphasizes, are usually almost entirely ad hoc, they cannot be otherwise. And they are reformed only in a piece-meal fashion, by gradually stretching them, so that they apply to situa- tions lying beyond their starting point. Schematically: Popper: new theories have, and must have, excess content which is, butshould not be, gradually infected by ad hoc adaptations.Lakatos: new theories are, and cannot be anything but, ad hoc. Excess con- tent is, and should be, created in a piecemeal fashion, by gradually ex-tending them to new facts and domains. (Feyerabend, 1993)
Hyphotesis assessment
	•	Once the need to present alternative hypotheses is accepted, the next step is to estimate the relative probability of each—or if the alternative hypothesis is not well defined, one’s degree of confidence that one’s preferred interpretation is correct. (Weiss, 2008)
Situational Logic
	•	This is the most common operating mode for intelligence analysts. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Generation and analysis of hypotheses start with consideration of concrete elements of the current situation, rather than with broad generalizations that encompass many similar cases. The situation is regarded as one-of-a-kind, so that it must be understood in terms of its own unique logic, rather than as one example of a broad class of comparable events. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Starting with the known facts of the current situation and an under- standing of the unique forces at work at that particular time and place, the analyst seeks to identify the logical antecedents or consequences of this situation. A scenario is developed that hangs together as a plausible narrative. The analyst may work backwards to explain the origins or causes of the current situation or forward to estimate the future outcome. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Situational logic commonly focuses on tracing cause-effect relation- ships or, when dealing with purposive behavior, means-ends relationships. The analyst identifies the goals being pursued and explains why the foreign actor(s) believe certain means will achieve those goals. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Particular strengths of situational logic are its wide applicability and ability to integrate a large volume of relevant detail. Any situation, how- ever unique, may be analyzed in this manner. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Situational logic as an analytical strategy also has two principal weaknesses. One is that it is so difficult to understand the mental and bureaucratic processes of foreign leaders and governments. To see the options faced by foreign leaders as these leaders see them, one must understand their values and assumptions and even their misperceptions and misunderstandings. Without such insight, interpreting foreign leaders’ decisions or forecasting future decisions is often little more than partially informed speculation. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	The second weakness is that situational logic fails to exploit the theoretical knowledge derived from study of similar phenomena in other countries and other time periods. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Situational logic looks at the evidence within a single country on multiple interrelated issues. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Logic-of-the-situation analysis also draws heavily on theoretical assumptions. (Heuer, 1999)
Theoretical analysis
	•	What academics refer to as theory is really only a more explicit version of what intelligence analysts think of as their basic understanding of how individuals, institutions, and political systems normally behave. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	There are both advantages and drawbacks to applying theory in in- telligence analysis. One advantage is that “theory economizes thought.” By identifying the key elements of a problem, theory enables an analyst to sort through a mass of less significant detail. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Theory enables the analyst to see beyond today’s transient developments, to recognize which trends are superficial and which are significant, and to foresee future develop- ments for which there is today little concrete evidence. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	the application of a generally accepted theoretical proposition enables the analyst to forecast an outcome for which the “hard evidence” has not yet begun to develop. This is an important strength of theoretical analysis when applied to realworld problems. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Theoretical analysis looks at the evidence related to a single issue in multiple countries, as shown by the row highlighted in gray. This is a typical social science approach. (Heuer, 1999)
Comparison
	•	An analyst seeks understanding of current events by comparing them with historical precedents in the same country, or with similar events in other countries. (Heuer, 1999) 
	•	Comparison differs from situational logic in that the present situation is interpreted in the light of a more or less explicit conceptual model that is created by looking at similar situations in other times or places. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	It differs from theoretical analysis in that this conceptual model is based on a single case or only a few cases, rather than on many similar cases. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Comparison may also be used to generate theory, but this is a more nar- row kind of theorizing that cannot be validated nearly as well as generalizations inferred from many comparable cases. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Reasoning by comparison is a convenient shortcut, one chosen when neither data nor theory are available for the other analytical strategies, or simply because it is easier and less time-consuming than a more detailed analysis. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	A careful comparative analysis starts by specifying key elements of the present situation. The analyst then seeks out one or more historical precedents that may shed light on the present. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	The tendency to relate contemporary events to earlier events as a guide to understanding is a powerful one. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Comparison helps achieve understanding by reducing the unfamiliar to the familiar. 
	•	In the absence of data required for a full understanding of the current situation, reasoning by comparison may be the only alternative. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Anyone taking this approach, however, should be aware of the significant potential for error. This course is an implicit admission of the lack of sufficient information to under- stand the present situation in its own right, and lack of relevant theory to relate the present situation to many other comparable situations. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	The difficulty, of course, is in being certain that two situations are truly comparable. Because they are equivalent in some respects, there is a tendency to reason as though they were equivalent in all respects, and to assume that the current situation will have the same or similar outcome as the historical situation. This is a valid assumption only when based on in-depth analysis of both the current situation and the historical precedent to ensure that they are actually comparable in all relevant respects. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	The most productive uses of comparative analysis are to sug- gest hypotheses and to highlight differences, not to draw conclusions. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Comparison can suggest the presence or the influence of variables that are not readily apparent in the current situation, or stimulate the imagination to conceive explanations or possible outcomes that might not otherwise occur to the analyst. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	comparison can generate hypotheses that then guide the search for additional information to confirm or refute these hypotheses. It should not, however, form the basis for conclusions unless thorough analysis of both situations has confirmed they are indeed comparable. (Heuer, 1999)
Analogy
	•	Analogy is one form of comparison. When an historical situation is deemed comparable to current circumstances, analysts use their understanding of the historical precedent to fill gaps in their understanding of the current situation. Unknown elements of the present are assumed to be the same as known elements of the historical precedent. Thus, analysts reason that the same forces are at work, that the outcome of the present situation is likely to be similar to the outcome of the historical situation, or that a certain policy is required in order to avoid the same outcome as in the past. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	a historical precedent may be so vivid and powerful that it imposes itself upon a person’s thinking from the outset, conditioning them to perceive the present primarily in terms of its similarity to the past. This is reasoning by analogy. As Robert Jervis noted, “historical analogies often precede, rather than follow, a careful analysis of a situation.” (Heuer, 1999)
Hypothesis generation
	•	Research on hypothesis generation suggests that performance on this task is woefully inadequate. When faced with an analytical problem, people are either unable or simply do not take the time to identify the full range of potential answers. Analytical performance might be significantly enhanced by more deliberate attention to this stage of the analytical process. Analysts need to take more time to develop a full set of competing hypotheses, using all three of the previously discussed strategies—theory, situational logic, and comparison. (Heuer, 1999)
Alternative hypothesis
	•	Recent events have focused new attention on the need for intelligence professionals to present alternative hypotheses to policymakers in a way that makes clear the uncertainties in the evaluation and interpretation of the evidence on which they are based, and the fact that it is rarely possible to exclude alternative explanations.2 This information improves the ability of decisionmakers, if they so wish, to take into account the risk that intelligence estimates may not be correct. (Weiss, 2008)
I
Idea
	•	An idea is also usually right if it is profitable to believe in it. (Coker, 2009)
	•	Ideas are things to play with. If you hold on to them for too long, they become something dead. (Greene, 2018)
	•	All that remains is that some of our ideas are accompanied by strong and vivid psychological processes, "sensations," while others are not. (Feyerabend, 1993)
Free association of ideas
	•	As children, our minds were much more fluid and open. We would make the most surprising and creative associations between ideas. But as we get older, we tend to tighten this down. We live in a sophisticated, high-tech world dominated by statistics and ideas gleaned from big data. Free associations between ideas, images from dreams, hunches, and intuitions seem irrational and subjective. But this leads to the most sterile forms of thinking. The unconscious, the Shadow side of the mind, has powers we must learn to tap into. And in fact some of the most creative people in our midst actively engage this side of thinking. (Greene, 2018)
Ideal type
	•	‘ideal type’ – an abstraction allowing comparisons of social phenomena across different contexts (Stilgoe et al., 2006)
Idealization
Overidealization
	•	This can serve as one of the most potent covers for the Shadow. Let us say we believe in some cause, such as the importance of transparency in our actions, particularly in politics. Or we admire and follow the leader of just such a cause. Or we decide that some new type of financial investment—mortgage-backed securities, for instance—represents the latest and most sophisticated path to wealth. In these situations we go much further than simple enthusiasm. We are charged with powerful conviction. We gloss over any faults, inconsistencies, or possible downsides. We see everything in black-and-white terms—our cause is moral, modern, and progressive; the other side, including doubters, is evil and reactionary.We now feel sanctioned to do everything for the cause—lie, cheat, manipulate, spy, falsify scientific data, get revenge. Anything the leader does is justified. In the case of the investment, we feel justified in taking what normally would be seen as great risks, because this time the financial tool is different and new, not subject to the usual rules. We can be as greedy as we like without worrying about the consequences.We tend to be dazzled by the strength of people’s convictions and interpret excessive behavior as simply overzealousness. But we should look at it in another light. By overidealizing a cause, person, or object, people can give free rein to the Shadow. That is their unconscious motivation. The bullying, the manipulations, the greed that comes out for the sake of the cause or product should be taken at face value, the overly strong conviction providing simple cover for repressed emotions to play themselves out.Related to this, in arguments people will use their powerful convictions as a perfect way to disguise their desires to bully and intimidate. They trot out statistics and anecdotes (which can always be found) to buttress their case, then proceed to insult or impugn our integrity. It’s just an exchange of ideas, they say. Pay attention to the bullying tone, and do not be fooled. Intellectuals might be subtler. They will lord it over us with obscure language and ideas we cannot decode, and we are made to feel inferior for our ignorance. In all cases, see this as repressed aggression finding a way to leak out. (Greene, 2018)
Identity
	•	identity is intrinsically oriented with the purpose of reproducing difference between the self and its other (Shih, 2012)
	•	Identity is a multi-faceted, complex phenomenon. It is both a dynamic process and a dynamic state of being. (Breakwell, 2014)
	•	Identity can be described in terms of both its structure and in terms of its processes. (Breakwell, 2014)
	•	Soon, however, comes a critical period in our early lives in which we must separate from our parents and forge our identity. And the simplest and most powerful way to create this identity is around gender roles, the masculine and the feminine. (Greene, 2018)
Masculine identity
	•	The boy will tend to have an ambivalent relationship to his mother that will mark him for life. On the one hand he craves the security and adoring attention she gives him; on the other hand he feels threatened by her, as if she might suffocate him in her femininity and he would lose himself. He fears her authority and her power over his life. From a certain age forward, he feels the need to differentiate himself. He needs to establish his own sense of masculine identity. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Certainly the physical changes that occur as he gets older will fuel this identity with the masculine, but in the process he will tend to overidentify with the role (unless he identifies with the feminine role instead), playing up his toughness and independence to emphasize his separation from the mother. The other sides to his character—the empathy, the gentleness, the need for connection, which he absorbed from the mother or were naturally a part of him—will tend to become repressed and sink into the unconscious. (Greene, 2018)
Feminine identity
	•	The girl may have an adventurous spirit and may incorporate the willpower and determination of her father into her own personality. But as she gets older, she will most likely feel pressure to conform to certain cultural norms and to forge her identity around what is considered feminine. Girls are supposed to be nice, sweet, and deferential. They are supposed to put the interests of others before their own. They are supposed to tame any wild streaks, to look prettyand to be objects of desire. For the individual girl, these expectations turn into voices she hears in her head, continually judging her and making her doubt her self-worth. These pressures may be subtler in our day and age, but they still exert a powerful influence. The more exploratory, aggressive, and darker sides of her character—both naturally occurring and absorbed from the father—will tend to become repressed and sink into the unconscious, if she adopts a more traditionally feminine role. (Greene, 2018)
Unconscious sexual identity
	•	The unconscious feminine part of the boy and the man is what Jung calls the anima. The unconscious masculine part of the girl and woman are the animus. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Because they are parts of ourselves that are deeply buried, we are never really aware of them in our daily life. But once we become fascinated with a person of the opposite sex, the anima and animus stir to life. The attraction we feel toward another might be purely physical, but more often the person who draws our attention unconsciously bears some resemblance—physical or psychological—to our mother or father. Remember that this primal relationship is full of charged energy, excitement, and obsessions that are repressed but yearning to come out. A person who triggers these associations in us will be a magnet for our attention, even though we are not aware of the source of our attraction. (Greene, 2018)
	•	If the relationship to the mother or father was mostly positive, we will tend to project onto the other person the desirable qualities that our parent had, in the hope of reexperiencing that early paradise. (Greene, 2018)
Identity Process Theory 
	•	Identity Process Theory (Breakwell, 1986, 1993, 2001a, 2014a, 2014b, 2014c, 2014d) is a theory of identity – it is concerned with the holistic analysis of the total identity of the person. It proposes that this identity will encompass elements that are dynamically derived from every aspect of the person’s experience – social category memberships, interpersonal relationships, social representational expo- sure, individual activity and observation, and so on. (Breakwell, 2014)
	•	IPT struggles to find a way of articulating the complex dynamic process of personhood that incorporates the personal and the social – the active, subjective conscious self and the objectified, known self. (Breakwell, 2014)
	•	At the core of IPT is the assertion that the person seeks to construct and maintain an identity – and that this process is orderly (in the sense that there appear to be relatively predictable states of identity that are sought). It is clearly argued that this identity comprises many elements (some derived from social category-membership; some derived from other aspects of experience within the social world). (Breakwell, 2014)
	•	IPT offers a framework for thinking about the development of the structure of identity. It proposes that the development of identity structures has to be seen as a process occupying the person’s whole lifespan. (Breakwell, 2014)
	•	It suggests that the characteristics of the human biological organism (capacity for memory, sensory features, rate of growth, etc.) interact with the social context to provide the material for identity construction. (Breakwell, 2014)
	•	It is argued that the neuro-cognitive capacities of the individual provide the ongoing core to identity processes. Essentially, the individual interprets experience and assimilates its implications into their identity. (Breakwell, 2014)
	•	The relatively simple model offered by IPT originally for the identity structure was that this core would operate through the lifespan and the content and evaluation dimensions of identity would develop as the individual aged. The implication was that both content and evaluation would accumulate and be organised. (Breakwell, 2014)
	•	IPT proposes that the individual’s identity is a dynamic social product of the interaction of the capacities for memory, consciousness and organised construal with the physical and societal structures and influence processes which constitute the social context. It proposes that identity resides in psychological processes but is manifested through thought, action and affect. (Breakwell, 2014)
	•	In IPT, the structure of identity is postulated to be regulated by the dynamic processes of accommodation/assimilation and evaluation which are deemed to be universal psychological processes. Assimilation and accommodation are two components of one process. (Breakwell, 2014)
	•	The two processes interact to determine the changing content and value of identity over time; with changing patterns of assimilation requiring changes in evaluation and vice versa. These two identity processes are said to be guided in their operation by principles which define desirable states for the structure of identity. (Breakwell, 2014)
	•	the original formulation of IPT claimed that currently in Western post-industrial cultures the three prime guidance principles discernible were desire for continuity, distinctiveness, and self-esteem. Later, a fourth guidance principle was added: efficacy. These four principles vary in their relative and absolute salience over time and across situations. (Breakwell, 2014)
	•	[…]IPT states that when distinctiveness, continuity, self-esteem or efficacy are at risk, the identity is threatened, and the individual will try to protect or regain them. 
	•	IPT links social representation and identity models to predict risk perceptions, and proposes that the extent to which any message about the risk will be received and incorporated into belief systems is affected by the ways in which this may threaten the individual’s identity (Breakwell, 2014e). (Breakwell, 2014)
	•	IPT (Breakwell, 1993) argues that identity requirements are important determi- nants of awareness, understanding, acceptance, assimilation and salience of social representations (and, by extension, of mental models of hazards).
	•	IPT postulates that individuals are motivated to achieve certain characteristics in their identity structure: continuity, distinctiveness, self-efficacy and self-esteem. (Breakwell, 2014)
	•	It suggests that the role of the specific representation of the hazard in maintaining the individual’s self-esteem, efficacy, continuity and distinctiveness should be identified. (Breakwell, 2014)
	•	This approach to risk communication is particularly relevant in the context of current societal concerns to access those members of the community who are typically unresponsive to general media campaigns (e.g. the elderly, those with disabilities, ethnic minorities, those with learning difficulties). This approach argues for a more differentiated approach to risk communication that takes systematic account of the personal and subcultural concerns of the target audience. (Breakwell, 2014)
	•	the social representation and identity process approach provides a framework within which such resistances to change in the mental model of the hazard can be analysed. It particularly points to the need to pay attention to the subcultural advantages of the existing mental model of the hazard when devising any intervention. (Breakwell, 2014)
	•	The two theories presented in this chapter (SRT and IPT) would seem together to offer a meta- theoretical structure that could be used by SARF researchers. These theories are targeted precisely at the factors that should determine the nature of amplifica- tion (including intensification, attenuation, representation, de-attenuation and de-intensification) and rippling processes. Used in conjunction, IPT and SRT range across the spectrum of intra-personal, group and intergroup processes that affect the development of the representation of the hazard and its subsequent secondary impacts. These theories will generate hypotheses that are testable within the SARF. (Breakwell, 2014)
Idea
	•	Ideas are not something apart from practice; concepts and classifications are the ideational building blocks of the practical domain. (Power, 2009)
	•	ideas can structure both practice and research, and scholarship may simply engage in the explication of concepts which originate in the practical field (Power, 2009)
	•	The constitutive significance of ideas is a matter of philosophical common-sense and, according to Wittgenstein (1976: 070), 'Concepts lead us to make investigation; are the expression of our interest, and direct our interest.' (Power, 2009)
	•	New ideas are performative in so far as they establish new normative climates for decision making and determine the way specific risk objects are 'conceptualized, identified, measured and managed' (Short, 1992: 4). (Power, 2009)
	•	the ideal is an ideational construct contradicting in itself and in contradiction with reality, but it has an irresistible power. The ideal is a practical fiction' (Vaihinger 1935) (Power, 2009)
	•	au point de vue social, la valeur hiérarchique d'une idée est sans importance. Ce qu'il faut considérer, ce sont les effets qu'elle produit. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	sous l'influence d'idées antérieures devenues des sentiments; et ce sont celles-là seules qui agissent sur les mobiles profonds de nos actes et de nos discours. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	lorsque, par des procédés divers, une idée a fini par pénétrer dans l'âme des foules, elle possède une puissance irrésistible et déroule toute une série d'effets qu'il faut subir. (Lebon, 1895)
Accidental ideas
	•	les idées accidentelles et passagères créées sous des influences du moment: l'engouement pour un individu ou une doctrine par exemple.  (Lebon, 1895)
Ideal designs
	•	Ideal designs and representations of practice are quick to diffuse and travel in varying degrees of rationalization and codification within laws and popular management texts (Power, 2009)
Fundamental ideas
	•	les idées fondamentales auxquelles le milieu, l'hérédité, l'opinion donnent une stabilité très grande: telles les croyances religieuses jadis, les idées démocratiques et sociales aujourd'hui. (Lebon, 1895)
Regulative ideas 
	•	For Kant, 'regulative ideas' underwrite the systematization and purpose of the form of enquiry that interested him—natural science. They are not derived from nature but are the condition of possibility of our 'interrogation' of nature. (Power, 2009)
	•	Put very simply, regulative ideas in Kant's sense, though fictional, constitute practices and processes of enquiry—not reality itself. They are methodological. (Power, 2009)
Unreal fictions
	•	‘unreal' fictions which are part of giving an immaculate account of how real practice can be. (Power, 2009)
Strategic ideas
	•	Strategic ideas with abstracted content provide the necessary conditions of reform discourses in the face of 'permanently failing' organizations. (Power, 2009)
Prestigious idea
	•	Ce qui contribue surtout à donner aux idées propagées par l'affirmation, la répétition et la contagion, une puissance très grande, c'est qu'elles finissent par acquérir le pouvoir mystérieux nommé prestige. (Lebon, 1895)
Primed ideas
	•	primed ideas have some ability to prime other ideas, although more weakly. (Kahneman, 2012)  
	•	priming is not restricted to concepts and words. (Kahneman, 2012)  
	•	Priming phenomena arise in System 1, and you have no conscious access to them. (Kahneman, 2012)   
	•	We know from studies of priming that unnoticed stimuli in our environment have a substantial influence on our thoughts and actions. (Kahneman, 2012)  
Ideomotor effect
	•	This remarkable priming phenomenon—the influencing of an action by the idea—is known as the ideomotor effect. (Kahneman, 2012)  
New idea
	•	A new idea is the beginning, not the end, of the creative process. It must jump over many hurdles before being embraced as an organizational product or solution. The organizational climate plays a crucial role in determining whether new ideas bubble to the surface or are suppressed. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	New ideas are, by definition, unconventional, and therefore likely to be suppressed, either consciously or unconsciously, unless they are born in a secure and protected environment. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	A new idea is not the end product of the creative process. Rather, it is the beginning of what is sometimes a long and tortuous process of translating an idea into an innovative product. The idea must be developed, evaluated, and communicated to others, and this process is influenced by the organizational setting in which it transpires.  (Heuer, 1999)
	•	The potentially useful new idea must pass over a number of hurdles before it is embraced as an organizational product. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	A questioning attitude is a prerequisite to a successful search for new ideas. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Another prerequisite to creativity is sufficient strength of character to suggest new ideas to others, possibly at the expense of being rejected or even ridiculed on occasion. (Heuer, 1999)
Idea generation
	•	Idea generation should be a freewheeling, unconstrained, uncritical process. (Heuer, 1999)
Ideology
	•	Ideology is the basis of the thought of a class society within the conflictual course of history. (Debord, 2012)
	•	There's nothing inherently wrong with ideology; we need ideology to maintain a meaningful social life. But when ideology is represented as if it were science or knowledge it obscures the constructed, artificial nature of expertise, prediction, and discovery. (Clarke, 1999)
	•	Il faut donc s’attendre, à partir de là, à une certaine intolérance de la part du groupe. Surtout si l’on accepte l’idée que le groupe recherche toujours, à travers l’idéologie religieuse ou politique qu’il se fixe, une certaine image de lui-même où il puisse s’appréhender et se livrer aux délices du narcissisme. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	à travers les postulations d’idéaux divers une entité est perpétuellement en quête d’elle-même. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	la réalité apporte souvent des déceptions inévitables puisque la nature profonde de ces programmes est selon l’imaginaire. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	A moins qu’un régime totalitaire ne vienne au secours de l’idéal pour lui apporter les redoutables certitudes que l’on sait. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	contrôle social est alors total. (Mannoni, 1985)
Ideological motivations
	•	Ideological motivations are linked to philosophical beliefs. (Vellani, 2007)
Ideational implementation
	•	ideational implementation; organizational actors engage in definitional work as part of efforts to organize concrete practices and routines to manage risk objects. They produce a world in which conceptual objects of governance, organization, risk, and management are being continuously co-defined. Specifically, they construct an idea of risk governance which demands the rational design of risk management process. (Power, 2009)
Incapacity 
	•	Incapacity is “the characteristics of a person or group and their situation that influence their capacity to anticipate, cope with, resist, and recorver from the impact (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Declining, unstable, or inequitable economies suggest incapacity. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	In theory, incapacity suggests insecurity. In practice, small declines in capacity can lead to dramatic, nonlinear declines in security. In absolute terms, people without sufficient capacity do not have the potential to counter anything. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Incapacity tends to correlate with expose, vulnerability, and other concepts suggestive of insecurity, and these things to be highly interrelated. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	People with incapacity cannot acquire any of those controls, so when the same event occurs for them, the negative returns are many times higher – they suffer a disaster or catastophe. (Newsome, 2013)
Relative incapacity
	•	Relative incapacity suggest a dramatic, nonlinear jump in the negative returns of an event. (Newsome, 2013)
Indifference curve
	•	Each “indifference curve” connects the combinations of the two goods that are equally desirable—they have the same utility. The curves would turn into parallel straight lines if people were willing to “sell” vacation days for extra income at the same price regardless of how much income and how much vacation time they have. The convex shape indicates diminishing marginal utility: the more leisure you have, the less you care for an extra day of it, and each added day is worth less than the one before. Similarly, the more income you have, the less you care for an extra dollar, and the amount you are willing to give up for an extra day of leisure increases. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	The representation of indifference curves implicitly assumes that your utility at any given moment is determined entirely by your present situation, that the past is irrelevant, and that your evaluation of a possible job does not depend on the terms of your current job. These assumptions are completely unrealistic in this case and in many others. (Kahneman, 2012)
Industrial relations
	•	Industril relations concerns the interactions between and among employees and employers, and often involves organized labour unions. (Furnham, 2005)
Information bias
	•	Another systematic problem that can undermine a study is information bias, which can take many forms, although the most common is the mis- classification of exposure estimates. (Michaels, 2008)
Injury
	•	An injury is any damage to the body. (Wound implies a puncture wound or an injury due to violence). (Newsome, 2013)
	•	An injury could cause death, but normally we measure deaths and survivable injuries separately. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Injuries can be measured as a rate, as a frequency, by number on the body, and on a scale (normally described by severity). (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Injuries can be categorized by location on or in the body, medical cause (for instance, toxic, traumatic), or event (for instance, road traddic accident, sports). (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Injuries, like deaths, have economic value in the tort system and health system. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	
Illusion
	•	A reliable way to make people believe in falsehoods is frequent repetition, because familiarity is not easily distinguished from truth. Authoritarian institutions and marketers have always known this fact. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	illusion only is sacred, truth profane. (Debord, 2012)
	•	the highest degree of illusion comes to be the highest degree of sacredness. (Debord, 2012)
Collective illusion
	•	La création des légendes qui circulent si aisément dans les foules n'est pas déterminée seulement par une crédulité complète. Elle l'est encore par les déformations prodigieuses que subissent les événements dans l'imagination de gens assemblés. L'événement le plus simple vu par la foule est bientôt un événement transformé. Elle pense par images, et l'image évoquée en évoque elle-même une série d'autres n'ayant aucun lien logique avec la première. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	La raison nous montre ce que dans ces images il y a d'incohérence, mais la foule ne le voit guère; et ce que son imagination déformante ajoute à l'événement réel, elle le confondra avec lui. La foule ne sépare guère le subjectif de l'objectif. Elle admet comme réelles les images évoquées dans son esprit, et qui le plus souvent n'ont qu'une parenté lointaine avec le fait observé. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Dans cet exemple on voit se dérouler bien clairement le mécanisme de l'hallucination collective tel que nous l'avons expliqué. D'un côté, une foule en état d'attention expectante; de l'autre, une suggestion faite par la vigie signalant un bâtiment désemparé en mer, suggestion qui, par voie de contagion, fut acceptée par tous les assistants, officiers ou matelots. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Dès que quelques individus sont réunis, ils constituent une foule, et, alors même qu'ils seraient des savants distingués, ils prennent tous les caractères des foules pour ce qui est en dehors de leur spécialité. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	le point de départ de la suggestion est toujours l'illusion produite chez un individu par des réminiscences plus ou moins vagues, puis la contagion par voie d'affirmation de cette illusion primitive. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Ce que l'observateur voit alors, ce n'est plus l'objet lui-même, mais l'image évoquée dans son esprit. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	observations collectives sont les plus erronées de toutes et que le plus souvent elles représentent simplement l'illusion d'un individu qui, par voie de contagion, a suggestionné les autres. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	les foules ont toujours subi l'influence des illusions. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Qui sait les illusionner est aisément leur maître; qui tente de les désillusionner est toujours leur victime. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	L'expérience constitue à peu près le seul procédé efficace pour établir solidement une vérité dans l'âme des foules, et détruire des illusions devenues trop dangereuses. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	L'expérience constitue à peu près le seul procédé efficace pour établir solidement une vérité dans l'âme des foules, et détruire des illusions devenues trop dangereuses. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Leur seule utilité est de prouver à quel point les expériences doivent être répétées d'âge en âge pour exercer quelque influence, et réussir à ébranler seulement une erreur lorsqu'elle est solidement implantée dans l'âme des foules. (Lebon, 1895)
Truth illusions
	•	truth illusions provide specific suggestions that may help you achieve this goal. The general principle is that anything you can do to reduce cognitive strain will help, so you should first maximize legibility. (Kahneman, 2012)
Illusory correlation
	•	the subjects markedly overestimated the frequency of co-occurrence of natural associates, such as suspiciousness and peculiar eye (Tversky and Kahneman, 1974)
	•	Availability provides a natural account for the illusory-correlation effect. (Tversky and Kahneman, 1974)
Image
	•	image is an extrinsically oriented perspective that connects the self with its audience in a certain relationship (Shih, 2012) 
Cognitive image
	•	The Orthodox argue that the use of images affects cognitive processes. Richard Nisbett and Lee Ross have found that people may form an image upon first impression and on the basis of relatively little information. (Honig, 2007)
	•	Once analysts have an image, they find it very difficult to change it, because it governs their perception of additional information. (Honig, 2007)
	•	an image created following the last victory blinds analysts from perceiving changes in an enemy’s military capabilities. (Honig, 2007)
	•	Revisionists respond, however, that a full explanation for the impact of these images must take into account analysts’ cultural prejudices. They argue that when analysts follow their professional norms and insulate themselves from their society’s prejudices, biased images can have significantly less effect. (Honig, 2007)
Image repair theory
	•	Image Repair Theory explains how individuals and organizations attempt to correct negative public perception of themselves after a specific event or series of events.  (Harlow et al., 2011)
	•	it is frequently cited as the basis for understanding the response to crisis situations (Harlow et al., 2011)
	•	corporate image repair strategies often change as a crisis progresses through various stages. (Harlow et al., 2011)
	•	Corporate image repair strategies may change as a crisis progresses through various stages. (Harlow et al., 2011)
Initial image repair strategies
	•	Initial strategies are more likely to emerge from existing emergency management plans that attempt to address all possible scenarios. Even the best emergency management plan, however, will overlook something because the precise details of an emergency and its social context are unknowable. 
	•	initial image repair strategies may have an element of improvisation precisely when public and media attention are most focused on the organization and its communicative practices, and when the organization’s image is most vulnerable. 
Imaginability
	•	Imaginability plays an important role in the evaluation of probabilities in real-life situations. (Tversky and Kahneman, 1974)
Immunization
	•	Ideally, almost all the population should be immunized to block the infection completely. However, if we can immunize just a fraction, it is not a good idea to choose people at random. Most of the times, choosing at random implies selecting individuals with a relatively low number of connections. Even if they block the disease from spreading in their surroundings, hubs will always be there to put it back into circulation. A much better strategy would be to target hubs. Inmunizing hubs is like deleting them from the network, and the studies on targeted attacks show that eliminating a small fraction of hubs fragments themad cow syndromeegu network: thus, the disease will be confined to a few isolated components. This strategy faces a practical problem: nobody really knows the full map of social connections of a human group, so it is hard to identify its hubs. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
Hub immunization
	•	a clever tactic to find them was suggested in 2003 by physicists Reuven Cohen, Shlomo Havlin, and Daniel ben-Avraham: they suggested selecting people at random and asking them the name of somebody they are connected with. The most repeated names in this list are most likely the hubs of the social network: in fact, for its many connections, a hub will be tied to many people, so it will probably be mentioned by many of those interviewed. It should be noted that immunizing hubs works perfectly in theory, but many real-world details could impair it, such as whether the network disposes of specially redundant paths that go around hubs, or whether the network of contacts is fixed in time or evolving. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
Impatiance
	•	Looking back on our life, we see that we have a tendency to be impatient and to overreact; we notice patterns of behavior over long periods of time that elude us in the moment but become clearer to us later on. (Greene, 2018)
	•	What this means is that in the present moment we lack perspective. With the passage of time, we gain more information and see more of the truth; what was invisible to us in the present now becomes visible in retrospect. Time is the greatest teacher of them all, the revealer of reality. (Greene, 2018)
Impression
	•	Impressions tend to persist even after the evidence that created those impressions has been fully discredited. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	The ambiguity of most real-world situations contributes to the operation of this perseverance phenomenon. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	It is easy to rationalize maintaining these impressions by arguing that the informa- tion was true despite the source being under control, or by doubting the validity of the report claiming the source to be under control. In the latter case, the perseverance of the impression may itself affect evaluation of the evidence that supposedly discredits the impression. (Heuer, 1999)
First impression
	•	It has been demonstrated how much people tend to judge based on first impressions and the difficulties they have in reassessing these judgments. Knowing this, you must give extra attention to your first appearance before an individual or group. In general it is best to tone down your nonverbal cues and present a more neutral front. Too much excitement will signal insecurity and might make people suspicious. A relaxed smile, however, and looking people in the eye in these first encounters can do wonders for lowering their natural resistance. (Greene, 2018)
	•	mais ne vous en tenez pas à une première expérience : comme en toute chose, il faut habituer les sens à une impression nouvelle, douce ou violente, triste ou joyeuse. (Dumas, 1998)
Incident
	•	We use the term incident for disruptions at the first or second level (Perrow, 1999)
	•	An incident involves damage that is limited to parts or a unit, whether the failure disrupt the system or not (Perrow, 1999)
	•	Incidents involved damage to or failures of parts or a unit only, even though the failure may stop the output of the systemor affect it to the extent that it must be stopped. (Perrow, 1999)
	•	Incidents are overwhelmingly the most common untoward system events. (Perrow, 1999)
	•	An incident includes all undesired circumstances and near misses which have the potential to cause accidents. (Wells, 1996)
	•	The immediate causes of an incident include factors such as: action by plant personnel inadequate; defects directly cause loss of plant integrity; plant or equipment inadequate or inoperable; control system or emergency control inadequate; change from design intent at any point in the plant life cycle: environment and external causes of disturbance. (Wells, 1996)
	•	An issue or an incident is an event that requires a response. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	[…] an incident is either “an occurrence” or “a disruptive, usually dangerous or unfortunate event” (FrameNet). (Newsome, 2013)

Incubation theory
	•	'incubation theory' refers to the analysis of potentially deviant normalities embodied in routine patterns of activity which inhibit intelligent risk processing. Crises and catastrophes do not just happen suddenly; they are in an important sense 'organized' and have their origins in failures of management and intelligence processes (Vaughan, 1996) (Power, 2009)
Industrial era
	•	The industrial era, by contrast, had a very uncomplicated view of life, especially humanity’s relationship with nature. (Coker, 2009)
Inadequate normal control
	•	inadequate normal control corresponds to the failure of the normal control system to correct the trend for any reason, including the failure to provide such as control system. This may be effected automatically or by action by operators, either maintenance or production. Clearly detection of the change is important (Wells, 1996)
Inclination
	•	They are forces within us that come from a deeper place than conscious words can express. (Greene, 2014)
	•	In moments when we engage in an activity that corresponds to our deepest inclinations, we might experience a touch of this: We feel as if the words we write or the physical movements we perform come so quickly and easily that they are coming from outside us. We are literally “inspired,” the Latin word meaning something from the outside breathing within us. (Greene, 2014)
	•	What weakens this force, what makes you not feel it or even doubt its existence, is the degree to which you have succumbed to another force in life—social pressures to conform. (Greene, 2014)
	•	The process of realizing your Life’s Task comes in three stages: First, you must connect or reconnect with your inclinations, that sense of uniqueness. The first step then is always inward. You search the past for signs of that inner voice or force. You clear away the other voices that might confuse you—parents and peers. You look for an underlying pattern, a core to your character that you must understand as deeply as possible. (Greene, 2014)
	•	The importance of recognizing these preverbal inclinations is that they are clear indications of an attraction that is not infected by the desires of other people. (Greene, 2014)
	•	your character was set in your earliest years (see chapter 4), along with your inclinations toward certain activities, your likes and dislikes. As you get older, this character only becomes more apparent. Feeling organically connected to who you were in the past gives you a strong sense of identity. You know what you like and dislike, you know who you are. This will help you maintain your self- love, which is so critical in resisting the descent into deep narcissism and in helping you to develop empathy (see chapter 2). Also, you will pay greater attention to the mistakes and lessons of the past, which those who are locked in the present tend to repress. (Greene, 2018)
Incompetence
	•	Incompetence is a vitally important but minimally explored variable in organization theory. (Ott and Shafritz, 1994)
	•	Incompetence is an extraordinarily complex phenomenon because it is not a single "thing" at all. (Ott and Shafritz, 1994)
	•	incompetence provides justification for damaging behaviors, particularly as it gains pervasive acceptance as a reality. (Ott and Shafritz, 1994)
	•	the term incompetence is neither neutral nor value free. It is an emotion-laden statement about systemic failure. (Ott and Shafritz, 1994)
	•	incompetence involves patterns of seemingly avoidable bad decisions or unwise actions. (Ott and Shafritz, 1994)
	•	Because incompetence is a social construct, each member of the worldwide society of organization dwellers will someday, by someone, be perceived as incompe- tent-whether justified or not. (Ott and Shafritz, 1994)
Organizational incompetence
	•	Organizational incompetence both as a social construct and as an "objective" reality. (Ott and Shafritz, 1994)
	•	Organizational incompetence cannot be seen directly. (Ott and Shafritz, 1994)
	•	To the extent that organizational incompetence is a social construct, the reality of incompetence in government organizations reflects the level of public receptivity to characterizations made by the mass media, opinion leaders, and politicians-perhaps more than it does the actual quality of organizational performance or decisions. (Ott and Shafritz, 1994)
	•	organizational incompetence, concerns the failure of organizations and executives to avert, ameliorate, or reverse externally caused decline (Cameron, Sutton and Whetten, 1988; Guy, 1989)-failure to learn from their environment. (Ott and Shafritz, 1994)
	•	organizational incompetence is a construct, a variable state of being that exists in peoples' minds and emotions. (Ott and Shafritz, 1994)
	•	rganizational incompetence is 'played out" in repeated patterns of what appear to be avoidable bad decisions or unwise actions. (Ott and Shafritz, 1994)
	•	The perception of an organization's incompetence depends as much upon our receptivity to characterizations made by the mass media and politicians as upon its actual behaviors or decisions. (Ott and Shafritz, 1994)
	•	organizational incompetence is more than a failure to accomplish goals or ineffectiveness. It is a variable state of systemic failure and holistic unworthiness. (Ott and Shafritz, 1994)
	•	organizational competence and incompetence vary in degree and pervasiveness. (Ott and Shafritz, 1994)
	•	organizational incompetence has its roots in and is sustained by culture. (Ott and Shafritz, 1994)
	•	The objective reality of organizational incompetence is rooted in organizational culture; the perception of organizational incompetence is rooted in generally prevailing cultural assumptions. (Ott and Shafritz, 1994)
	•	Organizational incompetence is changed by altering organizational culture, not individuals. (Ott and Shafritz, 1994)
	•	organizational incompetence may not always be the opposite of organizational competence. Instead, the opposite of incompetence may be no incompetence. (Ott and Shafritz, 1994)
	•	rganizational incompetence is somewhat analogous to pathologies that develop in subsystems of all complex (living) open systems, and thus that can be diagnosed and treated. (Ott and Shafritz, 1994)
	•	ganizational incompetence involves inability or unwillingness to learn from mistakes and from the environment. (Ott and Shafritz, 1994)
	•	Like stupidity, organizational incompetence has epistemological, social/cultural, and moral dimensions. (Ott and Shafritz, 1994)
	•	Organizational incompetence involves issues and questions of organizational power, adaptation, pattern maintenance, learning, survival, social justice, and worth. (Ott and Shafritz, 1994)

Military incompetence 
	•	Military incompetence has received considerable attention from historians and students of strategy. (Ott and Shafritz, 1994)
Peter Principle
	•	In a bureaucracy, all employees rise to their level of incompetence. "In time, every post tends to be occupied by an employee who is incompetent to carry out its duties.". (Ott and Shafritz, 1994)
	•	The Peter Principle constitutes the only known attempt to develop a general theory of incompetence. (Ott and Shafritz, 1994)
Indigenous technical knowledge
	•	Anthropologists often use ‘indigenous technical knowledge’ to describe non specialists’ unique understanding of how their world work. (Fischhoff, 1995)
Inference
	•	In more formal analysis, inferences are made through procedures that collectively comprise the scientific method. The scientist advances a hypothesis, then tests this hypothesis by the collection and statistical analysis of data on many instances of the phenomenon in question. Even then, causality cannot be proved beyond all possible doubt. (Heuer, 1999)

Information
	•	Information does not constitute knowledge (Stilgoe et al., 2006)
	•	People are also more likely to remember information presented at the highest level of a hierarchy. (Atman et al., 1994)
	•	People by nature will impose coherence onto new information that they receive, incorporating it into their existing knowledge in an effort to interpret it. Scant prior understanding of a problem can easily lead people to make inaccurate assumptions or draw unwarranted conclusions in making sense of new information. To the extent that new facts do not fit coherently into people’s existing understanding of the world—a common occurrence if their understanding is flawed—the new information will be harder for them to understand and believe (15). (Downs, 2014)
	•	Information is incredibly powerful. (Michaels, 2008)
	•	Information presented in vivid and concrete detail often has unwarranted impact, and people tend to disregard abstract or statistical information that may have greater evidential value. We seldom take the absence of evidence into account. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	information that is vivid, concrete, and personal has a greater impact on our thinking than pallid, abstract information that may actually have substantially greater value as evidence. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Information that people perceive directly, that they hear with their own ears or see with their own eyes, is likely to have greater impact than information received secondhand that may have greater evidential value. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Events that people experience personally are more memorable than those they only read about. Concrete words are easier to remember than abstract words, and words of all types are easier to recall than numbers. In short, information having the qualities cited in the preceding para- graph is more likely to attract and hold our attention. It is more likely to be stored and remembered than abstract reasoning or statistical sum- maries, and therefore can be expected to have a greater immediate effect as well as a continuing impact on our thinking in the future. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Using experts in a variety of fields as test subjects, experimental psychologists have examined the relationship between the amount of information available to the experts, the accuracy of judgments they make based on this information, and the experts’ confidence in the accuracy of these judgments. The word “information,” as used in this context, refers to the totality of material an analyst has available to work with in making a judgment. (Heuer, 1999)

The word “information,” as used in this context, refers to the totality of material an analyst has available to work with in making a judgment. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	In accordance with ADP 6-0, information is, in the context of decision making, data that has been organized and processed in order to provide context for further analysis (ADP 6-0).  (Army Publishing Directorate, 2020)
	•	Information generally provides some of the answers to the who, what, where, when, why, and how questions. (Army Publishing Directorate, 2020)
Variable disjunction of information
	•	He defines variable disjunction of information as a state facing an organization of high complexity and uncertainty for which there is no single authoritative description. Individual in the organization have access to different sets of information and each tends to construct different theories about problems and solutions. Scarcities of time, money and energy prevent adequate handling of information which might reconcile conflicting aspect of various sets of information. Consequently information gathering, processing, distribution and communication are selective and diverse across elements of the organization. (Stech, 1979)
Information vacuum
	•	An information vacuum that continues for almost a year long. (Lofstedt, 2008)
	•	The information vacuum resulting in the story going to press without EFSA refutation, itself enhanced by the ripple effects […]. (Lofstedt, 2008)
Conflicting information
	•	Conflicting information of uncertain reliability is endemic to intelligence analysis, as is the need to make rapid judgments on current events even before all the evidence is in. (Heuer, 1999)
Erroneous information
	•	If erroneous information sources find ready access to the mass media without effective antidotes, then large social impacts, even for minor events, become en- tirely possible. (Kasperson et al., 1988)
Information accuracy
	•	There are many reasons why information often is less than perfectly accurate: misunderstanding, misperception, or having only part of the story; bias on the part of the ultimate source; distortion in the reporting chain from subsource through source, case officer, reports officer, to analyst; or misunderstanding and misperception by the analyst. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	much of the evidence analysts bring to bear in conducting analysis is retrieved from memory, but analysts often cannot remember even the source of information they have in memory let alone the degree of certainty they attributed to the accuracy of that information when it was first received. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Analysts must consider many items of evidence with different degrees of accuracy and reliability that are related in complex ways with varying degrees of probability to several potential outcomes. Clearly, one cannot make neat mathematical calculations that take all of these probabilistic relationships into account. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Remember that greater control over events will come from realistic assessments of the situation, precisely what is made most difficult by a brain submerged in trivia. (Greene, 2018)
Information assimilation
	•	Assimilating too much information leads to mental fatigue, confusion, and feelings of helplessness. Everything begins to seem equally important—the placement of toilets and a possible war with the Turks. What you need is a mental filtering system based on a scale of priorities and your long-term goals. Knowing what you want to accomplish in the end will help you weed out the essential from the nonessential. You do not have to know all the details. Sometimes you need to delegate—let your subordinates handle the information gathering. Remember that greater control over events will come from realistic assessments of the situation, precisely what is made most difficult by a brain submerged in trivia. (Greene, 2018)
Information content 
	•	One of the insights of chaos is to focus on information content. In linear systems variance reflects information content. Information content is more subtle in nonlinear systems, where size is not the only indicator of importance. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
Information flow
	•	Independent of the accuracy and particular content of information, large volume of information flow may serve as a risk amplifier. (Kasperson et al., 1988)
	•	Repeated stories, of course, direct public attention toward particular risk problems and away from competing sources of attention. (Kasperson et al., 1988) 
Information gathering
	•	Sometimes you need to delegate—let your subordinates handle the information gathering. Remember that greater control over events will come from realistic assessments of the situation, precisely what is made most difficult by a brain submerged in trivia. (Greene, 2018)
Information-processing
	•	speed is essential in information-processing, which has been speeding up all the time. (Coker, 2009)
	•	The merits of networks over hierarchies is to be found in the superiority of distributed information-processing. (Coker, 2009)
	•	If information does not fit into what people know, or think they know, they have great difficulty processing it. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Knowing that the information comes from an uncontrolled source who may be trying to manipulate us does not necessarily reduce the impact of the information. (Heuer, 1999)
Best guess strategy
	•	In processing information of uncertain accuracy or reliability, analysts tend to make a simple yes or no decision. If they reject the evidence, they tend to reject it fully, so it plays no further role in their mental calculations. If they accept the evidence, they tend to accept it wholly, ignoring the probabilistic nature of the accuracy or reliability judgment. This is called a “best guess” strategy. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Such a strategy simplifies the integration of probabilistic information, but at the expense of ignoring some of the uncertainty. If analysts have information about which they are 70- or 80-percent certain but treat this information as though it were 100-percent certain, judgments based on that information will be overconfident. (Heuer, 1999)

Guess strategy
	•	For example, available evidence may indicate that an event probably (75 percent) will occur, but the ana- lyst cannot be certain that the evidence on which this judgment is based is wholly accurate or reliable. Therefore, the analyst reduces the assessed probability of the event (say, down to 60 percent) to take into account the uncertainty concerning the evidence. This is an improvement over the best-guess strategy but generally still results in judgments that are overconfident when compared with the mathematical formula for calcu- lating probabilities. (Heuer, 1999)

Information environement
	•	information environment is its diversity—multiple sources, each with varying degrees of reliability, and each commonly reporting information which by itself is incomplete and sometimes inconsistent or even incompatible with reporting from other sources. (Heuer, 1999)
Information sources
	•	The problem of indirect or inferential information sources is com- pounded by the lack of redundancy available to complex systems. If we stopped to notice, we would observe that our daily life is full of missed or misunderstood signals and faulty information. (Perrow, 1999)
	•	We should not be surprised, then, if ambiguous or indirect information sources in complex systems are subject to misinterpretation. (Perrow, 1999)
	•	An information source sends out a cluster of signals (which form a message) to a transmitter, or directly to the receiver. The signals are decoded by the transmitter or receiver so that the message can be understood. Each transmitter alters the original message by intensifying or attenuating some incoming signals, adding or deleting others, and sending a new cluster of signals on to the next transmitter or the final receiver where the next stage of decoding occurs. (Kasperson et al., 1988)
	•	Sources and signals are not independent entities but are perceived as a unit by the receiver who links the signal to the sources or transmitters and draws inferences about the relationship between the two. (Kasperson et al., 1988)
Information spreading
	•	Naturally, the contagion of behaviours, as well as rumours and ideas, is different in many respects from that of diseases. Unlike contagion, the act of spreading information is necessarily intentional. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
Mutual information
	•	Mutual Information, for instance, reflects how many bits of Y you learn, on average, when you learn another bit of X. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
	•	map? Mutual Information will reflect the fact that knowing one value of X exactly gives us complete information on future values of X. While given a finite precision measurement of X, Mutual Information reflects how much we know, on average, about a future measurement of X. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
	•	In the presence of observational noise we would tend to know less about future values of X the further they fall in the future since the corresponding bits of the current value of X will be obscured by the noise. So Mutual Information tends to decay as the separation in time increases, while the linear correlation coefficient is zero for all separations (except zero). Mutual Information is one useful tool; the development of custom-made statistics to use in particular applications is a growth industry within nonlinear dynamics. It is important to know exactly what these new statistics are telling us, and it is equally important to accept that there is more to say than traditional statistics can tell us. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
Secondhand information
	•	Intelligence analysts generally work with secondhand information. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	hen an abstract theory or secondhand report is contradicted by personal observation, the lat- ter properly prevails under most circumstances. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	There are a number of popular adages that advise mistrust of secondhand data: “Don’t believe everything you read,” “You can prove anything with statistics,” “Seeing is believing,” “I’m from Missouri...” (Heuer, 1999)
Positive information
	•	It is our natural tendency to fixate on positive information, to notice only what we can see and hear. (Greene, 2014)
Information overload
	•	According to Mark Kauppi, information overload is also a problem for counterterrorist analysts: “there is too much intelligence. A veritable flood comes in each day as message traffic, and then there is the vast amount of finished intelligence products available through government intranets. An analyst could easily spend all day doing nothing but reading intelligence and not actually producing anything. But being an analyst, by definition, requires an effort to make sense of the pieces of the terrorist puzzle and provide value-added analysis.” (Marrin, 2002)
Information security
	•	Information Security (or Information Assurance) needs to be viewed through the lens of business context to see the added value of basing your security program on a risk model. (Wheeler, 2011)
	•	Risk management is by no means a ubiquitous foundation for information security programs, but many visionaries in the field recognize that the future of information security has to be focused on risk decisions if we are to have any hope of combating the ever-changing threat landscape and constantly increasing business demands. (Wheeler, 2011)
	•	The goal of Information Security must be to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, availability, and accountability of the resources for which we are responsible. (Wheeler, 2011)
	•	The first rule of Information Security should always be that considering controls and procedures to increase security should never come at the expense of human safety. (Wheeler, 2011)
Inherent safety 
	•	Inherent safety, also called primary prevention, consists in the elimination of a hazard. It is contrasted with secondary prevention that consists in reducing the risk associated with a hazard. (Swedish Chemicals Agency et al., 2007)
	•	Proponents of inherent safety have shown that other things being equal, elimination of a hazard is a better option than to retain it and construct safeguards against it. The major reason for this is that as long as the hazard still exists, it can be realized by some unanticipated triggering event. (Swedish Chemicals Agency et al., 2007)
	•	Inherent safety, also called primary prevention, consists in the elimination of a hazard. (Swedish Chemicals Agency et al., 2007)
	•	Inherent safety would consist in replacing them by non-inflammable materials. (Swedish Chemicals Agency et al., 2007)
	•	Although inherent safety is the most common term, some authors prefer “inherently safer design”. The motivation for this is that (full) safety can never be achieved. An inherently safe plant does not exist. It is therefore more constructive to think in terms of inherently safer processes. (Swedish Chemicals Agency et al., 2007)
	•	Inherent safety is one of the safety principles with general applicability that are based on this type of thinking about uncertainty. (Swedish Chemicals Agency et al., 2007)
	•	Proponents of inherent safety have shown that other things being equal, elimination of a hazard is a better option than to retain it and construct safeguards against it. The major reason for this is that as long as the hazard still exists, it can be realized by some unanticipated triggering event. Even with the best of control measures, some unforeseen chain of events can give rise to an unforeseen exposure. Even the best add-on safety technology can fail, or be destroyed in the course of an accident. (Swedish Chemicals Agency et al., 2007)
	•	The goals of inherent safety in the chemical industry have been adequately summarized by Faisal Khan and co- workers: “The salient features of an inherently safe plant are: - it uses harmless materials,- it contains small inventories of hazardous materials insufficient to cause significant harm even if released, and- the hazardous material is held in forms or under conditions that render them effectively harmless (diluted, at ambient temperature and pressure, etc.)”. (Swedish Chemicals Agency et al., 2007)
Information sharing
	•	Information sharing is necessary because terrorists cross national boundaries in planning and implementing their attacks. (Marrin, 2002)
	•	The varied collection authorities leads foreign and domestic agencies to collect different kinds of information and to classify it at different levels, resulting in complications reconciling the exchange and sharing of information. (Marrin, 2002)
	•	agencies often fail to circulate information because it does not meet a perceived threshold of importance. (Marrin, 2002)
	•	In CTC, “information is ...exchanged between agencies via several telecommunications systems that have dramatically decreased the lag time experienced between the receipt of terrorist threat information and the dissemination of that information to Federal, state, and local intelligence/law enforcement agencies.” (Marrin, 2002)
Infrastructure
Critical infrastructure
	•	Large-scale power outages reveal the connectedness of power grids. These systems deliver electricity across large distances from central points to cities and industrial areas. Carefully planned in the beginning, they grow more and more intricate over time. Nowadays, generators, transformers, and substations, connected by high-voltage transmission lines, constitute a network that spans several regions and often several countries (as the 2003 example shows). It is clear that such networks require careful maintenance to prevent criticalities. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
	•	A minimal malfunction in such an infrastructure has major consequences. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
Institutionalization
	•	C’est alors qu’intervient le processus de l’institutionnalisation dont un des buts primordiaux est de fixer la forme de la « communion » par un ensemble de rites. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	le rite est « un acte qui peut être individuel ou collectif mais qui, toujours, lors même qu’il est assez souple pour comporter une marge d’improvisation, reste fidèle à certaines règles qui, précisément, constituent ce qu’il y a en lui de rituel », et, ajoute notre auteur, « la répétition est donnée dans l’essence même du rite ». (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	itératif et réglé ne peut s’expliquer par le hasard et remplit une fonction importante. Celle-ci semble devoir être recherchée du côté de la tendance à l’uniformité, à l’ordre et à la cohésion. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Point de vue qui appelle à un élargissement de notre perspective et à une assimilation des fêtes, célébrations et commémorations aux rites, l’ensemble constituant les traditions. (Mannoni, 1985)
Institutional geography
	•	Institutional geography can vary in features such as scale, from international through national to local jurisdication; integration, from a single agency handling all features of regulation to highlu fragmented administration and complex overlapping systems controlling related aspects of a risk; and specialization, from risl-specific and hazad-specific expertise to general-purpose administration. (Hood et al., 2001)
Insitutional memory
	•	People retire, die, and their personal comprehension of what should be done and why, dies with them. Institutional memory endures a little longer, but even that tends soon to move into a half-life condition, as it ages rather than matures. (Gray, 2014)
Integrity
	•	You cannot order integrity, you cannot demand that a culture preserve its ethics. (Gates, 1992)
	•	Let me conclude then by simply reiterating that the absolute integrity of our analysis is the most important of the core values of the Central Intelligence Agency. (Gates, 1992)
Intelligence
	•	intelligence depends on the ability to absorb the lessons and ideas of those who are older and wiser. (Greene, 2018)
Intelligence (domain)
	•	intelligence has to achieve empathy with its users, as well as its targets. (Herman, 1996, p.110)
	•	For many, the purpose of intelligence is simply to provide accurate information; (Dahl, 2013)
	•	most experts believe that in order for intelligence to be worthwhile, it must have some value to action and policy. (Dahl, 2013)
	•	A deputy director of the CIA, for example, once defined intelligence as ‘‘knowledge and analysis designed to assist action.’’ (Dahl, 2013)
	•	in the words of the British intelligence expert R. V. Jones, ‘‘The ultimate object of Intelligence is to enable action to be optimized.’’ (Dahl, 2013)
	•	circumstances can sometimes make policy serve intelligence. (Betts, 2007)
	•	The use of intelligence depends less on the bureaucracy than on the intellects and inclination of the authorities above it. (Betts, 2007)
	•	informed decision making requires assessing tactical effectiveness to adapt strategy and options. (Betts, 2007)
	•	The main task in using intelligence to develop doctrines and forces for deterrence and defense is to estimate threats posed by adversaries, in terms of both capabilities and intentions, over a period of several years. (Betts, 2007)
	•	Intelligence can’t live with theory and can’t live without it. (Betts, 2007)
	•	We know that the absence of reliable intelligence and understanding at times of security threats will limit the options open to government in trying to protect the public.  (Omand, 2014)
	•	intelligence work is to be accepted as a legitimate function of government. (Omand, 2014)
	•	Intelligence and understanding is in this view the starting point (although of course very far from sufficient) to make good government possible, through both justice and security. (Omand, 2014)
	•	inclusive approach to national security where the aim is to manage the risks of natural hazards as well as man-made threats. (Omand, 2014)
	•	Even given strategic notice and good intelligence, there will be some threats and hazards that cannot be headed off. (Omand, 2014)
	•	What the policy-maker traditionally wants above all from the intelligence analyst, meteorologist, seismologist, political scientist or futurologist is the estimate of likelihood. (Omand, 2014)
	•	Intelligence seeks to illuminate the unknown. Almost by definition, intelligence analysis deals with highly ambiguous situations. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	there is no such thing as perfect intelligence — deception, lack of collection assets, cultural biases, and myriad other factors can taint the process prior to analysis ever occurring. It doesn't matter how many different groups or agencies are studying an issue — lack of a complete picture is normally caused by missing pieces of information or timeline pressures which force action after only limited information is available and not because of a lack of competitive analysis. (Stack, 1997)
	•	intelligence assessment is by its nature provisional given the inherent ambiguities in the incomplete evidence base. And those ambiguities enable policy-makers to justify taking a different view from intelligence analysts. In the words of Michael Handel, ‘Ambiguity legitimizes different interpretations, allowing politically motivated parties to select the one they prefer. The absence of clarity may also strengthen the tendency of some statesmen to become their own intelligence officers. (Omand, 2014)
	•	the intelligence is already a final output that can be used directly to improve the quality of their decisions. (Omand, 2014)
	•	As in any exercise in risk management, the implications as evaluated by government will depend as discussed in chapter 2 upon the combined effect of three different kinds of factors: likelihood, vulnerability and impact (and likelihood, exploitability and pay-off in case of oppor- tunities identified). Intelligence can illuminate all three factors, but principally likelihood. (Omand, 2014)
	•	Intelligence is a game between hiders and finders, and the former usually have the easier job. Intentions, furthermore, often exist only in a few heads and are subject to rapid change. Deception is fairly easy, and the knowledge that it is possible degrades the value of accurate information, as we will see in the Iraq case. (Jervis, 2010)
	•	intelligence is not simply facts in the form of data; it is also analysis and interpretation. (Hopple, 1984)
	•	At times, intelligence is politicized and presented to policy makers in a way that justifies their preconceptions and preferred policies. (Byman, 2005)
	•	Intelligence is concerned with providing insight into the issue under study (i.e, to reduce uncertainty). (Prunckun, 2015)
	•	Intelligence writ large needs to be defined in terms of surveillance; indeed, thetwo core conditions that distinguish surveillance are monitoring and discipline,which could be expressed as information and power.  (Treverton et al., 2006)
	•	Intelligence is a subset ofsurveillance that is normally distinguished by (a) having security as an objective; (b) covering sources, methods, and products with some secrecy; and (c) involving some resistance in that the objects of attempts to gather information and exercisepower frequently try to resist.  This definition would include counterintelligence, thus clearly indicating that action is part of intelligence. (Treverton et al., 2006)
	•	 Intelligence is theumbrella term referring to the range of activities—from targeting throughinformation collection to analysis and dissemination—conducted in secret, andaimed at maintaining or enhancing relative security by providing forewarning ofthreats or potential threats in a manner that allows for the timely implementationof a preventive policy or strategy, including, where deemed desirable, covertactivities. (Treverton et al., 2006)
	•	As individuals, we can participate in this trend simply by pursuing mastery. In our apprenticeships, we naturally begin by learning the parts and making various distinctions – the right and wrong way to proceed, the individual skills to master and their particular techniques, the various rules and conventions that govern the group. In the Creative-Active we begin to melt these distinctions as we experiment with, shape, and alter these conventions to suit out purposes. And in mastery we come full circle, returning to a sense of the whole. We intuit, and see connections, We embrace the natural complexity of life, making the brain expand to the dimensions of reality instead of shrinking it to the narrowest of specializations. This is the inevitable outcome of deep immersion in a field. We can define intelligence as moving toward thinking that is more contextual, more sensitive to the relationships between thing. (Greene, 2014)

Intelligence-gathering
	•	Intelligence-gathering, unfortunately, is rather like weather-forecasting. It cannot be the basis for going to war or declaring ‘peace in our time’ − it can only be a guide to decision-making. (Coker, 2009)
	•	Information is now critical in determining whether we go to war; but it is highly speculative because we have no absolute, objective knowledge of whether it is actually true. (Coker, 2009)
Intelligence assessment
	•	Underlying (intelligence) assessments about the international environment are factual and analytical, summarizing what is known and unknown about strategic circumstances, what is judged probable or more remote. (Frühling, 2014)
Intelligence function
	•	The intelligence function—the collection, correlation, analysis, and dissemination of relevant information—is integral to national security. (Betts, 2007)

Actionnable intelligence
	•	In the field of intelligence, one of the hottest buzzwords today is ‘‘actionable intelligence.’’ (Dahl, 2013)
	•	Although actionable intelligence appears to be something that everybody wants, there is little consensus on just what it is or how to get it. (Dahl, 2013)
	•	The term is used often by intelligence professionals and others to simply describe intelligence that is useful and desirable for decision makers. (Dahl, 2013)
	•	while definitions of the term tend to be rather general, they often include two key factors. (Dahl, 2013)
	•	The first factor is precision: a common theme in many discussions of actionable intelligence is that in order for intelligence to be useful, it must be specific.76 But precision and specificity alone are not necessarily helpful, and can be counterproductive. (Dahl, 2013)
	•	The second factor is that in order for intelligence to be actionable, it must be linked to the immediate and specific needs of the decision maker. (Dahl, 2013)
	•	scholars of intelligence have argued that the link between intelligence and decision makers is especially important in the case of actionable intelligence designed to prevent surprise attacks. (Dahl, 2013)
	•	James Wirtz, for example, describes actionable intelligence as ‘‘information of immediate and direct use to policymakers.’’ (Dahl, 2013)
	•	This book defines the first factor of preci- sion to mean intelligence that provides specific warnings in terms of targets being threatened or attacks being planned. (Dahl, 2013)
	•	This type of precise intelligence is some- times considered to be ‘‘tactical,’’ as opposed to ‘‘strategic,’’ and it is important to understand how these terms are used by intelligence professionals and scholars. (Dahl, 2013)
Strategic intelligence 
	•	tends to be longer-term, broader in focus, and of interest to senior-level policymakers who make decisions concerning the most important national and international issues. (Dahl, 2013)
	•	As a general rule, strategic intelligence warning is the kind most highly sought after by policymakers, and it is what most intelligence officials would like to provide. (Dahl, 2013)
	•	Strategic intelligence involves secrecy, so even with the ample amount of material now available for exploitation, it cannot be studied in the open according to strict standards of social science. (Betts, 2007)
	•	The four major types of strategic-level intelligence are basic, current, warning, and estimative. Basic intelligence is largely encyclopedic in nature since it involves accumulating information concerning a country's military order of battle, telecommunications, terrain, etc. (Stack, 1997)

Tactical intelligence
	•	Tactical intelligence is shorter-term, more narrowly focused (often on spe- cific events), and most likely to be used by junior-level officials engaged in planning or directing individual operations. (Dahl, 2013)
	•	many experts dismiss tactical intelligence as not useful in preventing surprise attacks or dealing with the most important, strategic-level threats. (Dahl, 2013)
	•	Tactical-level intelligence is much harder to acquire, but when available it is much more likely to be useful and actionable. (Dahl, 2013)
	•	tactical-level warning as defined in this book means specific, precise intelligence on particular threats. (Dahl, 2013)
Verbal intelligence
	•	Verbal intelligence acquires information from a written or spoken source such as an order or a plan.  It magnifies strength by giving commanders time to prepare.  So, when it emerged as a major factor with the growth ofradio in World War I, it gave armies major victories for the first time.  (Treverton et al., 2006)
	•	Verbal intelligence transformed intelligence into a significant instrument of war. (Treverton et al., 2006)
Intelligence failure
	•	Intelligence failure can lead to surprise when information is not collected or integrated effectively (Marrin, 2004) 
	•	Surprise is ever present in international relations. Many surprises are the intentional products of adversaries who successfully employ secrecy to hide their intentions. Secrecy in policy creation and implementation magnifies the application of power internationally because, when done successfully, the victim has little time to effectively counter the respective policy. (Marrin, 2004)
	•	‘‘Intelligence failure’’ often connotes a highly negative impact on U.S. national security. (Marrin, 2004)
	•	the process resembles learning with multiple feedback loops, as knowledge is constantly accumulated and refined. And at any point in time, multiple failures are occurring simultaneously within the Intelligence Community. (Marrin, 2004)
	•	yet most instances of ‘‘failure’’ do not lead to direct negative consequences for the United States, simply because most daily foreign policy decisions to not reflect the use of—or defense against—an application of power. (Marrin, 2004)
	•	identification of intelligence failures led to investigations into their causes, which led to further clarification of the tradeoffs inherent in the prevention of strategic surprise. (Marrin, 2004)
	•	Intelligence failures arising from a disconnect between the worlds of intelligence and policy—such as occurred at Barbarossa and Korea—are frequent occurrences according to the literature on intelligence failure. (Marrin, 2004)
	•	Preventing intelligence failure also requires a better understanding of the analytic process and the analytic product. (Marrin, 2004)
	•	The Revisionist School is much more optimistic and stresses that intelligence failure is a result of avoidable mistakes that lead to a preventable outcome. Hence, intelligence failures are not inevitable; they are the result of specific malfunctions that can be remedied and are not insurmountable obstacles. Therefore, analysts are not helpless and innocent victims facing an unforeseen ‘‘natural disaster. (Honig, 2007)
	•	the dependent variable—intelligence failure—seems to be, in fact, a cluster of different types of phenomena that have been mistakenly lumped together. (Honig, 2007)
	•	Only by specifying the conditions under which different mechanisms lead analysts to success or failure in their prediction can scholars adjudicate between the two schools and advance the theory of intelligence. (Honig, 2007)
	•	Intelligence can fail for many reasons, often despite the best work of intelligence professionals. (Dahl, 2013)
	•	Mark Lowenthal, a former senior CIA officer, puts the focus on intelligence agencies: ‘‘An intelligence fail- ure is the inability of one or more parts of the intelligence process—collection, evaluation and analysis, production, dissemination—to produce timely, accurate intelligence on an issue or event of importance to national interests.’ (Dahl, 2013)

	•	failures usually happen because intelligence agencies and analysts fail to understand signals and warnings that were right in front of them all the time. (Dahl, 2013)
	•	failures usually happen because intelligence agencies and analysts fail to understand signals and warnings that were right in front of them all the time. (Dahl, 2013)
	•	A classic expression of this view is Harold Wilensky’s Organizational Intelligence, in which Wilensky examines the use of intelligence and information in national security as well as business organizations. He argues that ‘‘if anything is clear from this book, it is that intelligence failures are built into complex organizations.’’ (Dahl, 2013)
	•	Wilensky, for example, writing early in the era of computers and information processing, argued that new information technologies then being developed would likely help the situation. But he noted that ‘‘intelligence failures are rooted in structural problems that cannot be fully solved.’’ (Dahl, 2013)
	•	A failure can result from a breakdown at either stage of the process. (Dahl, 2013)
	•	Intelligence failure can be conceptualized in three overlapping ways. The first is the most reassuring, the second is the most common, and the third is the most important. (Betts, 2007)
	•	Nonprofessionals usually think about intelligence only when a failure draws attention to it, but they should recognize that the intel- ligence system is a glass half full. (Betts, 2007)
	•	The most frequently noted sources of breakdowns in intelligence lie in the process of amassing timely data, communicating the data to deci- sion makers, and impressing the latter with the validity or relevance of the information. This view of the problem leaves room for optimism because it implies that procedural fixes can eliminate error. (Betts, 2007)
	•	Avoiding intelligence failure requires eliminating strategic preconceptions, but leaders cannot operate purposefully without some mental- organizing principles, which amount to preconceptions. (Betts, 2007)
	•	Intelligence can fail because the data is too permissive for policy judgment rather than too constraining. When a welter of fragmentary evidence offers support to various interpretations, ambiguity is exploited by wishfulness. (Betts, 2007)
	•	Periodically, intelligence analysts have been criticized for failing to specify odds in their predictions or for confusing their estimates of odds by using vague prose. (Betts, 2007)
	•	Some critics attribute intelligence failures to dishonest reporting or the intellectual mediocrity of analysts. (Betts, 2007) 
	•	Failures occur when ambiguity aggravates ambivalence. (Betts, 2007)
	•	Intelligence failures are not only inevitable, they are natural. (Betts, 2007)
	•	a tolerance for occasional disaster in foreign policy. (Betts, 2007)
	•	Governments have therefore equipped themselves with complex systems for horizon scanning, forecasting and prediction in order to minimize the risk of being caught by surprise. (Omand, 2014)
	•	a case where it would be reasonable to have expected that an operational alert or tactical warning should have issued when it did not. (Omand, 2014)
	•	But ‘failure’ carries the connotation of culpability, i.e. that those involved can rea- sonably be blamed for not doing better. (Omand, 2014)
	•	Intelligence failures in the wider sense will regrettably occur from time to time, such is the nature of the fragmented access and the imperfections of analytic process, resting as they do on fallible human behaviour. In most cases it would be more accurate to refer to there being an ‘intelligence gap’ to describe such cases, but intelligence gaps and flawed judgments by policy- makers go with the territory and are certainly inevitable. (Omand, 2014)
	•	As we noted earlier, there is a parallel between the world of intelligence and that of complex engineering and social systems, in which ‘normal acci- dents’ have to be expected due to the coincidence of events which, taken simply, would be regarded as unexceptionable occurrences. (Omand, 2014)
	•	Analysts and intelligence managers need to understand the condi- tions in which genuine failure becomes more likely, all along the spec- trum from negligence to irrational belief in faulty judgments, and whatcan be done to reduce the likelihood of falling into avoidable error and to describe accurately the degree of belief that should be associated with an estimate. (Omand, 2014)
	•	It is far more often the case that first impressions, partial information, and sometimes faulty assumptions underpin analytic mindsets. This weak foundation then gradually gains credence as analysts encounter more data that reinforces their mindset. In some cases, analysts will actively mold new data to make it consistent with their emerging conceptual framework─often a key reason that the warning klaxon is not sounded. When new data is consistently interpreted as “business as usual” and key assumptions are not challenged, the result, at best, is poor analysis; at worst, it becomes the explanation for why we have stumbled into another major intelligence failure. (Pherson, 2009)
	•	In many, if not most cases, the paternity of surprise is usually traced to an ‘‘intelligence failure,’’ which can take many forms: failure of access, such as the inability to penetrate a terrorist cell; the missed collection of an event or activity, such as India’s 1998 nuclear test; and from the ineffective dissemination of intelligence information, as was the case prior to the events of September 2001. (George, 2004)
	•	Failure can also be the product of flawed work by intelligence analysts, and by how intelligence information is understood and used by policymakers and military commanders. (George, 2004)
	•	The reason things often appear to go wrong when crisis looms is because the quality of the relationships involved between leaders and advisers, measured in terms of trust and mutual under- standing, and at times the personality of the decision-maker, is not enough to cope with the emotional pressures of the moment. (Omand, 2014)
	•	Some alleged failures of intelligence therefore may be put down simply to straightforwardly inadequate analysis or faulty assessment, but for the most part those are the minority. (Omand, 2014)
	•	When questionable decisions arise over the use of intelligence, and they do inevitably, then we can analyze them in terms of the problems that can occur at a combination of some or all of the following different levels: • An inability by the analysts to be able to access sufficient information that bears on the issue to allow them to reach sound judgments; incomplete and fragmentary intelligence collection is of course the norm in relation to secret intelligence, a topic that was considered in the previous chapter in terms of the continuing ‘arms race’ between offence and defence in intelligence work.• Errors by the intelligence analysts in interpreting correctly the reliability or the meaning of the intelligence that was obtained, including processing it in a sufficiently timely fashion; how analysts address their task of relating judgments to evidence, of distinguishing between evidence and belief, is the topic that was the subject of the last chapter. This part of the intelligence cycle I described in chapter 5 as elucidation, the shedding of light on hidden aspects of reality.• Difficulties in communication between the analytic and user communities, leading the former (consciously or unconsciously) to be overly influenced by the expectations of the latter, and leading the latter to fail to appreciate the proper significance attributed to the assessment by the former and thus failing to take seriously enough the analysts’ assessment; examining the pathologies in the analyst/ policy-maker relationship is the main topic for this chapter, in particular looking at what happens when intelligence judgments run counter to (or are taken as reinforcing) strongly held policy views.• Policy failure on the part of the decision-makers, again an inevitable occurrence from time to time. In particular without strategic notice of threatening developments (or of long-term opportunities) governments are flying blind. Without strategic notice it is unlikely that sufficient intelligence will be available and unlikely that policy customers will be that interested in what there is. There are many possible reasons why surprises occur. Political leaders, military commanders and policy-makers may resist early warning signs of trouble ahead, thus we are constantly surprised by technological, economic and social developments. Such absence of strategic notice is usually due to systems failure between those charged with strategy formulation, horizon scanning and strategic intelligence assessment. This problem is the subject of chapter 8. (Omand, 2014)
	•	Failure may be an orphan, but it is often a closely observed one. This is especially true for failures of intelligence, which tend to be as misunderstood as they are berated. They clearly are important. Despite the fact that most theories of international politics assume that actors see the world fairly accurately, many wars are preceded if not caused by failures to predict what others will do, and almost by definition crises involve intelligence failures. (Jervis, 2010)
	•	For members of the general public, intelligence failures are of course upset- ting because they are often linked to costly policy failures. The public often blames intelligence agencies, a propensity that policymakers are happy to encourage because it shifts the responsibility away from them. (Jervis, 2010)
	•	The most obvious sense of intelligence failure is a mismatch between the estimates and what later information reveals. This is simultaneously the most important and least interesting sense of the term. It is most important because to the extent that policy depends on accurate assessments, almost the only thing that matters is accuracy. (Jervis, 2010)
	•	In two ways the brute fact of the intelligence failure is uninteresting, however. First, it does not take much analysis to decide that there was a failure; all that is required is the observation that subsequent events did not match the assessments. Second, the fact that intelligence often is in error does not surprise scholars and should not surprise policymakers. (Jervis, 2010)
	•	The second sense of failure is a falling short of what we expect from good intelligence. Judgments here must be much more subjective, and we need to separate collection from analysis because what can be expected from the latter depends in part on what information is available. (Jervis, 2010)
	•	The second part of judging an intelligence failure is whether the analysts made good use of the information at hand. (Jervis, 2010)
	•	We like to think that bad outcomes are to be explained by bad processes and that the good use of evidence will lead to the correct conclusion, but as we will see, the prevailing reasoning often is done backwards: the fact that the answers were incorrect shows that proce- dures and ways of thinking must have been flawed. (Jervis, 2010)
	•	although we are not in a position to estimate the frequency of intelligence failures (and both the numerator and the denominator would be difficult to determine), it is clear that they are not rare events. (Jervis, 2010)
	•	Even if intelligence officers and decision makers become better social scientists, they will continue to deal with problems more difficult than those facing scholars and to do so with much less reliable information. Even if they read the information with care and know the relevant generalizations, the latter always have excep- tions. Indeed, many intelligence failures concern such exceptions, and this was true for the cases of Iran and Iraq. (Jervis, 2010)
	•	Intelligence failures typically lead to injunctions about the need to collect more data. (Hopple, 1984)
	•	The more that “intelligence failures” are accepted as such in the conventional wisdom, the more leaders will ignore their intelligence advisors. (Rover, 2005)
	•	Warning failures, including catastrophic ones, are not new for those concerned with national security. Betts (1978, 1982) has even argued that intelligence failures are natural, as well as inevitable. Pearl Harbor is perhaps the most notorious of surprises for Americans, but other notable surprise attacks include the Egyptian crossing of the Suez Canal at the onset of the Yom Kippur War in 1973, the German attack on France through the Ardennes forest in 1940, and the German invasion of Russia in 1941, all of which caught the victims flat-footed (Wohlstetter 1962; Chan 1979; Betts 1982; Stein 1982; May 1986, 2001; Levite 1987; Cohen & Gooch 1991). (Byman, 2005)
	•	Perhaps more troubling, some policy makers heard the warning but nevertheless did little to stave off disaster. (Byman, 2005)
	•	Intelligence analysts and policy makers at times do not understand all the dimen- sions of the threat they face, and this lack can cause a “failure to anticipate” (Cohen & Gooch 1991, pp. 95–131). (Byman, 2005)
	•	Ironically, fear of deception can also lead to failures, as suspicions of deception may lead intelligence agencies to discount true information (Betts 1982, p. 109). (Byman, 2005)
	•	Fear of deception also reinforces the im- portance of existing analytic biases. Contrary information may be suspected of being “disinformation” whereas confirming information may wrongly be treated as accurate. (Byman, 2005)
	•	No organization is failure-proof, and no one will ever know whether the World Trade Center and Pentagon attacks could have been prevented. (Zegart, 2005)

Major intelligence failure
	•	Major intelligence failures are usually caused by failures of analysis, not failures of collection. Relevant information is discounted, misinterpreted, ignored, rejected, or overlooked because it fails to fit a prevailing mental model or mind-set. The “signals” are lost in the “noise.” (Heuer, 1999)
Apostmortemexamination of a high-profile intelligence failure
	•	apostmortemexamination of a high-profile intelligence failure. Such investigations are carried out by Congress, the Intelligence Community staff, and CIA or DI manage- ment. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	For those outside the executive branch who do not regularly read the intelligence product, this sort of retrospective evaluation of known intelligence failures is a principal basis for judgments about the quality of intelligence analysis. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	A fundamental question posed in anypostmorteminvestigation of intelligence failure is this: Given the information that was available at thetime, should analysts have been able to foresee what was going to happen? (Heuer, 1999)
	•	These results indicate that overseers conducting postmortemevaluations of what analysts should have been able to foresee, given the available information, will tend to perceive the outcome of that situation as having been more predictable than was, in fact, the case. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	overseers will tend to be more critical of intelligence performance than is warranted. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Postmortems of intelligence failures always criticize professionals for not having rigor- ously challenged their own assumptions. (Betts, 2007)

Intelligence success
	•	intelligence successes are less well publicized than failures. (Dahl, 2013)
	•	Though intelligence agencies are not especially happy to talk about their failures, they are even less willing to disclose information about their successes, because those cases can reveal information such as intelligence sources and methods that may still be in use. (Dahl, 2013)
	•	a success requires that both steps must be satisfied. (Dahl, 2013)
Intelligence gap
	•	is the term we should use to refer to an absence of intelligence input on a topic. (Omand, 2014)
	•	There will always be intelligence gaps. (Omand, 2014)
Intelligence surprise
	•	Surprise is ever present in international relations. Many surprises are the intentional products of adversaries who successfully employ secrecy to hide their intentions. Secrecy in policy creation and implementation magnifies the application of power internationally because, when done successfully, the victim has little time to effectively counter the respective policy. (Marrin, 2004)
	•	Intelligence surprises are inevitable, but use of these techniques will ensure greater rigor in the analysis and reduce the chances of surprise. (Pherson, 2009)
	•	The surprise to me is not that there have been and will continue to be surprises, but that we are surprised that there are surprises. . . . As von Clausewitz wrote, ‘‘The unexpected is the prince of the battlefield.’’—Donald Rumsfeld, 1998. (George, 2004)
	•	In many, if not most cases, the paternity of surprise is usually traced to an ‘‘intelligence failure,’’ which can take many forms: failure of access, such as the inability to penetrate a terrorist cell; the missed collection of an event or activity, such as India’s 1998 nuclear test; and from the ineffective dissemination of intelligence information, as was the case prior to the events of September 2001. (George, 2004)

Accurate intelligence
	•	Accurate intelligence analysis obviously requires accurate perception. (Heuer, 1999)
Intelligence professional
	•	The basic responsibility of intelligence professionals is to find the truth about what goes on in the important byways of the world, and why and how it does, and to communicate that truth to policymakers, letting the chips fall where they may. (Betts, 2007)
	•	The main challenge to intelligence professionals, therefore, is to get enough information and assess its real implications dispassionately, while the main challenge to operators at the highest levels is to recognize when a proper understanding of reality confirms the feasibility of their aims, or compels them to change course. These functions are not easy to keep separate, and the difference in responsibilities between analysts and policymakers fosters different perspectives, attitudes, priorities, and behaviour. (Betts, 2007)
Intelligence analyst
	•	The intelligence analyst must make a regular assessment of the quality of sources in order to correctly weigh reports from different sources when integrating them into a whole intelligence picture, or to adjust that picture accurately whenever a new report arrives. (Honig, 2007)
	•	Intelligence analysts face difficulty in determining whether their predictions are accurate because the opportunity for validation through feedback (except long after the fact) is limited. (Honig, 2007)
	•	intelligence analysts must use models of their own and should not be blamed when they miss occasionally. (Betts, 2007)
	•	analysts typically form a picture first and then select the pieces to fit it. (Betts, 2007)
	•	Analysts, in particular, take pride in the importance and quality of their work. Briefing busy policymakers, participating in interagency policy discussions, and often working around-the-clock to provide the needed support for negotiations, crisis decisionmaking, or other vital national security activities. All this reinforces a sense of worth and value in an office’s actions and authority. (George, 2010)
	•	It is especially important that the intelligence analysts correctly read the motivations of a potential adversary in relation to the likely politi- cal goals of that regime. (Omand, 2014)
	•	An intelligence analyst might make lists of relevant variables, early warning indicators, alternative explanations, possible outcomes, factors a foreign leader will need to take into account when making a decision, or arguments for and against a given explanation or outcome. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Intelligence analysts should be self-conscious about their rea- soning processes. They should think about how they make judgments and reach conclusions, not just about the judgments and conclusions themselves. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Intelligence analysts, in seeking to make sound judgments, are always under challenge from the complexities of the issues they address and from the demands made on them for timeliness and volume of production. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	[Analysts] construct their own version of “reality” on the ba- sis of information provided by the senses, but this sensory in- put is mediated by complex mental processes that determine which information is attended to, how it is organized, and the meaning attributed to it. What people perceive, how readily they perceive it, and how they process this information after receiving it are all strongly influenced by past experience, edu- cation, cultural values, role requirements, and organizational norms, as well as by the specifics of the information received. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	In essence, Heuer sees reliance on mental models to simplify and interpret reality as an unavoidable conceptual mechanism for intelligence analysts—often useful, but at times hazardous. What is required of analysts, in his view, is a commitment to challenge, refine, and challenge again their own working mental models, precisely because these steps are central to sound interpretation of complex and ambiguous issues. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Intelligence analysts must understand themselves before they can under- stand others. Training is needed to (a) increase self-awareness concerning generic problems in how people perceive and make analytical judgments concerning foreign events, and (b) provide guidance and practice in over- coming these problems. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Training of intelligence analysts generally means instruction in organizational procedures, methodological techniques, or substantive topics. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Intelligence analysts often work in small groups and always within the context of a large, bureaucratic organization. Problems are inherent in the processes that occur at all three levels—individual, small group, and organization. This book focuses on problems inherent in analysts’ mental processes, inasmuch as these are probably the most insidious. Analysts can observe and get a feel for these problems in small-group and organizational processes, but it is very difficult, at best, to be self-conscious about the workings of one’s own mind. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	what people in general and analysts in particular perceive, and how readily they perceive it, are strongly influenced by their past experience, education, cultural values, and role requirements, as well as by the stimuli recorded by their receptor organs. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Many experiments have been conducted to show the extraordinary extent to which the information obtained by an observer depends upon the observer’s own assumptions and preconceptions. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Analysts do not achieve objective analysis by avoiding preconceptions; that would be ignorance or self-delusion. Objectivity is achieved by making basic assumptions and reasoning as explicit as possible so that they can be challenged by others and analysts can, themselves, examine their validity. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Analysts might seek to limit the adverse impact of this tendency by suspending judgment for as long as possible as new information is being received. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	the intelligence analyst’s own preconceptions are likely to exert a greater impact on the analytical product than in other fields where an analyst is working with less ambiguous and less discordant information. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	the intelligence analyst is among the first to look at new problems at an early stage when the evidence is very fuzzy indeed. The analyst then follows a problem as additional increments of evidence are received and the picture gradually clarifies—as happened with test sub- jects in the experiment demonstrating that initial exposure to blurred stimuli interferes with accurate perception even after more and better information becomes available. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	an analyst who starts observing a potential problem situation at an early and unclear stage is at a disadvantage as compared with others, such as policymakers, whose first exposure may come at a later stage when more and better information is available. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	That intelligence analysts perform as well as they do is testimony to their generally sound judgment, training, and dedication in performing a dauntingly difficult task. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	An analyst’s memory provides continuous input into the analytical process. This input is of two types—additional factual information on historical background and context, and schemata the analyst uses to determine the meaning of newly acquired information. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Analysts often receive new information that should, logically, cause them to reevaluate the credibility or significance of previous information. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	There is, however, a crucial difference between the chess master and the master intelligence analyst. Although the chess master faces a dif- ferent opponent in each match, the environment in which each contest takes place remains stable and unchanging: the permissible moves of the diverse pieces are rigidly determined, and the rules cannot be changed without the master’s knowledge. Once the chess master develops an ac- curate schema, there is no need to change it. The intelligence analyst, however, must cope with a rapidly changing world. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	The intelligence analyst works in a somewhat unique informational environment. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	The analyst has only limited control over the stream of information. Tasking of sources to report on specific subjects is often a cumbersome and time-consuming process. Evidence on some important topics is sporadic or nonexistent. Most human-source information is second hand at best. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Recognizing and avoiding biases under such circumstances is particularly difficult. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Intelligence analysts generally work with secondhand information. The information that analysts receive is mediated by the written words of others rather than perceived directly with their own eyes and ears. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Personal observations by intelligence analysts and agents can be as deceptive as secondhand accounts. Most individuals visiting foreign countries become familiar with only a small sample of people representing a narrow segment of the total society. Incomplete and distorted perceptions are a common result. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	It seems likely that intelligence analysts, too, assign insufficient weight to statistical information. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Analysts should give little weight to anecdotes and personal case histories unless they are known to be typical, and perhaps no weight at all if aggregate data based on a more valid sample can be obtained. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	A principal characteristic of intelligence analysis is that key information is often lacking. Analytical problems are selected on the basis of their importance and the perceived needs of the consumers, without much regard for availability of information. Analysts have to do the best they can with what they have, somehow taking into account the fact that much relevant information is known to be missing. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	intelligence analysts should be able to recognize what relevant evidence is lacking and factor this into their calculations. They should also be able to estimate the potential impact of the missing data and to adjust confidence in their judgment accordingly. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Missing data is normal in intelligence problems, but it is probably more difficult to recognize that important information is absent and to incorporate this fact into judgments on intelligence ques- tions than in the more concrete “car won’t start” experiment. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	analysts should identify explicitly those relevant variables on which information is lacking, consider alterna- tive hypotheses concerning the status of these variables, and then modify their judgment and especially confidence in their judgment accordingly. 
	•	They should also consider whether the absence of information is normal or is itself an indicator of unusual activity or inactivity. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	When working with a small but consistent body of evidence, analysts need to consider how representative that evidence is of the total body of poten tially available information. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	The intelligence analyst employing the historical mode of analysis is essentially a storyteller. He or she constructs a plot from the previous events, and this plot then dictates the possible endings of the incomplete story. The plot is formed of the “dominant concepts or leading ideas” that the analyst uses to postulate patterns of relationships among the available data. The analyst is not, of course, preparing a work of fiction. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	There are constraints on the analyst’s imagination, but imagination is nonetheless involved because there is an almost unlimited variety of ways in which the available data might be organized to tell a meaningful story. The constraints are the available evidence and the principle of coherence. The story must form a logical and coherent whole and be internally consis- tent as well as consistent with the available evidence. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Recognizing that the historical or narrative mode of analysis involves telling a coherent story helps explain the many disagreements among analysts, inasmuch as coherence is a subjective concept. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	It assumes some prior beliefs or mental model about what goes with what. More relevant to this discussion, the use of coherence rather than scientific observation as the criterion for judging truth leads to biases that presumably influence all analysts to some degree. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Analysts overestimate the extent to which other countries are pursuing coherent, rational, goal-maximizing policies, because this makes for more coherent, logical, rational explanations. This bias also leads analysts and policymakers alike to overestimate the predictability of future events in other countries. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Analysts know that outcomes are often caused by accident, blunder, coincidence, the unintended consequence of well-intentioned policy, improperly executed orders, bargaining among semi-independent bureaucratic entities, or following standard operating procedures under inappropriate circumstances. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Intelligence analysts are more exposed than most people to hard evidence of real plots, coups, and conspiracies in the international arena. Despite this—or perhaps because of it—most intelligence analysts are not especially prone to what are generally regarded as conspiracy theories. Although analysts may not exhibit this bias in such extreme form, the bias presumably does influence analytical judgments in myriad little ways. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Intelligence analysts are familiar with the problem of weighing in- ternal versus external causes of behavior in a number of contexts. When a new leader assumes control of a foreign government, analysts assess the likely impact of changed leadership on government policy. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	analysts should have a general understanding of what it takes to know whether a relationship exists. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Analysts remember occurrences that support the relationship they are examining better than those that do not. To the extent that perception is influenced by expectations, analysts may have missed or discounted the contrary instances. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Intelligence analysts may be less influenced than others by the availability bias. Analysts are evaluating all available information, not making quick and easy inferences. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Intelligence analysts sometimes present judgments in the form of a scenario—a series of events leading to an anticipated outcome. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Intelligence analysts have to be capable of ‘critical thinking’, a requirement that is made salient by intelligence failures. (Hoffman et al., 2011)
	•	Heuer claimed that intelligence analysts, especially the less experienced ones, are subject to a number of biases, including salience bias, confirmation, anchoring bias hindsight bias and availability bias. (Hoffman et al., 2011)
	•	Time pressures increase the likelihood that an analyst will fall back on an initial hypothesis and not realize that he or she is headed down the wrong path until it is too late. Usually the more important or politically significant an issue becomes, the greater the pressure to generate a finished product. (Pherson, 2009)
	•	Intelligence analysts protect Homeland Security from terrorist attacks by providing decisionmakers with information acquired overseas that allows them to prevent, deter, disrupt, or destroy the terrorist threat. (Marrin, 2002)
	•	An analyst could easily spend all day doing nothing but reading intelligence and not actually producing anything. But being an analyst, by definition, requires an effort to make sense of the pieces of the terrorist puzzle and provide value-added analysis. (Marrin, 2002)
	•	Analysts tend to have a two-step analytic approach. They use intuitive “pattern and trend analysis” – consisting of the identification of repeated behavior over time and increases or decreases in that behavior – to uncover changes in some aspect of international behavior that could have national security implications.39 Once patterns are detected, they rely on ad hoc rules derived from study in relevant theory – for example, economics, political science, or psychology – to determine the significance of the pattern. (Marrin, 2002)
	•	The daily routine of an intelligence analyst is to track incoming information, look for changes that would be relevant for a policymaker, and continue researching for ongoing intelligence reports or other longer-term projects. (Marrin, 2002)
	•	When an incident occurs that meets the threshold of current intelligence, the analyst has only a couple of hours to do background research, come to a conclusion regarding the implications of the incident for American interests, and convert this information and analysis into acceptable language for publication. (Marrin, 2002)
	•	Analysts are also taught to focus on the “what” and the “so what,” or the facts and their implications, including for American policy. (Marrin, 2002)
	•	In addition, analysts are taught to present conclusions first with supporting data after so that a busy reader will grasp the importance of the event without much effort diving into the details. The end product is an intelligence report that is clear and to the point, but lacking color or personality. (Marrin, 2002)
	•	Ultimately, however, strategists, no less than intelligence analysts, must develop a sharp appreciation for what intelligence can and cannot be expected to provide. They must also rely on their own intellectual abilities and expertise when reaching momentous decisions of war and peace. The success of their policies often depends on how well strategists—not just intelligence analysts—accurately assess, understand, and exploit the international environment in which they are operating. (George, 2004)
	•	Analysts naturally favor information that fits their well-formed mental models, and often dismiss other information that might support an alternative hypothesis. Or, they minimize the importance of intelligence gaps and foreign deception and denial efforts, believing U.S. intelligence systems are spoof-proof or American analysts too clever to be outwitted by third-class intelligence services. Even more invidious, the more expert one becomes, the more likely one is to discount the possibility of surprise. (George, 2004)
	•	Analysts must perform their functions with objectivity and with awareness of their own assumptions and reasoning. They must employ reasoning techniques and practical mechanisms that reveal and mitigate bias. (DNI, 2007)
	•	Analysts should be alert to influence by existing analytic positions or judgments and must consider alternative perspectives and contrary information. (DNI, 2007)
	•	Analysis should not be unduly constrained by previous judgments when new developments indicate a modification is necessary. (DNI, 2007)
	•	Intelligence analysts already engage in something approaching sense-making: for instance, in the more thoughtful aspects of the current intelligence process. These involve ongoing efforts to update the story line on an issue, usually without recourse to formal analytic techniques. (Fishbein and Treverton, 2004)
	•	Intelligence analysts need to focus on patterns that are different, even contradictory to those they expect, to lessen the degree to which their mental models inhibit their ability to perceive new information. And they must do so fairly regularly to promote continuous awareness of possibilities. (Fishbein and Treverton, 2004)
	•	The first hurdle for analysts is identifying the relevant and diagnostic information from the increasing volume of ambiguous and contradictory data that is acquired through open source and clandestine means. (US Government, 2009)
	•	Analysts must also pierce the shroud of secrecy—and sometimes deception—that state and nonstate actors use to mislead. (US Government, 2009)
	•	Intelligence analysts should be self-conscious about their reasoning process. They should think about how they make judgments and reach conclusions, not just about the judgments and conclusions themselves. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Judgment is what analysts use to fill gaps in their knowledge. It entails going beyond the available information and is the principal means of coping with uncertainty. It always involves an analytical leap, from the known into the uncertain. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	the analyst is commonly working with incomplete, ambiguous, and often contradictory data. The intelligence analyst’s function might be described as transcending the limits of incomplete information through the exercise of analytical judgment. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Intelligence analysts tend to be good historians, with a large number of historical precedents available for recall. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	The intelligence analyst has another tempting option not available to the policymaker: to avoid judgment by simply describing the current situation, identifying alternatives, and letting the intelligence consumer make the judgment about which alternative is most likely. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Analysts, like people in general, tend to see what they are looking for and to overlook that which is not specifically included in their search strategy. They tend to limit the processed information to that which is relevant to the current hypothesis. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	The evidence available to the intelligence analyst is in one impor- tant sense different from the evidence available to test subjects asked to infer the number sequence rule. The intelligence analyst commonly deals with problems in which the evidence has only a probabilistic relation- ship to the hypotheses being considered. Thus it is seldom possible to eliminate any hypothesis entirely, because the most one can say is that a given hypothesis is unlikely given the nature of the evidence, not that it is impossible. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	the current intelligence analyst’s task is often extremely concept-driven. The analyst must provide immediate interpretation of the latest, often unexpected events. Apart from his or her store of background information, the analyst may have no data other than the initial, usually incomplete report. Under these circumstances, interpretation is based upon an implicit mental model of how and why events normally transpire in the country for which the analyst is responsible. Accuracy of judgment depends almost exclusively upon accuracy of the mental model, for there is little other basis for judg- ment. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	intelligence analysts get little systematic feedback, and even when they learn that an event they had foreseen has actually occurred or failed to occur, they typically do not know for certain whether this happened for the reasons they had foreseen. Thus, an analyst’s personal experience may be a poor guide to revision of his or her mental mode. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Analysts commonly find pieces that ap- pear to fit many different pictures. Instead of a picture emerging from putting all the pieces together, analysts typically form a picture first and then select the pieces to fit. Accurate estimates depend at least as much upon the mental model used in forming the picture as upon the number of pieces of the puzzle that have been collected. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Analysts should try to identify alter- native models, conceptual frameworks, or interpretations of the data by seeking out individuals who disagree with them rather than those who agree. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Intelligence analysts, too, are expected to raise new questions that lead to the identification of previously unrecognized relationships or to possible outcomes that had not previously been foreseen. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Intelligence analysts must generate ideas concerning potential causes or explanations of events, policies that might be pursued or actions taken by a foreign government, possible outcomes of an existing situation, and variables that will influence which outcome actually comes to pass. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Intelligence analysts have often spent less time living in and absorbing the culture of the countries they are working on than outside experts on those countries. If analysts fail to understand the foreign culture, they will not see issues as the foreign government sees them. Instead, they may be inclined to mirror-image—that is, to assume that the other country’s leaders think like we do. The analyst assumes that the other country will do what we would do if we were in their shoes. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Kent argued that intelligence analysts must not get too close to policymakers because the result would be skewed intelligence analysis. (Stack, 1997)
	•	If the Intelligence Community is to help policymakers make the best-informed decisions possible. then analysts must bring something to the party in short, they need to be seen as credible sources of needed expertise. (Petersen, 2003)
	•	Analysts tended to have "more time to think." And they also "approached issues differently" because of their country expertise and, equally important, their special knowledge of economic and military affairs. (Davis, 1995)
	•	Analysts Should Analyze. (Davis, 1995)
	•	What did I want from analysts? I want their reading of what is going on in the domestic affairs of country X or Y countries the President is planning to visit to advance foreign policy or countries from which we are going to receive important visitors to discuss problems and bilateral strategy, or countries on which, for one reason or another, we feel a need to get US policy into better shape.  (Davis, 1995)
	•	intelligence analysts should help key policymakers make the best game plan by telling them what they do not know or appreciate sufficiently. (Davis, 1995)
	•	Analysts and their analysis are deemed most useful when they: Clarify what is known by laying out the evidence and pointing to cause-and effect patterns. Carefully structure assumptions and argumentation about what is unknown and unknowable. Bring expertise to bear for planing and action on important long shot threats and opportunities. (Davis, 1996)
	•	In Ambassador Wolfowitz's view, intelligence  analysts dealt with what could  not be known about Moscow's strategic intentions by  promoting a single interpretation that  consciously or unconsciously applied applied  the biases of US policymakers with  a political interest in understating the Soviet threat. (Davis, 1996)
	•	On this and like subjects, Ambassador Wolfowitz believed that US intelligence analysts and decisionmakers faced critical and compound uncertainties requiring carefully structured argumentation of various plausible alternatives. Instead, intelligence analysts submerged the uncertainty into carefully crafted compromise language that supported current US policy. (Davis, 1996)
	•	Analysts should not usurp the decision role of policymakers by prematurely limiting the options on the table. (Davis, 1996)
	•	Analysts must always remember that their job is to inform the policymaker’s decision, not to try to supplant it, regardless of how strongly they feel about the issue. (Davis, 1996)
	•	Those who reach key positions tend to be confident in their judgments, and are not prone to nervous introspection. Analysts are recruited more in an academic or professional mould and will tend to distrust formal power structures that they would regard as ‘playing politics’. They are likely to be more comfortable with the concept of debate and criticism—especially giving it—than taking instructions. They are likely to have questioning personalities. (Omand, 2014)
	•	Intelligence analysts, as a generality, are used to looking at other people’s systems, their economies, armies and secret services as they find them. They are enjoined to avoid commenting on policy, and therefore on the actions of their own government. (Omand, 2014)
	•	Intelligence analysts have long made the distinction between capabilities and intentions when assessing the likelihood of aggressive steps being taken by a potential adversary (whether for example military action, the nationalization of assets, state-sponsored terrorism or WMD development). Capabilities take time to build up and can be monitored objectively and are thus in the nature of secrets to be uncovered; intentions can change overnight and are in the nature of mysteries to be divined.  (Omand, 2014)
	•	Intelligence analysts have therefore to be brought up to shun vague terms, of the type that slip out when we are not sure but do not want to admit it, such as ‘more or less’, or ‘apparently’, or that standby ‘on the one hand/on the other hand’. (Omand, 2014)
	•	the principal calling for intelligence analysts at any one time is to try to tell it like it is, to remain a unique calling within a policymaking process overburdened with prior commitments, emotion, special pleading, and hubris. (Ford, 1997)
	•	Yet analysts have to keep in mind that hubris is not a monopoly of policymakers. (Ford, 1997)
	•	In dealing with policymakers, we also need to keep in mind our role as intelligence analysts. Managers and analysts alike should meet with policymakers on a regular basis to exchange views and explore new ideas. In today's changing world, however, we must guard against taking on tasks that do not deal with intelligence topics and may be intended instead to drive a specific policy agenda. Managers and analysts need to discuss such situations candidly and products that address only the intelligence issues at hand. (Gates, 1992)
	•	analysts must be able to construct clearly a logical analysis of an issue. This includes not only the ability to write a clear argument, but also an ability to examine one's own biases, assumptions, and limitations. (Gates, 1992)
	•	every analyst must approach editing, coordination, and review as a process to improve a piece. An analyst must see the process as a team effort, with coordinating analysts and managers as team members who will offer input that must be considered and dealt with. No analyst should think that his or her view of the world is the only correct view, or that the opinions and arguments of others are not worthy of consideration. We must always keep our minds open. (Gates, 1992)
	•	An analyst should not expect his or her analysis to go unchallenged, and he or she should not be willing to accept the analysis of others without challenge. By questioning managers and other analysts on the reasons underlying their comments and judgments, especially those in conflict with our own, we learn to look at issues in new ways - sometimes ways that are better. You should rightly question anyone who cannot defend or explain the reasons behind disagreements with you analysis. (Gates, 1992)
	•	Also, unwarranted concerns about politicization can arise when analysts themselves fail to understand their role in the process. We do produce a corporate product. If the policymaker wants the opinion of a single individual, he or she can (and frequently does) consult any one of a dozen outside experts on any given issue. Your work, on the other hand, counts because it represents the well-considered view of an entire directorate and, in the case of of National Estimates, the entire Intelligence Community. Analysts themselves must play a critical role in making the system work. They must do their part to help foster an open environment. Analysts must understand and practice the corporate concept. They must discard the academic mindset that says their work is their own, and they must take into account the views of others during the coordination process. (Gates, 1992)
	•	In the end, preventing distortion of our analysis depends on where all of us draw the line day in and day out. We must draw a line:• Between producing a corporate product and supressing different views.• Between adjusting stylistic presentation to anticipate your consumer's predilections and changing the analysis to pander to them.• Between making order out of chaos and suppressing legitimate debate.• Between viewing reporting critically and using evidence selectively.• Between avoiding wishy-washiness and pretending to be more certain than we are.• Between being a team player and being a careerist• Between maintaining efficiency and and suppressing legitimate debate.• Between providing leadership and fostering a fearful, oppressive climate. (Gates, 1992)
	•	Analysts tend toward pessimism, if only because the risk to their reputations is greater for failing to predict a negative development than from issuing a warning that turns out to be fortunately wrong. (Betts, 2007)
	•	The analyst’s imperative is intellectual: to produce a paper that con- veys the truth. To do this without arguing beyond what the evidence supports means producing a paper that faithfully reflects reality in all its complexity and ambiguity, does not distort the facts by oversim- plifying them, and clarifies the range of possible futures left open by circumstances. (Betts, 2007)
	•	A careful analyst will be more like Hamlet; an effective operator, more like Patton. (Betts, 2007)
	•	Taxpayers hire intelligence analysts not to produce truth for its own sake but to produce useful truth. If analysts or manag- ers compromise quality in order to improve receptivity, however, they also vitiate the purpose, since informed judgment depends on accurate knowledge. Analysts worry most about truth; operators worry most about utility. But neither truth nor utility matters unless they are joined. (Betts, 2007)
	•	As Arthur Hulnick’s surveys have indicated, “Policymakers value research work . . . on the basis of brevity, timeliness and relevance in that order. Intelligence producers tend to reverse those priorities.” (Betts, 2007)
	•	Intelligence analysts "would rather use words than numbers to describe how confident we are in our analysis," a senior CIA officer who's served for more than 20 years told me. Moreover, "most consumers of intelligence aren't particularly sophisticated when it comes to probabilistic analysis. They like words and pictures, too. My experience is that [they] prefer briefings that don't center on numerical calculation. That's not to say we can't do it, but there's really not that much demand for it." (Schrage, 2005)
	•	The committees assume that the reality the Intelligence analysts are trying to predict is determinate, and that they are using probabilities in their predictions only because of the lack of knowledge or the imperfect ability of humans to reach the right conclusions from the data in hand. If only all the necessary data had been available to the analysts, and if only analysts were not prone to err, it would be possible to predict with certainty the future regional or global events. (Rosenberg, 2008)
	•	the only possible way to determine a certain future probability is by using the analyst’s intuition. (Rosenberg, 2008)
	•	intelligence analysts cannot often support their judgments with statistical analysis of empirical data derived from a large number of similar past cases. (Weiss, 2008)
	•	Like intelligence analysts, scientific advisors to policymakers have long prided themselves on ‘‘speaking truth to power.’’ In practice, matters are more complicated. In science advising as in intelligence analysis, ‘‘truth’’ may be probabilistic, and may depend on an advisor’s best educated guess as to the outcome of experiments that have not yet been performed or the interpretation of data that are not quite in point. Like intelligence professionals, scientific advisors must adjust to the needs of their advisees, who bear ultimate responsibility for their decisions. (Weiss, 2008)
	•	Environmentalists, somewhat like intelligence analysts, sometimes face disinformation put out to the public, in this case by opponents of one or another regulation. Scientists detect such disinformation rather easily, but often have difficulty refuting them convincingly before a general audience. The resulting frustration resembles that felt by intelligence analysts—or their policymaker clients— when they cannot refute misinformation in the press. (Weiss, 2008)
	•	Unfortunately, except in certain long lasting and slowly changing strategic situations, frequentist statistics are typically unavailable to intelligence analysts—or if they are available, must be based on a very small sample of past events. Analysts are therefore forced to use subjective estimates of probability if they wish to communicate the level of uncertainty they associate with their interpretations and judgments. (Weiss, 2008)
	•	Like experts in many other fields, intelligence analysts tend to be overconfident regarding the accuracy of their judgments at high levels of probability and under-confident at low levels. Professor Steven Rieber recommends systematic ‘‘calibration feedback’’ to improve the accuracy of analysts’ estimates of the probability they assign to intelligence judgments.31 This approach would also facilitate feedback to the analysts regarding their level of confidence in their own judgment. (Weiss, 2008)
	•	Intelligence analysts are not the only expert advisers who have resisted pressure to give their clients a clear statement of the uncertainty they associate with their professional opinions. Scientific advisers, environmental activists, lawyers, and any number of other professions avoid making explicit estimates of this uncertainty, in each case using well-established stratagems and offering elaborate rationalizations for ignoring available tools until they are forced to use them by outside pressures. (Weiss, 2008)
	•	The assessment of models is a problem that environmentalists share with intelligence analysts. (Weiss, 2008) 
	•	Intelligence analysts can and should use decision-support techniques to provide timely support to managers, commanders, planners, and decision makers who do make these choices. (Heuer and Pherson, 2011)
	•	Even if intelligence officers and decision makers become better social scientists, they will continue to deal with problems more difficult than those facing scholars and to do so with much less reliable information. (Jervis, 2010)
	•	Typically, intelligence analysts reflect the political premises and biases of decision makers-either because they have no choice (dissent from official preconceptions would be ridiculed or punished) or they share central beliefs with the policy community. (Hopple, 1984)
	•	Analysts and policy makers must transform fragmented and weak data into a coherent vision of the future—a task that challenges even the best minds. Their imaginations must leap, discerning a future threat where none existed in the past. (Byman, 2005)
	•	Analysts’ and policy makers’ biases and preconceptions shape how information is received and analyzed. (Byman, 2005)
	•	Like intelligence analysts, policy makers have biases and see only part of the overall picture. This limited view leads to many mistakes. (Byman, 2005)
	•	Analysts conduct intelligence analysis to produce timely, accurate, relevant, and predictive intelligence for dissemination to the commander and staff. The purpose of intelligence analysis is to describe past, current, and attempt to predict future threat capabilities, activities, and tactics; terrain and weather conditions; and civil considerations. (Army Publishing Directorate, 2020)

Analyst’s imperative
	•	The analyst’s imperative is intellectual: to produce a paper that con- veys the truth. To do this without arguing beyond what the evidence supports means producing a paper that faithfully reflects reality in all its complexity and ambiguity, does not distort the facts by oversimplifying them, and clarifies the range of possible futures left open by circumstances. (Betts, 2007)

Senior intelligence analyst
	•	senior intelligence officials must make challenging assumptions and considering alternative possibilities a high, indeed critical, priority. (Fishbein and Treverton, 2004)
	•	Managers; particularly those who are teaching our less experienced analysts how to do basic intelligence analysis, cannot afford poor communications. Managers should be showing analysts the hows and why's behind their decisions, not just telling them to change words. If you can't tell an analyst why you don't believe his or her arguments, or if you can't offer a logical counterargument, then you should take more time to construct you. (Gates, 1992)
	•	Managers must create an environment in which analysts feel comfortable airing substantive differences. Managers must listen; they must talk; they must erode some of the hierarchy. And they must create a sense of joint ownership of ideas. Managers need to create an atmosphere in which people can approach them without fear of retribution. Managers must—I repeat must—create a barrier-free environment for ideas. (Gates, 1992)
	•	it is the managers who bear the greater burden of responsibility in the review process, and they need to have a sound basis for their actions. (Gates, 1992)
	•	If intelligence managers bear primary responsibility for making their products useful or even used, however, their vulnerability to charges of politicization increases. (Betts, 2007)
	•	Should norms about choice of intelligence leadership bear much of the weight of these problems, it would be desirable for the top intelligence manager to be from the opposition party, or to be a nonpolitical career professional from the military or intelligence community itself. (Betts, 2007)

Military analyst
	•	the justification of a mission (in this case, readiness for future contingencies rather than demonstrating current success on the battlefield) prompts pessimistic estimates by military analysts. (Betts, 2007)
Autonomous analyst
	•	autonomous analysts without budgetary axes to grind, but with biases similar to those in the intellectual community, tend toward more relaxed predictions. (Betts, 2007)
	•	autonomous analysts are more disinterested and usually more objective, but they lack on-the-scene knowledge and, especially, influence. (Betts, 2007)

Successful analysts
	•	Moore and Krizan (2005; see also Thompson et al. 1984) provided a deep hierarchy of the requirements, categorised at the highest level into knowledge, abilities, characteristics and skills, for example: successful analysts possess huge amounts of knowledge, and are voracious learners, successful analysts are highly motivated and have insatiable curiosity, successful analysts are good collaborators and team members, successful analysts ‘know the ropes’ of their own and other intelligence organisations (policies, procedures, and mission structures); successful analysts are good at reasoning (i.e. critical thinking), successful analysts organise their knowledge around conceptual models, and can reason top-down and abductively, successful analysts do not have access to more or better information than the less able analyst, but are better able to chunk the available items of information into significant patterns, successful analysts see their work as a form of research, having strategies and designs, and reliant on information exploration and the evaluative measurement of process and product. (Hoffman et al., 2011)
Careful analyst
	•	A careful analyst will be more like Hamlet; an effective operator, more like Patton. (Betts, 2007)

Warning analyst
	•	Often it falls to the warning analyst to provide the necessary counterweight to the chronic pressures to fit new events into existing frameworks and to make analytic judgments quickly. It is his or her job to help analysts recognize their cognitive pitfalls and provide timely warning of unanticipated events. (Pherson, 2009)
	•	Warning analysts can reduce the chances of main-line analysts and policymakers being surprised by future events if they employ structured analytic techniques. (Pherson, 2009)
	•	Analysts who look for evidence that proves they are right often do not see─or try to discredit─the evidence that suggests they may be wrong. Starting analysis by generating multiple hypotheses, or potential explanations, rather than a single hypothesis can help the warning analyst avoid both cognitive pitfalls. (Pherson, 2009)
	•	Use of these techniques helps warning analysts anticipate what might occur in the future and better prepare themselves to track developments that presage dramatic change. In the end, decisionmakers will benefit from the more thoughtful, comprehensive analysis that results from employing these techniques. (Pherson, 2009)
CIA analyst
	•	CIA’s qualifications for new counterterrorism analysts include a master’s degree or PhD in foreign area studies, international affairs, or national security; excellent analytical, written, and oral communication skills; strong interpersonal skills and the ability to work under tight deadlines; a minimum 3.2 GPA; and preferably foreign language proficiency and foreign area knowledge through study, travel, or work abroad.”27 In addition, once hired “analysts are encouraged to maintain and broaden their professional ties through academic study, contacts, and attendance at professional meetings.” (Marrin, 2002)
	•	A CIA analyst’s area of responsibility and expertise is defined by his or her account. Each analyst has a specialty – also known as “discipline” or “occupation” – most frequently in political, military, economic, or leadership analysis. (Marrin, 2002)
	•	The work process for the typical CIA analyst is to continuously monitor his or her account for incoming information. Keeping up with the workload is a continuing challenge, and many analysts can be found in their cubicles reading or writing, sometimes even on weekends. The bulk of an intelligence analyst’s source material comes from a variety of information systems available at his or her desk. (Marrin, 2002)
	•	CIA analysts use a “DI Writing Style” designed to emphasize precision and clarity while removing idiosyncratic phrases and the personality of the writer so that it becomes a “corporate” product. (Marrin, 2002)
DI analysts
	•	Most DI analysts are organized into multidisciplinary teams and work in one of three regional offices. (Marrin, 2002)
All-source analysts
	•	All-source analysts require “years of rigorous education and on-the-job experience” to be effective, according to senior IC officers. (Marrin, 2002)
Analyst’s account
	•	An analyst’s account is the combination of geographic area of responsibility and discipline, for example “Iraqi leadership analyst” or “Russian political analyst.” Depending on the importance of the country and the number of analysts, some teams are further divided into smaller categories and as a result a Russian political analyst could be assigned to assess only Russia’s foreign policies towards Asia. (Marrin, 2002)
	•	While there is some overlap of accounts, it is possible for intelligence data to be overlooked if the responsible analyst is out of the office or otherwise occupied. (Marrin, 2002)
Intelligence analysis
	•	In addition, longtime CIA officer Richards Heuer noted: ‘‘Intelligence analysis is ... a cognitive process. If we are to [improve] ... analysis, we must somehow penetrate and affect the mental processes of the individuals who do the analysis.’’ He suggested ways to ‘‘(improve) the mental models employed by the analyst to interpret his data.’ (Marrin, 2004)
	•	scholars and practitioners alike must recognize that intelligence is not a form of science—neither in its ability to predict (as Revisionists claim), nor in its required standards of evidence (as Orthodox scholars expect). It follows that intelligence analysts must admit their own limitations in order to perform successfully. (Honig, 2007)
	•	According to the logic of estimative redundancy, more analysis is better than less. (Betts, 2007)
	•	The traditional intelligence model is incremental. It focuses on patiently tracking developments step by step, for example by compari- son over time of series of reconnaissance images. (Omand, 2014)
	•	The finer the detail that the intelligence analyst tries to bring to bear, the more interrelationships are discovered that have to be taken into account. (Omand, 2014)
	•	What is needed in forecast- ing is the capacity of the analyst to visualize a set of circumstances, causes and consequences that have not (yet) occurred in reality (and if wisely anticipated, may never occur). (Omand, 2014)
	•	The limited capacity of working memory is the source of many problems in doing intelligence analysis. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Intelligence analysis is fundamentally a men- tal process, but understanding this process is hindered by the lack of conscious awareness of the workings of our own minds. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	the circumstances under which intelligence analysis is conducted are precisely the circumstances in which accurate perception tends to be most difficult. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	One of the more difficult mental feats is to take a familiar body of data and reorganize it visually or mentally to perceive it from a different perspective. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	In order to understand international interactions, analysts must understand the situation as it appears to each of the opposing forces, and constantly shift back and forth from one perspective to the other as they try to fathom how each side interprets an ongoing series of interactions. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Comprehending the nature of perception has significant implica- tions for understanding the nature and limitations of intelligence analysis. The circumstances under which accurate perception is most difficult are exactly the circumstances under which intelligence analysis is generally conducted—dealing with highly ambiguous situations on the basis of information that is processed incrementally under pressure for early judgment. This is a recipe for inaccurate perception. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	The receipt of information in small increments over time also facilitates assimilation of this information into the analyst’s existing views. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Similar research with medical doctors diagnosing illness indicates that differences between stronger and weaker performers are to be found in the organization of information and experience in long-term memory. The same presumably holds true for intelligence analysts. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Factors that influence how information is stored in memory and that affect future retrievability include: being the first-stored information on a given topic, the amount of attention focused on the information, the credibility of the information, and the importance attributed to the information at the moment of storage. By influencing the content of memory, all of these factors also influence the outcome of intelligence analysis. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	availability in memory influences judgments of probability. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Conflicting information of uncertain reliability is endemic to intelligence analysis, as is the need to make rapid judgments on current events even before all the evidence is in. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	A principal characteristic of intelligence analysis is that key information is often lacking. Analytical problems are selected on the basis of their importance and the perceived needs of the consumers, without much regard for availability of information. Analysts have to do the best they can with what they have, somehow taking into account the fact that much relevant information is known to be missing. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Collection of data on many comparable cases to test hypotheses about cause and effect is not feasible for most questions of interest to the Intelligence Community, especially questions of broad political or strategic import relating to another country’s intentions. To be sure, it is feasible more often than it is done, and increased use of scientific proce- dures in political, economic, and strategic research is much to be encour- aged. But the fact remains that the dominant approach to intelligence analysis is necessarily quite different. It is the approach of the historian rather than the scientist, and this approach presents obstacles to accurate inferences about causality. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Much intelligence analysis is based on common-sense assumptions about how people and governments normally behave. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	In assessing a situation, an analyst sometimes has two kinds of evi- dence available—specific evidence about the individual case at hand, and numerical data that summarize information about many similar cases. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Evaluations of intelligence analysis—analysts’ own evaluations of their judgments as well as others’ evaluations of intelligence products—are distorted by systematic biases. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Hindsight biases influence the evaluation of intelligence reporting in three ways: Analysts normally overestimate the accuracy of their past judgments; Intelligence consumers normally underestimate how much they learned from intelligence reports.; Overseers of intelligence production who conduct postmortem analyses of an intelligence failure normally judge that events were more readily foreseeable than was in fact the case. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	The domains of human affairs that are subject to analysis and the work of analysis are ‘moving targets’, constantly changing in demands, focus and goal. (Hoffman et al., 2011)
	•	In the years since 9/11, intelligence analysis has become ‘grappling with mysteries’ rather than the ‘discovery of secrets’ (Swenson et al. 2005). (Hoffman et al., 2011)
	•	There is a consensus that intelligence analysis is difficult because predicting is difficult. (Hoffman et al., 2011)
	•	In the complex, evolving, and uncertain situations that intelligence analysts and policymakers must deal with, the future is not predictable. Usually, the best the analyst can do is to identify the driving forces that will determine that future and monitor those forces as they interact to become the future. Scenarios, plausible and provocative stories about how the future might unfold, are a principal vehicle for doing this.. (Pherson, 2009)
	•	According to Mark Kauppi – the program manager for the Intelligence Community’s Counterterrorism Training Program--“counterterrorism intelligence analysis aims to improve our understanding of terrorist activities (what they do), their motivation (why they do what they do), and organizational associations (how they are organized to carry out their activities). The goal in terms of intelligence products ... is to, at a minimum: improve threat awareness of consumers, facilitate the disruption or destruction of terrorist organizations and their activities, (and) provide timely warning and accurate forecasting.” (Marrin, 2002)
	•	According to the CIA’s website, “analysis may be delivered as written reports, oral briefings, or other forms tailored to the needs of the intelligence consumer, including maps, charts, photographs, or models.” (Marrin, 2002)
	•	Intelligence analysts provide targeted intelligence when the needs of the policymaker are known, but policymakers frequently fail to keep analysts informed of policy initiatives or alternatives being considered in the policymaking process. (Marrin, 2002)
	•	No formal mechanism or communications channel has enabled analysts to gain insight into the American policymaking process. Instead, most intelligence analysts acquire their information through informal channels and personal rapport with specific policymakers or their staffs. (Marrin, 2002)
	•	The study of intelligence analysis is a relatively new field. While spying is an old art, and the exploitation and analysis of the spy’s information has always been a part of the business, few practitioners have concentrated their attention on how best to organize analysis for the best possible results. (George, 2004)
	•	Kent became known as the father of modern American intelligence analysis for his efforts to codify the elements of good intelligence analysis, and to argue that intelligence analysis is another social science discipline with its own set of methodological problems. (George, 2004)
	•	Analysis must be disseminated in time for it to be actionable by customers. Analytic elements have the responsibility to be continually aware of events of intelligence interest, of customer activities and schedules, and of intelligence requirements and priorities, in order to provide useful analysis at the right time. (DNI, 2007)
	•	Analysis should be informed by all relevant information available. Analytic elements should identify and address critical information gaps and work with collection activities and data providers to develop access and collection strategies. (DNI, 2007)
	•	Traditional intelligence analysis generates forecasts or explanations based on logical processing of available evidence. (Fishbein and Treverton, 2004)
	•	Traditional analysis is relevant for bounded problems—such as state-to-state diplomacy or internal politics—in which there is a relatively restricted range of outcomes or hypotheses to be evaluated. (Fishbein and Treverton, 2004)
	•	intelligence “analysis” differs from sense-making in some key respects:
	•	it is generally less collective (primary responsibility for sense-making often resides with an individual analyst) and more formal (with ideas shared through the often-adversarial process of coordination rather than through conversation). (Fishbein and Treverton, 2004)
	•	Judgment is an integral part of all intelligence analysis. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Understanding the complex relationship between amount of infor- mation and accuracy of judgment has implications for both the manage- ment and conduct of intelligence analysis. Such an understanding sug- gests analytical procedures and management initiatives that may indeed contribute to more accurate analytical judgments. It also suggests that resources needed to attain a better understanding of the entire analytical process might profitably be diverted from some of the more costly intel- ligence collection programs. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	A more accurate analogy for describing how intelligence analysis should work is medical diagnosis. The doctor observes indicators (symp- toms) of what is happening, uses his or her specialized knowledge of how the body works to develop hypotheses that might explain these observations, conducts tests to collect additional information to evaluate the hypotheses, then makes a diagnosis. This medical analogy focuses attention on the ability to identify and evaluate all plausible hypotheses. Collection is focused narrowly on information that will help to discriminate the relative probability of alternate hypothesis. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Imagination and creativity play important roles in intelligence analysis as in most other human endeavors. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	imagination as well as knowledge is required to reconstruct how a problem appears from the viewpoint of a foreign government. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Creativity is required to question things that have long been taken for granted. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	defining the problem, generating hypotheses, collecting information, evaluating hypotheses, selecting the most likely hypothesis, and the ongoing monitoring of new information. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Decisionmakers usually have little knowledge of the entire intelligence cycle, especially those functions which occur behind the scenes — collection, exploitation, processing, and interpretation/evaluation of the raw information. Their singular exposure to intelligence derives from their receipt of finished intelligence, mostly in the form of an analytic product. Therefore, analysis of raw information has the most impact on the decisionmaker and producing high-quality analytical product should be the highest priority for intelligence agencies. (Stack, 1997)
	•	The business of intelligence must be restricted to reporting the unvarnished facts. Any attempt to bend intelligence to serve political needs other than the truth is a danger as great as the Soviet threat itself. (CIA, 1978)
	•	The goal of intelligence analysis is not to determine the outcome of the policy process, but rather to put the policymaker in the best position possible to make the best-informed decision possible. (Petersen, 2003)
	•	Ambassador Wolfowitz urges that analysts see intelligence assessments as “tools” to help in the development of a policy decision, and not as “weapons” to determine by fiat the outcome of a policy debate.  (Davis, 1996)
	•	In both types of analysis, what is really being expressed is a ‘degree of belief’ in the hypotheses regarding capability and intention respec- tively. In the absence of perfect knowledge, the assessment of capa- bilities will have a range of possible error associated with it that must be provided to the reader. (Omand, 2014)
	•	the analytic process should vigorously scrutinize all available evidence, including clandestine reporting, to ensure that underlying policy goals are not distorting our analysis. (Gates, 1992)
	•	To be useful, intelligence analysis must engage the concerns of policymakers who need studies that relate to the objectives they are trying to achieve. Thus, analysis must be sensitive to the policy context, and the range of options available, to be of any use in making policy. (Betts, 2007)
	•	Analysis that undermines a policy option is most useful if it arrives before a decision to choose that option is made. It may be discomfiting or unwelcome even then, but it has more of a chance of affecting choice. Once policymakers move from decision to implementation, however, their interests become vested. (Betts, 2007)
	•	The challenge remains to make intelligence relevant without making it dishonest by pulling punches in a way that lets policymakers believe what they want. In practical terms, if intelligence is to be useful, its politicization will be a continuum from more to less, with the least being the aim for which professionals strive, zero being unattainable without denuding an analysis of all connection with political reality. (Betts, 2007)
	•	The committees assume that the reality the Intelligence analysts are trying to predict is determinate, and that they are using probabilities in their predictions only because of the lack of knowledge or the imperfect ability of humans to reach the right conclusions from the data in hand. If only all the necessary data had been available to the analysts, and if only analysts were not prone to err, it would be possible to predict with certainty the future regional or global events. (Rosenberg, 2008)
	•	Like intelligence analysts, scientific advisors to policymakers have long prided themselves on ‘‘speaking truth to power.’’ In practice, matters are more complicated. In science advising as in intelligence analysis, ‘‘truth’’ may be probabilistic, and may depend on an advisor’s best educated guess as to the outcome of experiments that have not yet been performed or the interpretation of data that are not quite in point. Like intelligence professionals, scientific advisors must adjust to the needs of their advisees, who bear ultimate responsibility for their decisions. (Weiss, 2008)
	•	like most intelligence analysis, most scientific research is concerned with filling gaps in existing paradigms; revolutionary concepts require years to become established. In principle, this derives from the dictum that ‘‘extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.’’ In practice, scientists’ judgment regarding the quality of evidence often depends on how closely it fits their preconceptions. Abandonment of a fundamental paradigm may owe as much to the death or retirement of an older generation of scientists as to the success of the new model in winning them over. (Weiss, 2008)
	•	The data and models underlying intelligence analysis rarely attain the level of reliability associated with a major scientific theory, such as evolution or continental drift. More usually, they are more nearly comparable to the models used to represent environmental phenomena such as global climate or the pollution of a particular water—or airshed—models that unavoidably incorporate a variety of approximations and proxy variables and are fed incomplete or inadequate data. (Weiss, 2008)
	•	Analysis performed by intelligence personnel assists in building the commander’s knowledge and understanding. ADP 6-0 provides an in-depth discussion on how commanders and staffs process data to progressively develop their knowledge to build and maintain their situational awareness and understanding. (See figure 1-1.) (Army Publishing Directorate, 2020)
	•	Intelligence analysis is a form of analysis specific to the intelligence warfighting function. It is continuous and occurs throughout the intelligence and operations processes. (Army Publishing Directorate, 2020)
	•	Intelligence analysis is the process by which collected information is evaluated and integrated with existing information to facilitate intelligence production (ADP 2-0). (Army Publishing Directorate, 2020)

Intelligence analysis process
	•	The analytic process itself “includes integrating, evaluating, and analyzing all available data--which is often fragmentary and even contradictory--... into a coherent whole, put(ting) the evaluated information in context, and produc(ing) finished intelligence that includes assessments of events and judgments about the implications of the information for the United States.” (Marrin, 2002)
	•	Short deadlines require analysts apply short-cuts, and as a result most current intelligence analysis is based more on informed intuition than structured or rigorous methods. After the piece is drafted it then undergoes coordination, which entails review by other analysts with related geographic knowledge but different disciplinary perspectives. In this way the niche knowledge of the single analyst can be broadened, mistakes corrected, and context from other disciplines brought to bear.47 Finally, the piece of written intelligence undergoes multiple layers of managerial review before being sent to the editors of the daily current intelligence publications. The production process for research intelligence takes longer, but is also usually more intuitive than rigorous. (Marrin, 2002)
Current Intelligence
	•	Current Intelligence “addresses day-to-day events, seeking to apprise consumers of new developments and related background, to assess their significance, to warn of their near-term consequences, and to signal potentially dangerous situations in the near future.” (Marrin, 2002)
	•	Current intelligence production is the least analytical because time constraints do not permit so-called “analytic tradecraft” to be applied. (Marrin, 2002)
	•	Current Intelligence includes the President’s Daily Brief (PDB), the Senior Executive Intelligence Brief (SEIB), and the Economic Executives’ Intelligence Brief (EEIB), according to the CIA’s website. (Marrin, 2002)
Research Intelligence 
	•	Research Intelligence is more in-depth than current intelligence and can be used to support specific operations or decisions, or address a new development in greater detail. (Marrin, 2002)
	•	Research intelligence can also provide a “structured compilation of geographic, demographic, social, military, and political data on foreign countries,” known as “basic intelligence.” (Marrin, 2002)
	•	Research Intelligence includes “Intelligence Reports” which offer longer
	•	treatments of intelligence issues and fill policymaker needs for “basic research and information, responses to specific questions, situation reports, and briefing books.” (Marrin, 2002)
Estimative Intelligence 
	•	Estimative Intelligence “deals with what might be or what might happen. ... (It) starts with the available facts, but then it migrates into the unknown, even the unknowable. (Marrin, 2002)
	•	The main roles of estimative intelligence are to help policymakers navigate the gaps between available facts by suggesting alternative patterns into which those facts might fit and to provide informed assessments of the range and likelihood of possible outcomes.” (Marrin, 2002)
	•	Estimative intelligence can appear in current intelligence or research intelligence, but is highlighted in National Intelligence Estimates (NIEs). NIEs are produced by the entire IC through a complicated coordination process managed by the senior intelligence experts who make up the National Intelligence Council (NIC). (Marrin, 2002)
	•	The US National Intelligence Estimates use the fol- lowing scale. In expressing the overall degree of confidence, High con- fidence generally indicates that the judgments are based on high-quality information, and/or that the nature of the issue makes it possible to render a solid judgment. A ‘high confidence’ judgment is not a fact or a certainty, however, and such judgments still carry a risk of being wrong. Moderate confidence generally means that the information is credibly sourced and plausible but not of sufficient quality or corrobo- rated sufficiently to warrant a higher level of confidence. Low confi- dence generally means that the information’s credibility and/or plausibility is questionable, or that the information is too fragmented or poorly corroborated to make solid analytic inferences, or that we have significant concerns or problems with the sources. (Omand, 2014)
Accurate analysis
	•	Accurate analysis should be balanced, distinguishing facts from their implications and admitting as many reasonable interpretations as the facts allow. Balance in this sense promotes papers or estimates of two types, neither of which is ideal from the policymaker’s viewpoint. (Betts, 2007)
	•	Careful, balanced, accurate papers usually take a long time to produce—they need extra time at each stage for writing, criticism and coor- dination, and revision. Such delays do not harm a long-range estimate. (Betts, 2007)
Warning Intelligence 
	•	Warning Intelligence is a subset of estimative intelligence focusing on “developments that could have sudden and deleterious effects in US security or policy” such as “impending crises” or “long-term dangers.” Countertorrorism intelligence analysis contains a large warning component. (Marrin, 2002)
	•	Operations centers scattered throughout the IC monitor incoming cable traffic and “provide (IC) leadership with 24-hour-a-day alert and warning of global events affecting US interests and helps ensure the accuracy of current intelligence for White House level decisionmakers.” (Marrin, 2002)
	•	Warning intelligence can be provided through regular current and research intelligence and a number of IC “products specifically devoted to warning.” (Marrin, 2002)
Dissenting opinions
	•	In many cases the ambiguity of the intelligence information is such that differing hypotheses regarding the meaning of the event can exist at the same time. At times, intelligence analysts will disagree as to the implications of an event, indicating the existence of multiple hypotheses. (Marrin, 2004)
	•	The inclusion of dissenting opinions in finished intelligence would provide both intelligence managers and policymakers a sense of the uncertainty of the judgment, plausible alternative interpretations, and possible insight regarding further intelligence collection requirements. (Marrin, 2004)
	•	Dissenting analysis should be presented as minority opinions, but there should not be an equally persuasive separate estimate by a "Team B." (Stack, 1997)
Alternative Analysis
	•	Some issues — particularly those of great importance or complexity—are ill-served by a single analytical judgment or estimate. Alternative formats and methodologies could instead be used to present existing uncertainties in a more useful format. Alternative analysis spans a range of product possibilities including contingency analysis (if=then), scenarios, Team A=Team B exercises (entailing consultations with outside experts), role-playing, or other unconventional methods. The basic idea is to use alternative formats for exploring issues and building theories in such a way that assumptions become explicit, conventional wisdom challenged, and the reasons for uncertainty explained. (Marrin, 2004)
Multiple advocacy
	•	Even if worst-case analysis is promulgated in principle, it will be compromised in practice. Routinization corrodes sensitivity. Every day that an expected threat does not materialize further dulls receptivity to the reality of danger. (Betts, 2007)
	•	Even if worst-case analysis is promulgated in principle, it will be compromised in practice. Routinization corrodes sensitivity. Every day that an expected threat does not materialize further dulls receptivity to the reality of danger. (Betts, 2007)
	•	The efficacy of multiple advocacy (which is greatest when data is manageable and ambiguity low) may vary inversely with the potential for intelligence failure (which is great- est when data is confusing and uncertainty high). (Betts, 2007)
Worst-case analysis
	•	Acting on worst-case analysis requires extraordinary expense, risks being coun- terproductive if it is effective (by provoking enemy countermeasures or preemption), and is likely to be ineffective because routinization will discredit it. (Betts, 2007)
	•	Worst-case analysis as a standard norm would also exacerbate the cry wolf syndrome. (Betts, 2007)
	•	Even if worst-case analysis is promulgated in principle, it will be compromised in practice. Routinization corrodes sensitivity. Every day that an expected threat does not materialize further dulls receptivity to the reality of danger. (Betts, 2007)
Analytical error
	•	Employing better analytic tradecraft is the mantra usually heard when senior analytic managers address analytic errors. (George, 2010)
Analytic pyramid
	•	Kent developed the concept of the analytic pyramid, featuring a wide base of factual information and sides comprised of sound assumptions, which pointed to the most likely future scenario at the apex. (Heuer, 1999)
Linchpin analysis
	•	MacEachin advocated an approach to structured argumentation called “linchpin analysis,” to which he contributed muscular terms designed to overcome many CIA professionals’ distaste for academic no- menclature. The standard academic term “key variables” became driv- ers. “Hypotheses” concerning drivers became linchpins—assumptions underlying the argument—and these had to be explicitly spelled out. MacEachin also urged that greater attention be paid to analytical pro- cesses for alerting policymakers to changes in circumstances that would increase the likelihood of alternative scenarios. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Called ‘‘linchpin analysis,’’ intelligence assessments were to be constructed by using the following steps: Identify the main uncertain factors or key variables (drivers) that will determine an outcome. Identify working assumptions (linchpin premises) about how the key drivers will operate. Advance convincing evidence and reasoning to support the linchpin premises. Address any indicators or signposts that would render linchpin premises unreliable. Ask what dramatic events or triggers could reverse the expected outcomes. (George, 2004)
	•	key assumptions that underpin the preferred conclusions. (Weiss, 2008)
Analysis of Competing Hypotheses
	•	Heuer’s concept of “Analysis of Competing Hypotheses” (ACH) is among his most important contributions to the development of an intelligence analysis methodology. 
	•	At the core of ACH is the notion of competition among a series of plausible hypotheses to see which ones survive a gauntlet of testing for compatibility with available information. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	The surviving hypotheses—those that have not been disproved—are sub- jected to further testing. ACH, Heuer concedes, will not always yield the right answer. But it can help analysts overcome the cognitive limitations discussed in his book. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Some analysts who use ACH follow Heuer’s full eight-step methodology. More often, they employ some elements of ACH—especially the use of available information to challenge the hypotheses that the analyst favors the most. (Heuer, 1999)
Serious analysis
	•	Serious analysis of probability requires identification and assessment of the strength and interaction of the many variables that will determine the outcome of a situation. (Heuer, 1999)
Critical thinking
	•	We review the consensus of expert opinion concerning the psychology of intelligence analysis, as a form of critical thinking. This consensus details a number of ways in which the cognitive work is difficult. (Hoffman et al., 2011)
	•	Some sources of difficulty have to do with the nature of the critical thinking itself, specifically the challenge of anticipating human activity, which we call ‘indeterminate causation’. (Hoffman et al., 2011)
	•	Intelligence analysts have to be capable of ‘critical thinking’, a requirement that is made salient by intelligence failures. For example, US Army Major Nathan Murphy recently expressed concerns about the counterterrorism effort saying that ‘We have neglected the single point of failure which is to be able to think critically’ (quoted in Ricks 2010), suggesting a gap in the cognitive capacities required to overcome problem difficulty and complexity. (Hoffman et al., 2011)
	•	The critical thinking aspect of intelligence analysis has been described in many ways: connecting the dots; finding the needle in the haystack; separating the wheat from the chaff; putting together a puzzle even when you see only the back and you are not given any of the edges; and transforming data into information into knowledge (e.g., Senator 2002). (Hoffman et al., 2011)
	•	It can certainly be said that analytical work is difficult because it is a form of critical thinking, and critical thinking is difficult (Cohen and Freeman 1997, Cohen et al. 1998, Feltovich et al. 2001, Elm et al. 2005, Moore and Krizan 2005, Moore 2006, 2010, Elder and Paul 2007, Henderson et al. 2010, Klein (this issue)). (Hoffman et al., 2011)
	•	Research and theory on critical thinking in the field of psychology highlights the fact that critical thinking is difficult (for people in general), the fact that critical thinking is not put to use nearly as often as it should be (by people in general), and the fact that it links strongly to curiosity, a motive that varies considerably in strength from person to person (Litman et al. 2005, Litman 2005, 2008, Litman and Silva 2006, there is a large literature on critical thinking and critical thinking training, see http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/awc- thkg.htm#critical). (Hoffman et al., 2011)
	•	Combined with the fact that sound critical thinking often has desirable consequences (i.e. difficult problems are solved), critical thinking, like sound intelligence analysis, is ‘highly prized’ (Smith 2010). (Hoffman et al., 2011)
	•	numerous studies have examined the field of intelligence analysis as a form as critical thinking, also asking questions about teaching analysis as a form of critical thinking, and also offering suggestions for methods and models (e.g. Moore, 2006). (Hoffman et al., 2011)
	•	As Smith (2010) points out, consensus about the nature of critical thinking is that it requires: (1) the ability to identify assumptions and (2) the ability to conceive of alternative assumptions. (Hoffman et al., 2011)
	•	The cognitive difficulty of critical thinking and sensemaking are amplified by the broader context of the work, that is, the ways in which jobs are specified. Researchers who have studied intelligence analysis and related domains of information synthesis and analysis (e.g. emergency response), show a clear consensus that analysis is difficult because of a cluster of factors including workload, time pressure, high stakes and high uncertainty (Cohen and Freeman 1997, Pascual and Henderson 1997, Schrodt and Gener 1998, Hutchins et al. 2007, Song et al. 2010). (Hoffman et al., 2011)
	•	According to Heuer (1999, see also Heuer and Pherson 2010) the following activities can be structured and thereby insure the soundness of critical thinking: Recognising and clearly delineating assumptions and chains of inference, Determining and specifying uncertainty, Determining and specifying the diagnosticity of evidence, Disconfirmatory reasoning, pitting competing hypotheses against the evidence, Considering alternative interpretations and (re)consideration of evidence that might be ignored on the basis of mind-set, Analysis of multiple alternative and competing hypotheses, Enhancing analysts’ metacognitive awareness and understanding of their own thinking, ‘What-if ’ reasoning. (Hoffman et al., 2011)

Good intelligence analysis
	•	Good intelligence analysis can aid strategists in understanding an enemy’s intentions and capabilities, in considering the broader context of events and how others might behave, and in forecasting the short- and long-term risks and opportunities presented by different courses of action. (George, 2004)
	•	the measure of good analysis was the ability to establish one or more hypotheses that best approximate a situation’s ground truth. (George, 2004)
Directorate Intelligence’s analytical objectives
	•	As Heuer saw it, the Directorate’s analytical objectives should be to: Encourage products that clearly delineate their assumptions and chains of inference and specify the degree and source of uncertainty involved in the conclusions. Support analyses that periodically reexamine key problems from the ground up in order to avoid the pitfalls of the incremental approach. Emphasize procedures that expose and elaborate alternative points of view. Educate consumers about the limitations as well as the capabilities of intelligence analysis; define a set of realistic expectations as a standard against which to judge analytical performance. (George, 2004)
Analytic assessments
	•	Analytic assessments must not be distorted by, nor shaped for, advocacy of a particular audience, agenda, or policy viewpoint. (DNI, 2007)
Analytic judgments
	•	Analytic judgments must not be influenced by the force of preference for a particular policy. (DNI, 2007)
Intelligence judgment
	•	Intelligence judgments require the ability to imagine possible causes and outcomes of a current situation. All possible outcomes are not given. The analyst must think of them by imagining scenarios that explicate how they might come about. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	predictions by analysts convey little of value to policymakers. Even if analysts have done their homework and studied the available evidence, policymakers learn little from unsubstantiated opinion. Absent the evidence on which analysts judgments are based, the policymaker has only a bureaucratic interest in intelligence judgments, and that only because other policy makers may appeal to the authority of intelligence opinion to lever policy debates when they are short of evidence to make their case. (Davis, 1996)

Analytic products
	•	Analytic products should identity underlying sources and methodologies upon which judgments are based, and use source descriptors in accordance with lCD 206, Sourcing Requirements/or Disseminated Analytic Products, to describe factors affecting source quality and credibility. Such factors can include accuracy and completeness, possible denial and deception, age and continued currency of information, and technical elements of collection as well as source access, validation, motivation, possible bias, or expertise. Source summary statements, described in lCD 206, are strongly encouraged and should be used to provide a holistic assessment ofthe strengths or weaknesses in the source base and explain which sources are most important to key analytic judgments. (DNI, 2007)
	•	Analytic products should indicate and explain the basis for the uncertainties associated with major analytic judgments, specifically the likelihood of occurrence of an event or development, and the analyst's confidence in the basis for this judgment. Degrees of likelihood encompass a full spectrum from remote to nearly certain. Analysts' confidence in an assessment or judgment may be based on the logic and evidentiary base that underpin it, including the quantity and quality of source material, and their understanding of the topic. (DNI, 2007)
	•	Analytic products should note causes of uncertainty (e.g., type, currency, and amount of information, knowledge gaps, and the nature ofthe issue) and explain how uncertainties affect analysis (e.g., to what degree and how a judgment depends on assumptions). As appropriate, products should identify indicators that would alter the levels of uncertainty for major analytic judgments. Consistency in the terms used and the supporting information and logic advanced is critical to success in expressing uncertainty, regardless of whether likelihood or confidence expressions are used. (DNI, 2007)
	•	Analytic products should clearly distinguish statements that convey underlying intelligence information used in analysis from statements that convey assumptions or judgments. Assumptions are defined as suppositions used to frame or support an argument; assumptions affect analytic interpretation of underlying intelligence information. Judgments are defined as conclusions based on underlying intelligence information, analysis, and assumptions. Products should state assumptions explicitly when they serve as the linchpin of an argument or when they bridge key infonnation gaps. Products should explain the implications for judgments if assumptions prove to be incorrect. Products also should, as appropriate, identify indicators that, if detected, would alter judgments. (DNI, 2007)
	•	Analytic products should provide information and insight on issues relevant to the customers of U.S. intelligence and address the implications of the information and analysis they provide. Products should add value by addressing prospects, context, threats, or factors affecting opportunities for action. (DNI, 2007)
	•	Analytic products should present a clear main analytic message up front. Products containing multiple judgments should have a main analytic message that is drawn collectively from those judgments. All analytic judgments should be effectively supported by relevant intelligence information and coherent reasoning. Language and syntax should convey meaning unambiguously. Products should be internally consistent and acknowledge significant supporting and contrary information affecting judgments. (DNI, 2007)
	•	Analytic products should state how their major judgments on a topic are consistent with or represent a change from those in previously published analysis, or represent initial coverage of a topic. Products need not be lengthy or detailed in explaining change or consistency. They should avoid using boilerplate language, however, and should make clear how new information or different reasoning led to the judgments expressed in them. Recurrent products such as daily crisis reports should note any changes in judgments; absent changes, recurrent products need not confirm consistency with previous editions. Significant differences in analytic judgment, such as between two IC analytic elements, should be fully considered and brought to the attention of customers. (DNI, 2007)
	•	Analytic products should apply expertise and logic to make the most accurate judgments and assessments possible, based on the information available and known information gaps. In doing so, analytic products should present all judgments that would be useful to customers, and should not avoid difficult judgments in order to minimize the risk of being wrong. Inherent to the concept of accuracy is that the analytic message a customer receives should be the one the analyst intended to send. Therefore, analytic products should express judgments as clearly and precisely as possible, reducing ambiguity by addressing the likelihood, timing, and nature ofthe outcome or development. Clarity ofmeaning permits assessment for accuracy when all necessary information is available. (DNI, 2007)
	•	Analytic products should incorporate visual information to clarify an analytic message and to complement or enhance the presentation ofdata and analysis. In particular, visual presentations should be used when information or concepts (e.g., spatial or temporal relationships) can be conveyed better in graphic form (e.g., tables, flow charts, images) than in written text. Visual infornmation may range from plain presentation o f intelligence information to interactive displays for complex information and analytic concepts. All ofthe content in an analytic product may be presented visually. Visual information should always be clear and pertinent to the product's subject. Analytic content in visual information should also adhere to other analytic tradecraft standards. (DNI, 2007)
Creative analytical product
	•	A creative analytical product shows a flair for devising imaginative or innovative—but also accurate and effective—ways to fulfill any of the major requirements of analysis: gathering information, analyzing information, documenting evidence, and/or presenting conclusions. Tapping unusual sources of data, asking new questions, applying unusual analytic methods, and developing new types of products or new ways of fitting analysis to the needs of consumers are all examples of creative activity. (Heuer, 1999)

Analytical tradecraft
	•	Weaknesses and biases inherent in human thinking processes can be demonstrated through carefully designed experiments. They can be alleviated by conscious application of tools and techniques that should be in the analytical tradecraft toolkit of all intelligence analysts. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Most writers who focus on analytic tradecraft – whether they realize it or not – portray the intelligence analysis process as a version of the scientific method. Accordingly, most recommendations for improving intelligence analysis are akin to the lessons taught in graduate-level methodology courses; use good data, prevent bias, test hypotheses through a competitive process, and so on. (Marrin, 2002)
	•	Out of this review came the most noticeable change in the CIA’s analytical tradecraft since the establishment of the Intelligence Directorate. In simple terms, new DI guidelines were crafted to make CIA analysis transparent to the policymaker, which paralleled similar guidance that General Colin Powell once gave to his military intelligence staff: What do we know? How do we know it? What do we not know? And only lastly, what do we think? (George, 2004)
	•	Many of the analytic tradecraft measures implemented by the Intelligence Community (IC) in the wake of the 9/11 and Iraq weapons of mass destruction (WMD) intelligence failures are not new. (Marchio, 2014)
	•	Analytical tradecraft refers to the body of specific methods used for intelligence analysis. The purpose of analytical tradecraft improves the quality of the product and adds value for the intelligence product consumer. (McGlynn and Garner, 2018)
	•	Utilizing tradecraft principles and practices enhances the end product, providing the analyst with needed consumer feedback to clarify “those questions that most need answering,” thus focusing the analyst and assisting in managing a deluge of information, discerning trends, and identifying attemps at deception. (McGlynn and Garner, 2018)
Intelligence agencies
	•	Intelligence agencies in the information age do have more competition for the attention of policymakers. (Betts, 2007)
	•	Within any organization, individual analysts frequently reach different judgments about the quality of information, the correct interpretation of data, and the likely implications of any foreign development. (George, 2010)
	•	Intelligence agencies too hate being blamed, in what are invariably called intelligence failures, for the inevitable uncertainties of the world. (Omand, 2014)
	•	The goal of intelligence agencies should be to produce reports, documents, and briefs which meet the six principles outlined by Captain William Brei — accuracy, objectivity, usability, relevance, readiness, and timeliness. (Stack, 1997)
	•	Intelligence agencies can also reasonably seek to ‘create’ a need for their product, in the way in which Apple ‘created’ a market for the iPod, a device that would not have occurred to the bulk of consumers to ask for but which is now regarded by them as indispensable. (Omand, 2014)
	•	It is also important that agencies do not see themselves as competing with each other for the attention of customers or manipulating the distribution of intelligence reporting to further some office politics of their customers. (Omand, 2014)
	•	When consumers abdicate, intelligence managers try to provide policy-relevant guidance themselves. In the mid-1970s the director of central intelligence established the key intelligence questions (KIQs) to “identify topics of particular interest to national policymakers.” Departmental intelligence agencies set comparable mechanisms for determin- ing requirements. (Betts, 2007)

Intelligence organisation
	•	intelligence organisations have their unique legacies, methods and allegiances. Analysts know that outcomes are often caused by accident, blunder, coincidence, the unintended consequence of well-intentioned policy, improperly executed orders, bargaining among semi-independent bureaucratic entities or following standard operating procedures under inappropriate circumstances (Heuer 1999, p. 120). (Hoffman et al., 2011)
	•	Numerous authors have outlined the organisational and cultural aspects of resistance to change in the intelligence community (e.g. Johnston 2005, Henderson et al. 2008a,b). The analyst’s audiences (policy makers, decision makers) are dynamic and non- monolithic in that they too have multiple and contingent responsibilities and allegiances. Different people and different organisations work to different time frames – they have different planning windows, and only look so far into the future. Syncing these people/ levels causes problems, especially during times when the tempo of work is increasing. (Hoffman et al., 2011)
	•	Researchers who have studied intelligence analysis and related domains of information synthesis and analysis (e.g. emergency response), show a clear consensus that analysis is difficult because of a cluster of factors including workload, time pressure, high stakes and high uncertainty (Cohen and Freeman 1997, Pascual and Henderson 1997, Schrodt and Gener 1998, Hutchins et al. 2007, Song et al. 2010). (Hoffman et al., 2011)
	•	Changes to organisational cultures (policies, procedures and disincentives) certainly have great potential for eliminating some unnecessary difficulties (e.g. the burdens of reporting). But they could not possibly eliminate the difficulties inherent in problems created by a complex and dynamic world. (Hoffman et al., 2011)
Modern intelligence organisation
	•	The modern intelligence organisation must be a self-reflective ‘learning organisation’ (Garin 2003). (Hoffman et al., 2011)
Intelligence estimation
	•	an exercise in foresight, and it is the difference between these two modes of thought—hindsight and foresight—that seems to be a source of bias. (Heuer, 1999)
Estimative intelligence
	•	Because estimative intelligence involves deliberate analysis and long-term study, this is the only type of strategic intelligence where competitive analysis could be utilized. (Stack, 1997)
	•	By definition, estimative intelligence should present the decisionmaker with the very best estimate as to what is likely to occur, not just what might occur, so that rational decisions of such magnitude and importance can be made. (Stack, 1997)
	•	An argument for including competitive analysis in estimative intelligence is that adding "worst-case," multiple advocacy, or devil's advocacy assessments would provide policymakers with more alternatives so that ultimately they could make rational decisions. This argument rests on a faulty assumption. It assumes that the policymaker would treat formalized devil's advocacy/worst-case assessments with equal weight as the "real" analysis provided, and that the policymaker would accept evidence contrary to his predispositions and act on this information. In reality, however, policymakers will most likely reject the choice or evidence which contrasts with their beliefs or life experiences. (Stack, 1997)
	•	Intelligence analysts have therefore to be brought up to shun vague terms, of the type that slip out when we are not sure but do not want to admit it, such as ‘more or less’, or ‘apparently’, or that standby ‘on the one hand/on the other hand’. The Butler Inquiry found that there was an unjustified mystique amongst the writers of intelligence assess- ments that fine distinctions such as that between ‘intelligence indicates’ and ‘intelligence shows’ would convey meaning to the readers, but in truth such word-smithing passes them by. Words that concentrate meaning in terms of quantifiers (most, several or few) or probabilities (likely, certain) need to be handled with care. Terms such as probably, likely, very likely, or almost certainly are held to indicate a greater than even chance. The terms unlikely and remote indicate a less then even chance that an event will occur; they do not imply that an event will not occur. Terms such as might or may reflect situations in which we are unable to assess the likelihood, generally because relevant information is unavailable, sketchy, or fragmented. Terms such as we cannot dismiss, we cannot rule out, or we cannot discount reflect an unlikely, improbable, or remote event whose consequences are such that it war- rants mentioning. (Omand, 2014)
	•	There are some unambiguous facts uncovered in intelligence work. But most of the evidence base suffers from fuzziness in two ways: it will help in forming sound judgments in assessments to be able to dis- tinguish when we are dealing ‘uncertainty’ due to inevitable lack of precision in the intelligence reports we have—our measurements of reality—and that due to ‘fuzziness’ because of the definitions of reality we are using. There are, as we have just been discussing, degrees of belief in the evidence; and the evidential categories themselves may not be straightforward with clean edges. (Omand, 2014)
	•	It's time to require national security analysts to assign numerical probabilities to their professional estimates and assessments as both a matter of rigor and of record. Policymakers can't weigh the risks associated with their decisions if they can't see how confident analysts are in the evidence and conclusions used to justify those decisions. The notion of imposing intelligence accountability without intelligent counting -- without numbers -- is a fool's errand. (Schrage, 2005)
	•	Key estimates and analytic insights rarely come with explicit probabilities attached. (Schrage, 2005)
	•	Intelligence analysts "would rather use words than numbers to describe how confident we are in our analysis," a senior CIA officer who's served for more than 20 years told me. Moreover, "most consumers of intelligence aren't particularly sophisticated when it comes to probabilistic analysis. They like words and pictures, too. My experience is that [they] prefer briefings that don't center on numerical calculation. That's not to say we can't do it, but there's really not that much demand for it." (Schrage, 2005)
	•	Yes, analysts and their agencies will attempt to "game" the numbers. Yes, policymakers will apply political pressure for analysts and agencies to alter their declared odds. All risk- assessment methods are corruptible. (Schrage, 2005)
	•	Practically all substantive intelligence people constantly make estimates. (Kent, 1964)
	•	The use of probability propositions is widespread in Intelligence estimation and strategic forecasts, as in everyday life. (Rosenberg, 2008)
	•	This paper tries to analyze philosophically a central concept of the Intelligence estimation process, the concept of probability. (Rosenberg, 2008)
	•	I believe the source of this misconception is the tendency to think that the use of probabilities by analysts is only meant to represent the analysts’ imperfection (both in terms of being human and in terms of the lack of information available). (Rosenberg, 2008)
	•	Like experts in many other fields, intelligence analysts tend to be overconfident regarding the accuracy of their judgments at high levels of probability and under-confident at low levels. Professor Steven Rieber recommends systematic ‘‘calibration feedback’’ to improve the accuracy of analysts’ estimates of the probability they assign to intelligence judgments. This approach would also facilitate feedback to the analysts regarding their level of confidence in their own judgment. (Weiss, 2008)
	•	
	•	Intelligence analysts are not the only expert advisers who have resisted pressure to give their clients a clear statement of the uncertainty they associate with their professional opinions. Scientific advisers, environmental activists, lawyers, and any number of other professions avoid making explicit estimates of this uncertainty, in each case using well-established stratagems and offering elaborate rationalizations for ignoring available tools until they are forced to use them by outside pressures.
	•	Scientific advisory committees of all kinds have been reluctant to attach precise estimates of uncertainty to their statements of the state of the science relevant to a policy or regulatory issue. Disagreements among experts are frequently papered over with ambiguous language, while scientific assertions not thought to be adequately proven are typically surrounded by general qualifiers. This is in part due to attitudes shared with the intelligence analyst: namely, the suspicion that political clients are unable to understand and use probabilistic information, and the fear that opponents may seize on admissions of uncertainty to attack the basis of later policy recommendations. But it also stems from the socialization of the scientist to the effect that a scientific assertion to the public should be presented either as an accepted fact or as a conjecture or suggestion, with nothing in between. (Weiss, 2008)

Intelligence limitations
Difficulties
	•	Difficulties are problematic properties in the nature of the military intelligence information (ambiguity, inconsistency) which exacerbate the complexity of integrating multiple indicators into a single assessment. When these are not severe they can be overcome by skillfully using information processing tools. (Honig, 2007)
Pathologies
	•	Pathologies are types of behavior associated with organizational life and human psychology that distort information processing. These are not as severe as claimed by Orthodox scholars. (Honig, 2007)
Intrinsic Limitations
	•	Intrinsic Limitations are the intentions, motivations, and reasons behind the enemy’s actions (let alone his ‘‘nature’’) that inevitably remain shrouded in inherent uncertainty. (Honig, 2007)
	•	Since assessing intentions requires a ‘‘profound understanding of the other side,’’ the information processing skills of the analysts are least adequate for this task. (Honig, 2007)
HUMINT
	•	They note that the constant possibility of disinformation forces intelligence officers to assess their sources’ credibility, especially HUMINT (human intelligence) sources, against the veracity of their predictions. (Honig, 2007)
	•	‘‘false alarms’’ paradoxically reduce the source’s credibility, although the information may be true (i.e., not disinformation). (Honig, 2007)
	•	Most human-source information is second hand at best. (Heuer, 1999)
Nexus Intelligence – Policy
	•	policymakers prefer to make decisions based on facts rather than analysis, and on the basis of certainty rather than ambiguity. (Dahl, 2013)
	•	The literature on intelligence–policy relations also suggests that a closer rela- tionship between intelligence officials and policymakers can help improve the qual- ity of assessments and analysis and make it more likely that intelligence will be listened to. (Dahl, 2013)
	•	the justification of a mission (in this case, readiness for future contingencies rather than demonstrating current success on the battlefield) prompts pessimistic estimates by military analysts, while autono- mous analysts without budgetary axes to grind, but with biases similar to those in the intellectual community, tend toward more relaxed predictions. (Betts, 2007)
	•	Analysis and decision are interactive rather than sequential processes. (Betts, 2007)
	•	Policymakers, with some justification, do not think that partial or ambiguous warnings should exonerate intelligence. For them the func- tion of intelligence is not just to alert them to danger but to give an answer—in effect, to make the strategic decision about how to respond. (Betts, 2007)
	•	The dominance of operational authorities over intelligence special- ists and the trade-off between objectivity and influence are related problems. Operators have more influence in decision making but are less capable of unbiased interpretation of evidence because they have a vested interest in the success of their operations. (Betts, 2007)
	•	The dominance of operational authorities over intelligence special- ists and the trade-off between objectivity and influence are related problems. Operators have more influence in decision making but are less capable of unbiased interpretation of evidence because they have a vested interest in the success of their operations. (Betts, 2007)
	•	There is always tension between what fa- cilitates timely decision and what promotes thoroughness and accuracy in assessment. (Betts, 2007)
	•	Experts usually are better predictors than those who know less about a question, but in unusual situations the nonexpert may do better. Intelligence and policy certainly cannot live without experts. (Betts, 2007)
	•	Sherman Kent, the first director of CIA’s Office of National Estimates, was one of the first to recognize problems of communication caused by imprecise statements of uncertainty. Unfortunately, several decades after Kent was first jolted by how policymakers interpreted the term “serious possibility” in a national estimate, this miscommunication between analysts and policymakers, and between analysts, is still a common occurrence. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	the physical separation between analyst and policymaker impedes the creation of these personal relationships. (Marrin, 2002)
	•	The Intelligence Community has instituted a number of structural and procedural changes – and intelligence authors have suggested even more--to decrease the distance between analysts and policymakers. The IC is already assigning a small number of senior analysts to policymaker staffs, detailing analysts to help with a particular issue such as a treaty negotiation, and providing analytic “liasons” to entire institutions to serve as focal points for intelligence support. (Marrin, 2002)
	•	Kent argued that intelligence analysts must not get too close to policymakers because the result would be skewed intelligence analysis. This traditionalist theory of the intelligence-policy relationship has been replaced by a more modernist view that not only does intelligence exist to serve policy, but that the relationship between the two requires closeness and continuous interaction. (Stack, 1997)
	•	If intelligence exists to serve policy, then intelligence products provided to decisionmakers must contain hard-hitting, focused analysis relevant to current policy issues. (Stack, 1997)
	•	The business of intelligence must be restricted to reporting the unvarnished facts. Any attempt to bend intelligence to serve political needs other than the truth is a danger as great as the Soviet threat itself. (CIA, 1978)
	•	Experienced policy officials base their relations with intelligence analysts on professional self-interest—the need for effective support to meet demanding agendas. (Davis, 1995)
	•	the terms of engagement between intelligence analyst and policymaker are still ill-defined doctrinally and thus practiced as much to suit the immediate preferences of the players on both sides of the relationship as to meet the fundamental demands of sound policymaking. The quest to join sage principle what should work to solid practice what does is more important than ever in post Cold War America, as resources for intelligence support of policymaking are cut back more rapidly than responsibilities. (Davis, 1995)
The Ambassador's framework for defining the requirements for sound intelligence policy relations consists of four key points: Roughly 90 percent of what passes for national security analysis in the US Government, including structured study of events overseas, is done by intelligence analysts. The national interest requires that this effort be effectively joined to the policymaking process. The officials who carry most of the day-to-day burden of policymaking on key issues are so besieged by time-consuming responsibilities that decisions on how much to stay informed on events overseas and in what way are narrowly based on self interest in managing the pressures and getting the job done. Intelligence professionals have to carry nearly all the burden to convince each key policy official that they are committed to servicing his or her analytic needs via customized expert support. Thus, to meet their responsibilities in promoting the national interest, intelligence professionals have to become expert not only on substantive issues but also on serving the self interest of policy professionals by providing specialized analytic support. (Davis, 1995)
	•	intelligence analysts should help key policymakers make the best game plan by telling them what they do not know or appreciate sufficiently. (Davis, 1995)
	•	Policymakers do not as a rule know what intelligence analysts can do for them. They read Estimates, think pieces, the NID, and say, in effect, What does this have to do with my problems? They do not see it as their job to teach analysts how to be helpful. Besides, they would not have the time. (Davis, 1995)
	•	Q: How would you combine your various recommendations for Agency analysts into a program? If you wereadvising the DCI or DDI, what measures would youpropose to enhance the effectiveness of relationsbetween analysts and policy decisionmakers?7A: Thank you for letting me know in advance this question was coming. It is a good question, and I have givenit considerable thought. Let see if the seven measuresI have sketched out add up to a program.1. Identify the 30 or so senior policy officials who count those who really carry weight with administration Cabinet officers on key foreign policy issues. These officials, usually assistant secretaries in policy departments or special assistants to the President on the NSC Staff, regularly set the thinking of NSC principals on major policy decisions. As a rule, these are the assessors of foreign governments, or the analysts of last resort. To contribute to sounder policymaking, intelligence analysts have to reach this group. Remember, the list of policy notables has to be carefully worked out and kept up to date, because office titles do not always reflect real policy weight.2. Approach the policy officials who count as if they were motivated solely by self interest. Their self-interest has to be worked on because they are just too busy to allow either institutional considerations or personal friendships to determine their attitude toward intelligence analysts.3. Learn as much as you can about each senior official. Study them as carefully as you do foreign leaders. For example, read everything they have written on the subjects in their policy portfolios. Check them out through mutual contacts.4. Take the initiative to establish ties. This is an essential obligation of intelligence managers, because policy officials will rarely seek them out. For new appointees, send a letter asking for an appointment and spelling out your areas of expertise and the services you are ready to extend. For serving officials, anticipate a major pending visitor event and offer to send over your analysts for a briefing on any one of several related aspects. For example, if the prime minister from Denmark is to visit the President, the DI manager should signal that he will bring over his Denmark analyst to fill the policymaker in on any gaps in understanding in time for the latter to prepare briefing memos for his or her principal, be it the Secretary of State or the President.Whenever DI managers know of travel plans by a key policy official, offer to send over country analysts who can fill in the officials knowledge on are as of his choice.when it is needed, he will provide in exchange access to the real policy agenda. But policy officials come and go, and the Agency has to take care of those with talent at starting over again with newcomers who, as almost always will be the case, will not seek you out.Final Thoughts Have the DCI set up luncheon meetings in town(CIA Headquarters is just too inconvenient), at which analysts and their managers can establish their credentials as entrepreneurial experts.5. Customize intelligence papers and briefings to solidify the relationship. Many policy officials, overwhelmed by the volume both of their activities and of seemingly important information, will welcome specialized newsletters. They will welcome even one-page summaries of key events overseas that provide the kind of information and analysis they want at the time of day or week they prefer to set aside for keeping up with developments. For the same reason fear of being overwhelmed many will welcome customized briefings and memos relating to their policymaking responsibilities on matters on which theDI country analyst is much better informed than they can be or than anyone else in the government. Give them something they will really miss if they do not get it.6. Place the best and most promising analysts on tours in the policy world. The Agency could offer, free of charge, 50 first-rate people to policy officials around town. Intelligence officers can learn something about how to use intelligence resources effectively by reading about policymaking. You can learn some more by periodic visits to a policymaker office. But the best way to learn about a different bureaucracy is just the same as the best way to learn about any alien tribe go live with them for a coupie of years.7. Reward those managers and analysts who are successful in gaining and maintaining access. As a rule, once a win-win relationship takes hold, momentum will keep it going. Once the policy official knows the intelligence unit can and will deliver support. (Davis, 1995)
	•	Policymakers need support from intelligence to help deal with uncertainty. Thus, policy officials come to respect and rely on analysts and managers who appreciate this aspect of the decision process. (Davis, 1996)
	•	Ambassador Wolfowitz believes effective management of uncertainty and related challenges to sound decision-making requires close cooperation between policy and intelligence officers. The analyst and the collector have to know the operational agendas of policymakers and to understand the continuous and largely informal processes by which they come to decision. Similarly, policymakers have to get close enough to intelligence to provide direct guidance to the collection and analytic processes. (Davis, 1996)
	•	Both the policy and the intelligence sides suffer, as does the national interest, whenever principles or practices are allowed to interfere with close professional cooperation. (Davis, 1996)
	•	Artificial separation of intelligence and policy, in contrast, serves only to degrade the performance of both systems. (Davis, 1996)
	•	Intelligence organizations have to make their own processes transparent to policymakers. Rather than  polluting the intelligence ethic, policymakers understanding of the collection and production processes enables them better to direct the analysts unique resources to what is most needed in the battle with uncertainty an objective and lucid examination of the issues causing the most confusion. (Davis, 1996)
	•	predictions by analysts convey little of value to policymakers. Even if analysts have done their homework and studied the available evidence, policymakers learn little from unsubstantiated opinion. Absent the evidence on which analysts judgments are based, the policymaker has only a bureaucratic interest in intelligence judgments, and that only because other policy makers may appeal to the authority of intelligence opinion to lever policy debates when they are short of evidence to make their case. (Davis, 1996)
	•	Policymakers benefit when they can take into account what the analysts see as the full range of possible outcomes on a tough issue. (Davis, 1996) 
	•	Intelligence should give the policy officials heavily engaged in working an issue some time to adjust to the new findings. (Davis, 1996)
	•	The reason things often appear to go wrong when crisis looms is because the quality of the relationships involved between leaders and advisers, measured in terms of trust and mutual understanding, and at times the personality of the decision-maker, is not enough to cope with the emotional pressures of the moment. (Omand, 2014)
	•	The problem of politicization is as old as old as the intlligence business. (Gates, 1992)
	•	In dealing with policymakers, we also need to keep in mind our role as intelligence analysts. Managers and analysts alike should meet with policymakers on a regular basis to exchange views and explore new ideas. In today's changing world, however, we must guard against taking on tasks that do not deal with intelligence topics and may be intended instead to drive a specific policy agenda. Managers and analysts need to discuss such situations candidly and products that address only the intelligence issues at hand. (Gates, 1992)
	•	Managers must strive in every interaction they have with analysts and managers to ensure all communications are clear. Managers must be able to state clearly why they disagree with a judgment, or how they want a logical argument reconstructed. We cannot simply say we don't like it and we'll know what we want when we see it. That is more than a copout, that is a prescription for trouble. (Gates, 1992)
	•	At times, intelligence is politicized and presented to policy makers in a way that justifies their preconceptions and preferred policies. (Byman, 2005)
Intelligence to please syndrome
	•	This syndrome can occur when intelligence analysts are directly pressured by policy makers to produce estimates that support an ongoing program or a preferred initiative, a situation similar to the conspiracy alleged by Adams. (Wirtz, 1991)
	•	the syndrome also can be linked to less diabolical causes: intelligence analysts sometimes supply estimates that support a given course of action because they simply desire to please policy makers. (Wirtz, 1991)
	•	A policy-to-please syndrome, to coin a phrase, emerged when analysts pressured intelligence consumers to modify policies in response to estimates. (Wirtz, 1991)
	•	the intelligence-to-please syndrome influenced estimates of enemy strength, especially those produced by officers working as analysts. Personal and institutional considerations apparently influenced the decisions made by middle-level officers to shape the reports produced by junior analysts in a way that supported the policies adopted by the American military. (Wirtz, 1991)
Intelligence broker
	•	Clearly the ‘intelligence brokers’ need to be really conversant with the potential of their agency to deliver value-adding support, and to be sufficiently in touch with one another not to be irritating the customer with rivalrous calls for attention. (Omand, 2014)
Intelligence digest
	•	Summarized digests of intelligence have their uses too—a few moments to scan them and then it is possible to call up a single report that looks par- ticularly relevant. But too often such summaries become the bottom item in the in-tray, and once several pile up then the risk of something important being missed increases. (Omand, 2014)
Intelligence reform
	•	One perennial suggestion for reform is to get senior officials more involved in setting the agenda and priorities for intelligence and in checking on professional compliance, but efforts to do this have been generally unsuccessful. (Betts, 2007)
	•	Organizational innovations will not improve the role of intelligence in policy unless they flow from the decision-makers’ views of their own needs and unless they provide frequent practical benefits. (Betts, 2007)
	•	If they do not atrophy, most solutions proposed to obviate intelligence dysfunctions have two edges: in reducing one vulnerability they in- crease another. (Betts, 2007)
	•	Ideas for organization that seem to be logical improvements are sometimes promoted without considering empirical evidence about them. (Betts, 2007)
	•	Reform is not hopeless, but hopes placed in the solutions most often proposed—such as the following—should be limited. (Betts, 2007)
	•	Bureaucratic realities have frustrated other attempts to consolidate the intelligence structure. (Betts, 2007)
	•	Organizational solutions to intelligence failure are hampered by three basic problems. Most procedural reforms that address specific pathologies introduce or accent other pathologies; changes in analytic processes can never fully transcend the constraints of ambiguity and ambivalence; and more rationalized information systems cannot fully compensate for the predispositions, perceptual idiosyncrasies, and time constraints of political consumers. (Betts, 2007)
Procedural solutions
	•	procedural solutions often are two steps forward and one back; organizational fixes often cannot transcend the basic barriers. (Betts, 2007)
Intelligence product
	•	Most intelligence products, even NIEs, are never read by high-level policymakers. At best, they are used by second-level staffers as background material for briefing their seniors. Consumers want previously coordinated analyses in order to save time and effort. (Betts, 2007)
	•	Intelligence organizations continue to insist upon written prose and formal briefing as the “gold standard” for disseminating information even though adults rarely retain more than ten percent of what they are “told” either orally or in written form. Instead, more experiential, interactive formats, as discussed at the workshops, might better capture the attention and imagination of intended audiences and strengthen retention of insights. (Fishbein and Treverton, 2004)
	•	If intelligence exists to serve policy, then intelligence products provided to decisionmakers must contain hard-hitting, focused analysis relevant to current policy issues. (Stack, 1997)
	•	Sherman Kent, in Strategic Intelligence for American World Policy, his path-breaking effort to join intelligence doctrine and practice for post World War II America, concluded that: There is no phase of the intelligence business which is more important than the proper relationship between intelligence itself and the people who use its products. (Davis, 1995)
	•	It is important that analytical products lay out the facts, the evidence, and the analysis rather than simply stating conclusions or analytical judgements. (Davis, 1996)
	•	I believe that most of you would agree that policymakers should be able to request intelligence products that address the issues they are dealing with on a daily basis. Such tasking is an integral part of the intelligence process. If we ignore policymaker interests, then our products become irrelevant in the formulation of our government's foreign policies. (Gates, 1992)
	•	In editing and revising intelligence products, I expect managers to explain their changes in face-to-face exchanges with their analysts and to be willing to admit when a revision is unwarranted. In turn, I expect analysts to use evidence and logic when arguing against proposed revisions in substance, to be open to new approaches and ideas, and to guard against purely defensive reactions. Expertise is a requirement, but analysts must not become so wedded to their views that they exclude well-grounded, alternative arguments. (Gates, 1992)
	•	Avoiding the opposing pitfalls of corruption and irrelevance takes the analytical process to the thin line between managerial responsibility and political manipulation. Intelligence products are supposed to represent the best judgments of whole organizations, not single authors. (Betts, 2007)

Intelligence consumers
	•	The intertwining of analysis and decision and the record of intelligence failures due to mistaken preconceptions and unexamined assumptions suggest the need to reform the attitudes, awareness, and modes of perception of intelligence consumers. (Betts, 2007)
	•	Intelligence consumers are political animals who have risen by being more decisive than reflective, more aggressive than introspective, and confident as much as cautious. (Betts, 2007)
	•	Intelligence consumers are political animals who have risen by being more decisive than reflective, more aggressive than introspective, and confident as much as cautious. (Betts, 2007)
	•	the line between perception and judgment is very thin, and consumers cannot carefully scrutinize, compare, and evaluate the methodologies of competing analyses for the same prosaic reason (the problem of expertise aside) that impedes many proposed reforms. (Betts, 2007)
	•	Although failures occur more often at the consuming than the pro- ducing end of intelligence, it is impractical to place the burden for correcting those faults on the consumers. (Betts, 2007)
	•	Consumers, nevertheless, are every bit as theoretical as anyone else even if they don’t realize it, since they make assumptions all the time about how patterns of experience demonstrate general propositions about the way the world works. (Betts, 2007)
	•	Customer demand for interpretive analysis is greatest within two or three days after an event occurs. The system requires the intelligence analyst to come up with an almost instant diagnosis before sufficient hard information, and the broader background information that may be needed to gain perspective, become available to make possible a well-grounded judgment. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	The ‘customer centric’ doctrine borrowed from the commercial world has the great merit of emphasizing the need to delight the customer with prompt service (delight being of course an ironical term when the news is bad), and to provide material that adds value, as well as being prepared to listen carefully to customer feedback. (Omand, 2014)
	•	‘Customer’ also carries a connotation of personalized service, taking account of specific needs, and that is certainly what is needed for example in terms of the service required by a field com- mander in a military theatre such as Afghanistan. (Omand, 2014)
	•	A possible danger in the commercial analogy is that it implies that ‘the customer is king’ and thus that the provider of intelligence is sup- plying what the customer wants—which in terms of content runs the risk of perceptions of politicization through delighting the ‘customers’ by telling them what they want to hear, not what they need to hear. (Omand, 2014)
	•	The term ‘consumer’, even more than customer, implies a financial transaction with a supplier, buying a product or service for personal use. Charging consumers for intelligence is a subject that Finance Ministries like to examine every few years on the (superficially reasonable) grounds that a free-at-point-of-consumption service will always gener- ate an excess demand beyond the point of economic efficiency which a market-based solution would have established. (Omand, 2014)
	•	It is difficult to over-estimate the importance of clarity about probability in conveying intelligence to customers, especially to decision-takers. Governments must not mistake possible for probable and probable for certain. Somehow, the language of the report or assessment must convey a proper sense of the strength of commitment to the key judgments of an assessment or the main conclusions of a single-source report. (Omand, 2014)
	•	Because the purpose of intelligence is to serve policy, there is general agreement in principle that the consumers of it should determine requirements and priorities for getting it and that the producers should respond. (Betts, 2007)
	•	When consumers abdicate, intelligence managers try to provide policy-relevant guidance themselves. (Betts, 2007)
	•	Intelligence analysts "would rather use words than numbers to describe how confident we are in our analysis," a senior CIA officer who's served for more than 20 years told me. Moreover, "most consumers of intelligence aren't particularly sophisticated when it comes to probabilistic analysis. They like words and pictures, too. My experience is that [they] prefer briefings that don't center on numerical calculation. That's not to say we can't do it, but there's really not that much demand for it." (Schrage, 2005)
	•	Consumers want answers; producers, however, can often contribute most by posing questions. (Hopple, 1984)

Consumer-driven process
	•	A consumer-driven process should maximize relevance and minimize wasted or misdirected effort. What is agreed in principle, however, is problematic in practice. (Betts, 2007)
	•	a true “consumer driven” intelligence process has never fully evolved within the NSC, re- gardless of the administration in office. (Betts, 2007)

Intelligence system
	•	the intelligence system can avert policy failure by presenting relevant and undisputed facts to nonexpert principals who might otherwise make decisions in ignorance. (Betts, 2007)
Intelligence business
	•	It is in the nature of the intelligence business that most of the attention is given to the risk management of potential threats and hazards rather than the opportunities that intelligence may indicate could be exploited. Insufficient attention is given in the literature to the value added by intelligence on how to capitalize on a situation. (Omand, 2014)
Intelligence bureaucratie
	•	intelligence bureaucracies are not naturally inclined to deal with theories in a conscious, rigorous, or sustained manner. (Betts, 2007)
Warning intelligence
	•	Warning intelligence is supposed to alert policy officials to ‘breaking’world situations, especially those for which they may have to take action. (Hulnick, 2006)
Operational intelligence
	•	Operational intelligence for offensive purposes includes information that will assist operators to “exploit vulnerabilities within terrorist groups, weaken terrorist groups’ infrastructures so that they will be unable to carry out plans, work closely with friendly foreign security and intelligence services around the world, ...and pursue major terrorists overseas and help the FBI render them to justice.” (Marrin, 2002)
	•	Operational intelligence can also have defensive purposes such as force protection. (Marrin, 2002)
Secret intelligence
	•	The world of secret intelligence amongst nations is no longer a zero-sum game.(Omand, 2014)
Strategic intelligence
	•	Strategic intelligence production “assesses the capabilities and intentions of key terrorist groups worldwide: their organization, infrastructure, leadership, support and financial networks, weapons acquisitions, capabilities, and operational intent to attack US facilities and personnel.” (Marrin, 2002)
	•	To produce the best strategic intelligence requires people who are imaginative in their hypotheses but also able to identify and adjust for their own analytical preconceptions and prejudices. (George, 2004)
Strategic-level intelligence agencies
	•	Only through these types of estimates can strategic-level intelligence agencies properly "serve" the policymakers. (Stack, 1997)
Strategic intelligence assessment
	•	a strategic intelligence assessment is a justified set of judgments about the course of events, informed by having reached the best possible explanation of the underlying motives and circumstances of the individuals and organizations being observed, informed by a real understanding of their past behaviour. (Omand, 2014)
	•	It cannot represent more than the best explanation of the situation consistent with what is known at that moment, and may need revision as new intelligence comes to notice. (Omand, 2014)
	•	The duty of government on receipt of such an assessment is to evaluate the implications for national interests in the light of these intelligence judgments and other informa- tion available. (Omand, 2014)
Intelligence problem
	•	Intelligence problems in the transnational realm are, however, generally less bounded than are those in the state-to- state realm. Transnational groups, like terrorist cells or proliferation networks, are likely to be smaller and more numerous than states, less constrained by rules and historic precedent, and more affected by tactical and situational circumstances as opposed to deeper internal drivers. They are thus more difficult to understand than state actors and more capable of engaging in a wide array of unpredictable behaviors. (Fishbein and Treverton, 2004)
Intelligence process
	•	I believe that most of you would agree that policymakers should be able to request intelligence products that address the issues they are dealing with on a daily basis. Such tasking is an integral part of the intelligence process. If we ignore policymaker interests, then our products become irrelevant in the formulation of our government's foreign policies. (Gates, 1992)
Perfect intelligence
	•	there is no such thing as perfect intelligence — deception, lack of collection assets, cultural biases, and myriad other factors can taint the process prior to analysis ever occurring. It doesn't matter how many different groups or agencies are studying an issue — lack of a complete picture is normally caused by missing pieces of information or timeline pressures which force action after only limited information is available and not because of a lack of competitive analysis. (Stack, 1997)
Intelligence report
Important intelligence report
	•	Important intelligence reports will go directly from the collecting agency to the relevant set of customers, including political leaders. (Omand, 2014)
Informal intelligence report
	•	Informal intelligence reports circumvent the established checks and balances within the intelligence system and raise issues of control, accountability and authenticity. (Wark, 2013)
Intelligence software
	•	The process of information collection is made difficult because considerable technical facility is often needed to use the search tools. The various software tools sometimes talk to one another, and sometimes do not. Analysts report that they generally find it difficult to synthesise different data types and databases. (Hoffman et al., 2011)
	•	Decision support systems often trigger automation surprises, in that the software generates results that are not transparent to the analyst, and thereby spawn trust issues.(Hoffman et al., 2011)
	•	Experience shows that the new software tools often do not tie sufficiently (or at all) to the actual work requirements of analysts (McGroddy and Lin 2004, see also Hoffman and Elm 2006). Worse still, tools can actually impede intelligence analysis. (Hoffman et al., 2011)
	•	In studies conducted by ourselves and our colleagues we have seen many instances where: tool use is labour intensive with no obvious value-added, e.g. high cognitive effort in building argument templates for specific problem sets, confusion about, gaming of or outright disregard for fusion algorithms (which are intended to support deductive reasoning), uncertainty and mistrust concerning the equations that are ‘riding under the hood’, and that magically generate conclusions (in the form of yet more probability numbers), lack of standards of judgment for answering and/or scoring questions within the structured arguments, disruptions and impediments to collective problem solving, a focus on one person-one machine contexts of work leads to underspecification of collaborative processes, inappropriate requirements for low-level judgments within the ‘zone of indiffer- ence’ – i.e. requiring analysts to make precise, numeric judgments that otherwise could ‘go either way’, discomfort with the inflexibility of argument structures or templates. (Hoffman et al., 2011)
Intelligence source
Open source intelligence
	•	Open source information may be as valuable as secret sources in proving context within which to assess intentions. (Omand, 2014)
	•	In modern times, open source information has become more important, such as from the BBC Monitoring Service and other media reporting of developments. (Omand, 2014)
	•	OSINT has risen in credibility and influence over the last few years. According to Denis A. Clift, "Open source intelligence plays a significant role in finished intelligence production both in its own right and in conjunction with information from other sources. It has proven essential to intelligence analysis and operations." (Stack, 1997)
	•	OSINT has one advantage over the other sources: its exposure to millions of pairs of eyeballs. (Steele, 2007)
	•	OSINT also offers analytical frames of reference that have stood the test of time. (Steele, 2007)
	•	OSINT is a continuous process of collection, processing, analysis, sharing, feedback, and expansion. (Steele, 2007)
	•	At root, OSINT is about smart people creating smart organizations by sharing the burden of conceptualizing requirements, collectiong all information in all languages all the time, doing multi-cultural inter-agency analysis, and then producing credible reliable intelligence that is actionable – it is useful and it leads to constructive outcomes. (Steele, 2007)
	•	OSINT crosses all boundaries, and in so doing, brings us all closer together and helps us to both understand and to address common problems at every level of community and governance. (Steele, 2007)
	•	OSINT saves lives, time, and money. (Steele, 2007)
	•	OSINT is information that has been deliberately discovered, discriminated, distilled, and disseminated to a select audience, generally the commander and their immediate staff, in order to address a specific question. (Steele, 2007)
	•	OSINT, in other words, applies the proven process of intelligence to the broad diversity of open sources of information, and creates intelligence. (Steele, 2007)
	•	While OSINT is not “new” in that nations and organizations have always understood the value of legal travellers, direct observation, structured reading, and legal purchases of information services, what is new about OSINT is that confluence of three distinct trends: first, the proliferation of the Internet as a tool for disseminating and sharing overt information in all languages; second, the consequent and related “information explosion” in which published useful knowledge is growing exponentially; and third, the collapse of formerly denied areas accompanied by the explosion of non-traditional threats in the form of failed states and transnational non-state threats to public security and prosperity. (Steele, 2007)
	•	OSINT is distinct from academic, business, or journalistic research in that it represents the application of the proven process of national intelligence to the diversity of sources, with the intent of producing tailored intelligence for the commander. (Steele, 2007)
	•	OSINT is also unique, within a collation operations context, in that it simultaneously provides a multi-lateral foundation for establishing a common view of the shared Area of Operation (AOR), while also providing a context within which a wide variety of bi-lateral classified intelligence sharing arrangements can be exploited. (Steele, 2007)
	•	OSINT is not a substitute for satellites, spies, or existing organic military and civilian intelligence capabilities. It is, however, a foundation – a very strong foundation – for planning and executing coalition operations across the spectrum from humanitarian assistance to total war. (Steele, 2007)
	•	OSINT provides strategic historical and cultural insights; it provides operationally helpful information about infrastructure and current conditions; and it provides tactically vital commercial geospatial information that is not available from national capabilities. (Steele, 2007)
	•	In coalialition operations, OSINT is both the foundation for civil-military cooperation, and the framework for classified bilateral intelligence-sharing. (Steele, 2007)
	•	OSINT is an essential building block for all intelligence disciplines. (Steele, 2007)
	•	Open sources have always played a role in classified intelligence production. In the NATO context, a robust OSINT capability greatly increases the range of information sources available to intelligence staffs to address intelligence needs. (Steele, 2007)
	•	OSINT is able to complement an all-source intelligence production process with essential support including tip-offs, context, validation and cover for information sanitation. (Steele, 2007)
	•	Open-Source intelligence (OSINT) is publicly available information appearing in print or electronic form. (Phythian, 2013)
Validated open source intelligence
	•	OSINT-V is OSINT to which a very high degree of certainty can be attributed. It can be produced by an all-source intelligence professional, with access to classified intelligence sources, whether working for a nation or for a coalition staff. It can also come from an assured open source to which no question can be raised concerning its vaility (images of an aircraft arriving at an airport that are broadcast over the media). (Steele, 2007)
Signals intelligence
	•	Signals intelligence (SIGINT) is derived from signals intercepts comprising, however transmitted – either individually or in combination, all communication intelligence (COMINT), electronic intelligence (ELINT), or foreign instrumentation signals intelligence (FISINT). (Phythian, 2013)
Imagery intelligence
	•	Imagery intelligence (IMINT) includes representations of objects reproduced electronically or by optical means on film, electronic display devices, or other media. Imagery can be dereived from visual photography, radar sensors, infrared sensors, lasers, and electro-optics. (Phythian, 2013)
Measurement and signature intelligence
	•	Measurement and signature intelligence (MASINT) is technically derived intelligence data other than imagery and SIGINT. The data results in intelligence that locates, identifies, or describes distinctive characteristics of targets. It employs a broad group of disciplines including nuclear, optical, radio frequency, acoustics, seismic, and materials sciences. (Phythian, 2013)
Human intelligence
	•	Human intelligence (HUMINT) is derived from human sources. Collection includes clandestine acquisition of photography, documents, and other material; overt collection by personnel in diplomatic and consular posts; debriefing of foreign nationals and US citizens who travel abroad; and official contacts with foreign governments. (Phythian, 2013)
Geospatial intelligence 
	•	Geospatial intelligence (GEOINT) is the analysis and visual representation of security-related ativities on the earth. It is produced through an integration of imagery, imagery intelligence, and geospatial information. (Phythian, 2013)

Intelligence community 
	•	ambivalence; and more rationalized information systems cannot fully compensate for the predispositions, perceptual idiosyncrasies, and time constraints of political consumers. (Betts, 2007)
	•	The Intelligence Community provides many different kinds of finished intelligence analysis in formats driven by the needs of its varied consumers. (Marrin, 2002)
	•	The Intelligence Community has instituted a number of structural and procedural changes – and intelligence authors have suggested even more--to decrease the distance between analysts and policymakers. The IC is already assigning a small number of senior analysts to policymaker staffs, detailing analysts to help with a particular issue such as a treaty negotiation, and providing analytic “liasons” to entire institutions to serve as focal points for intelligence support. (Marrin, 2002)
	•	Because decisionmakers do not have the time nor analytical staff to study these issues and prepare reports, they must rely on intelligence community expertise. (Stack, 1997)
	•	Policymakers need abbreviated, focused analytical products from the intelligence community. Even with the lengthier estimates, the intelligence community should affirm to policymakers the most likely course of events after processing and evaluating the available evidence. (Stack, 1997)
	•	If the Intelligence Community is to help policymakers make the best-informed decisions possible. then analysts must bring something to the party in short, they need to be seen as credible sources of needed expertise. (Petersen, 2003)
	•	Policymakers often complain that the intelligence community does not give them the type of information they need, but they have trouble giving meaningful guidance for collection and analysis. (Betts, 2007)
	•	In most instances, policymakers want analysis that gives them the consensus, or the best single estimate, of the intelligence community. (Betts, 2007)
	•	The organizational pluralism of the in- telligence community is the best defense against deceptive and damag- ing politicization, and that defense may best be provided by unmasking and setting up a competition between predispositions, rather than let- ting biases sneak into products striving for ideal objectivity. (Betts, 2007)
	•	America's intelligence community doesn't like odds. Yet the simplest and most cost-effective innovation that community could adopt would be to embrace them. (Schrage, 2005)
	•	The Intelligence Community (IC) has developed many devices to attack the problem of unexpected surprises, including the use of ‘‘red teams’’ to attack the assumptions underlying conventional analysis. (Weiss, 2008)
	•	The intelligence community has limited resources and a large mission; it must put priorities on the kind of intelligence it collects, analyzes, and disseminates to policymakers. (Rover, 2005)
	•	The intelligence community is far from perfect. It suffers froma number of bureaucratic pathologies that are common to many large organizations. It is also capable of serious errors, and there are a number of practical reforms that can improve performance. (Rover, 2005)
Intelligence community leader
	•	It is important, therefore, for the leaders of the intelligence com- munity to be at ease within the policy community, and to understand how things get done within it, yet retain their independence of judgment. (Omand, 2014)
Military intelligence
	•	Military intelligence inclines toward worst-case analysis in planning and toward best-case analysis in operational evaluation. (Betts, 2007)

Intelligence cycle
	•	The traditional concept of an intelligence cycle assumes a sequence in which (1) policymakers determine what information they need, and intelligence managers translate these needs into requirements for collection; (2) “tasking” assigns collectors responsibility for seeking the needed data; (3) collectors collect and report the raw data; (4) analysts assess the data in the context of other information and their own broader expertise; (5) “production” converts the analysis into finished reports; (6) products are disseminated to consumers; and (7) the consumers make a policy decision and levy another round of requirements. (Betts, 2007)
	•	Decisionmakers usually have little knowledge of the entire intelligence cycle, especially those functions which occur behind the scenes — collection, exploitation, processing, and interpretation/evaluation of the raw information.  (Stack, 1997)
	•	In the modern era, almost all intelligence professionals will study the Intelligence Cycle as a kind of gospel of how intelligence functions. (Hulnick, 2006)
	•	Yet it is not a particularly good model, since the cyclical pattern does not describe what really happens. Policy officials rarely give collection guidance. Collection and analysis, which are supposed to work intandem, in fact work more properly in parallel. Finally, the idea thatdecision makers wait for the delivery of intelligence before making policy decisions is equally incorrect. In the modern era, policy officials seem to want intelligence to support policy rather than to inform it. The Intelligence Cycle also fails to consider either counter-intelligence or covert action. Taken as a whole, the cycle concept is a flawed model, but nevertheless continues to be taught in the US and around the world. (Hulnick, 2006)
	•	Most are concerned with exploring the intelligence cycle: setting intelligence requirements, collecting data, analysing data, and disseminating finished intelligence. (Wirtz, 2007)
	•	Alexander George, for example, has suggested that intelligence failure can occur at any point in the intelligence cycke, if intelligence professionals and policymakers fail ot answer any one of six questions: (1) identifying the adversary (who?); (2) estimating the probability of attack (whether?); (3) determining the type of action involved (what?); (4) determining the location of the attack (where?); (5) estimating the timing of the action (when?); (6) determining the motivation behind the initiative (why?). (Wirtz, 2007)
	•	The concept of Intelligence Cycle presents something of a paradox. On the one hand, it has been central to the study and understanding of intelligence in the post-Second WOrl War era. An intelligence training course, higher education course, or textbook that did not open with a description of the Intelligence Cycle would have seemed unthinkable until quite recently, akin to studying Politics without considering the nature and role of the state. As Robert Clark has noted: “Over the years, the intelligence cycle has bcome almost a theological concept: No one questions its validity.” On the other hand, the Intelligence Cycle has never been a particularly accurate guide to the way in which contemporary intelligence is organise and proceeds. (Phythian, 2013)
	•	The entire cucle begins with the planning and direction stage, in which the customers for the intelligence product – policy-makers in the case of national security intelligence – request intelligence on a particular issue or specific target. Once directed by the customer, the second stage of the cycle, collection, begins. This involves accessing the raw information that will be required for the finishe intelligence product to be produced. (Phythian, 2013)
	•	Warner argues that this wide acceptance of the Intelligence Cycle is, to a significant extent, an artefact of the linear notions of cognition and behaviour that prevailed in the social sciences seventy or more years ago. The nature of the contemporary world means that it is time for the Intelligence Cycle to be re-evaluated in the light of more recent discussions of the social construction of knowledge and risk, as well as the advent of automated decision processes in which cognitive steps occur at machine speeds. (Phythian, 2013)
	•	Peter Gill and Mark Phythian take an innovative approach to explaining the limiations of the Intelligence Cyle model in the context of what they term the “challenges of complexity”. They identify seven specific challenges: the challenge of understanding intelligence via a risk-based approach; the challenge of bureaucratic politics; the challenge of interactivity; the challenge of comparatice analysis; the challenge of (covert) action; the challenge of technology; and the challenge of oversight. On the basis of their analysis of theses challenges, Gill and Phythian propose an alternative way of conceptualising the intelligence process that involves moving away from the notion of a cycle towards the more complex notion of a web of intelligence. (Phythian, 2013)
	•	The cycle has five phases: planning and direction, collection, processing, production and analysis, and dissemination. (Johnson, 1986)
Open source intelligence cycle
	•	The open source intelligence cycle consists of the following steps that can be summarized by remembering “the four D’s” of Discovery (Know Who Knows); Discrimination (Know What’s What); Distillation (Know What’s Hot); and Dissemination (Know Who’s Who). (Steele, 2007)
	•	The OSINT intelligence cycle cannot make up for pathological mind-sets (including ideological fantasy and political corruption) or poor management. (Steele, 2007)
Intelligence services
	•	Preventing surprise through warning of adverse eventsis a core task and concern of intelligence services. (Frühling, 2014)
	•	The goal is to deter and limit damage by identifying in advance when, where, and how a declared or potentialadversary will forcefully strike’. (Frühling, 2014)
Intelligent individuals
	•	Highly intelligent individuals need less effort to solve the same problems (Kahneman, 2012)
Intelligence sense-making
	•	intelligence sense-making offers a way to comprehend those complex transnational threats whose speed, uncertainty, and interactivity defy traditional analytic approaches. (Fishbein and Treverton, 2004)
	•	The following principles can guide the development of an alternative process for intelligence sense-making. Such a process must be: Continual, Creative, Collaborative, Counter-intuitive, Consumer-friendly. (Fishbein and Treverton, 2004)
Objective intelligence
	•	The challenge for us as analysts, then, is to produce intelligence that objectively assesses relevant policy issues—whether it supports or undermines current policy trends—and to ensure that our product is read and valued by the policymakers concerned. Ensuring objectivity means that we explore the issue fully, looking at and vetting all the available  evidence and identifying where gaps, blindspots, or alternative scenarios exist. (Gates, 1992)
Intelligence studies
	•	in the absence of a normative theory for how intelligence analysis should be optimally done, scholars lack criteria to distinguish between unprofessional mistakes and inherent difficulties that lead to intelligence failure. (Honig, 2007)
	•	The study of intelligence analysis is a relatively new field. While spying is an old art, and the exploitation and analysis of the spy’s information has always been a part of the business, few practitioners have concentrated their attention on how best to organize analysis for the best possible results. (George, 2004)
Orthodox School
	•	argues that the inherent pathologies and obstacles in the work of intelligence make every attempt of surprise attack an almost certain success. (Honig, 2007)
	•	The Orthodox School asserts that surprise attacks are inevitable due to the inherent limits of the intelligence process. (Honig, 2007)
	•	The Orthodox School argues that surprise is almost certain, even in caseswhere ample warning information is available, or, in Betts’s words, surprise occurs ‘‘despite warning.’’ (Honig, 2007)
	•	The Orthodox School asserts that intelligence failures are not the product of analysts’ negligence or stupidity, but rather the result of inherent cognitive biases that affect ‘‘honest, dedicated and intelligent men.’’ It emphasizes that the cognitive shortcuts people employ to cope with the volume of the information they are bombarded with—much of it contradictory and ambiguous—inevitably lead to mistakes in judgment. Since these biases are inherent in human nature, they affect all intelligence analysts and are unlikely to be fixed. (Honig, 2007)
	•	The Orthodox School argues that the analysts’ level of professionalism cannot make a big difference. (Honig, 2007)
	•	These Orthodox scholars suggest instead that error is inherent in estimation rather than the analyst’s responsibility. (Honig, 2007)
	•	The Orthodox School argues that no amount of procedural or organizational tinkering will eliminate errors associated with normal human psychology and organizational life. Hence, any remedial action will be palliative at best. Therefore, military planners should not plan on intelligence warning, but must plan for survival despite error. (Honig, 2007)
	•	The Orthodox School points to the uncertain and ambiguous environment which is exacerbated by the screens of deception. (Honig, 2007)
	•	The Orthodox argument is that warning of an attack is difficult since it means predicting the likelihood of a single event that breaks sharply with recent past.
	•	 (Honig, 2007)
	•	Orthodox scholars conclude that since the job of intelligence is to minimize uncertainty, the analyst is faced with a mission impossible. (Honig, 2007)
	•	Orthodox scholars claim that signals come embedded in a network of contradictory signs, called noise. Noise consists of signs that point in the wrong direction and obscure the signals that point in the right way. (Honig, 2007)
	•	Orthodox scholars point to the cognitive shortcuts people use as the primary obstacle for a correct analysis. (Honig, 2007)
	•	Orthodox scholars note that organizational culture inspires in intelligence analysts a tendency for common perceptions. (Honig, 2007)
	•	failures usually happen because intelligence agencies and analysts fail to understand signals and warnings that were right in front of them all the time. (Dahl, 2013)
	•	The traditional school provides reassurance for intelligence professionals, because it argues that intelligence failures are largely inevitable, resulting from the natural limitations of human cognition. But this view is pessimistic about the prospects for preventing future surprise attacks. (Dahl, 2013)
Revisionist School
	•	asserts that the roots of surprise attacks lie in avoidable failures of certain intelligence people. (Honig, 2007)
	•	The Revisionist School is much more optimistic and stresses that intelligence failure is a result of avoidable mistakes that lead to a preventable outcome. Hence, intelligence failures are not inevitable; they are the result of specific malfunctions that can be remedied and are not insurmountable obstacles. Therefore, analysts are not helpless and innocent victims facing an unforeseen ‘‘natural disaster. (Honig, 2007)
	•	The Revisionist School challenges this conclusion, asserting that the lack of ‘‘good warnings’’—and not other obstacles—hinders the capacity to predict. Hence, the revisionists argue that the problem is the insufficiency of intelligence-gathering efforts and not the limitations of analysis. (Honig, 2007)
	•	Revisionists claim that the impact of cognitive heuristics is not always bad, and argue that the human mind functions overall rather well. They show how certain cognitive phenomena can overcome the obstacles caused by heuristics, and how different cognitive phenomena may even assist analysts. (Honig, 2007)
	•	Instead of concentrating on cognitive factors, revisionists point to individual-specific problematic behavior as the cause of failure. They assert that the staffing of analysis teams is a crucial factor since the strongest defense comes from ‘‘good sense, good character and good mental habits of senior officials.’’ (Honig, 2007)
	•	the Revisionist School regards professionalism (i.e., integrity, experience, technical skills, etc.) as a crucial factor, which can be attained through training, and argues that Orthodox scholars have underestimated the tools and skills available to the professional intelligence analysts. (Honig, 2007)
	•	The Revisionists argue that the most important factors that lead to intelligence failures are those that can be fixed. Hence, they call for reforms to improve the intelligence process and methodology,24 and for recruiting people with the right qualifications. (Honig, 2007)
	•	The Revisionist claim that all obstacles are surmountable seems equally untenable. (Honig, 2007)
	•	Revisionist scholars hold that a close scrutiny of some cases of surprise attack shows that a plenitude of unambiguous tactical indicators made the enemy’s offensive intentions abundantly clear. (Honig, 2007)
	•	the Revisionists respond that the senior analysts’ search for certainty, while working in an uncertain and ambiguous environment, is precisely what too often misleads the top echelons to make a faulty risk-assessment. Hence, they argue that professional intelligence analysts must clearly distinguish between estimates and ‘‘facts’’ based on hard evidence in order to produce better intelligence. (Honig, 2007)
	•	Revisionists point out that the cognitive shortcuts are not unavoidable. They note, for instance, that more recent psychological research has shown that schemas do change when no other way to account for contradictory data that people consider highly diagnostic is available. (Honig, 2007)
	•	Among scholars and analysts who have studied intelligence failure and surprise attack, there is a second broad school, whose members are more critical of the intelligence community but more optimistic about the future than the traditionalists. They tend to believe that the fundamental problems for intelligence lie more in terms of organizational and bureaucratic limitations than analytic or psychological ones, and many of them think that organizational reforms can significantly improve the performance of the intelligence community. These thinkers are fewer in number than the traditionalists, but the reform impulse has been seen prominently in the work of a number of blue ribbon panels and commissions that have studied the US intelligence community in the past half century. (Dahl, 2013)
	•	For reformist thinkers, the fundamental problem underlying the inability of the intelligence community to share and process information properly lies at the level of structure and organization. (Dahl, 2013)
	•	Reformist thinkers, conversely, provide less comfort for the intelligence community, which they argue is often guilty of avoidable mistakes and even incompetence. But their view is reassuring to the public because it suggests that if we can fix the problems that produce intelligence failure, the American intelligence community will be more likely to connect the dots next time and prevent a future terrorist (or perhaps even conventional) attack. (Dahl, 2013)
Contrarian school
	•	The contrarian school, conversely, holds a very different view of the reasons for intelligence failure, but it ultimately offers little hope for significant improvement. (Dahl, 2013)

Idealist school
	•	The ‘Sherman Kent’ or ‘idealist’ approach is modelled on professional objectivity. Thus, for example, the medical, statistical or military professions would be expected to give objective advice to government based on a set of professional ethics that put objectivity and freedom from outside pressure as cardinal virtues. A clear dividing wall could therefore be drawn round the professional advisers separating them from the political arena in which the users of such advice circulate. Intelligence is collected on potential threats identified by the intelligence community itself, and its assessments are then to be tossed over the wall, in the hope that they will be picked up and acted upon. (Omand, 2014)
	•	This ‘push’ model is an idealization, and perhaps for that reason much beloved by academics: ‘the only hope for improving the quality and reliability of the intelligence community ... lies in distancing it from the political arena’. (Omand, 2014)
	•	In both ‘idealist’ and ‘realist’ models, there has to be some process of direction of the intelligence community towards priority targets. It is also necessary then to establish which agencies and what techniques are likely best to be able to deliver against those requirements. (Omand, 2014)
	•	The Kent model derives from Sherman Kent, the legendary Yale historian who wrote the first major postwar treatise on intelligence and headed the Office of National Estimates in its formative years. Kent warned about the danger of letting intelligence personnel get too close to policymaking circles, lest their objectivity and integrity be compromised. The view that objectivity takes precedence over everything dominated the culture of the Central Intelligence Agency (although not of all other intelligence organizations in the cabinet) for at least its first three decades. (Betts, 2007)
	•	Traditionally, liberal policymakers have suspected analysts in the intelligence agencies of the military services and the Defense Intelligence Agency of hawkish predispositions. Conservative policymakers have suspected analysts in CIA and the State Department’s Bureau of Intelligence and Research (INR) of dovish inclinations. These images highlight a problem for the Kent model because unacknowledged prejudices allow the autonomy of analysts to foster politicization in the name of objectivity, and enable them “to pass off opinions as facts.” (Betts, 2007)

Realist school
	•	The ‘Robert Gates’ or ‘realist’ approach starts from the other end of the process, seeing the intelligence community as essential partners in the day-to-day business of government, providing added value through improving the quality of decision-making. Intelligence is in that view a service industry. How is the intelligence community to know where it can add value, or by when its National Intelligence Estimates and JIC assessments would need to be available, if it does not have a close relationship with the policy-makers really to understand their objectives and everyday needs? This is what we might call a ‘realist’ approach. (Omand, 2014)
	•	Intelligence is thus seen to have a vital role to play in the formulation of policy, and in the maintenance of a supportive public opinion. Pol- icy-makers accordingly need to ‘pull’ intelligence by suggesting to the agencies what targets to concentrate on, what are the timelines for key decisions and where the greatest value-added from secret intelligence would be in order that intelligence serve the policy-makers’ require- ments. (Omand, 2014)
	•	In both ‘idealist’ and ‘realist’ models, there has to be some process of direction of the intelligence community towards priority targets. It is also necessary then to establish which agencies and what techniques are likely best to be able to deliver against those requirements. (Omand, 2014)
	•	The Gates model—after Robert Gates who, long before he became secretary of defense, was deputy director for intelligence at the Cen- tral Intelligence Agency in the Reagan administration and DCI in the administration of Bush the Elder—arose from critiques of ineffective intelligence contributions to policymaking and from the view that utility is the sine qua non. (Betts, 2007)
	•	The Gates model emerged in the 1980s and was ascendant until 2003.24 Its partisans saw the earlier orthodoxy as a prescription for ir- relevance and their own approach as contextualization, or as the realistic management of policymakers’ cluttered radar screens. (Betts, 2007)
	•	Adherents to the Kent model see the Gates approach as a prescription for politicization in the prevalent, pejorative sense. (Full disclosure: I have always leaned, with ambivalence, toward the Gates model. (Betts, 2007)
	•	According to Gates, “We must draw a line• Between producing a corporate product and suppressing different views; • Between adjusting stylistic presentation to anticipate your consumer’s predilections and changing the analysis to pander to them. . . . • Between viewing reporting critically and using evidence selectively.” (Betts, 2007)
International politics
	•	In international politics, furthermore, deception is rampant. Adversaries usually wish to mislead others about at least some aspect of what they can and will do. (Beebe and Pherson, 2012)
International relations
Sociology of international relations
	•	This term is understood to mean the study of institutional structures charac- teristic of contemporary nations, with special regard to their problems of mutual assimila- tion and adjustment and to possibilities of their integration into socio-cultural regions and the international society as a whole. (Callis, 1947)
Intelink
	•	Intelink – described as the Intelligence Community’s classified worldwide intranet--is for most CIA analysts a multimedia supplement to CIRAS. It is based on the same technology of the Internet, and can provide links to related documents and raw imagery. Published reports suggest Intelink has received greater use since September 11th 2001. (Marrin, 2002)
Intent
Political intent
	•	objectives to be achieved. (Betts, 2007)
Intention
	•	capabilities take time to build up but intentions can change overnight. (Omand, 2014)
	•	intentions can change overnight and are in the nature of mysteries to be divined.  (Omand, 2014)
	•	There is almost always an emotion behind any intention, and beyond their words, you are attuning yourself to what they want, their goals, which will also register physically in you if you pay attention. (Greene, 2018)
	•	If you are the object of sudden attention but it seems unreliable, they are probably intending to ask something of you, to use and manipulate you in some way. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Invariably in these cases people’s thinking is remarkably simple and lazy: kill Caesar and the Republic returns, action A leads to result B. A variation on this, one that is quite common in the modern world, is to believe that if people have good intentions, good things should be the result. If a politician is honest and means well, he or she will bring about the desired results. In fact, good intentions often lead to what are known as cobra effects, because people with the noblest intentions are often blinded by feelings of self-righteousness and do not consider the complex and often malevolent motivations of others. (Greene, 2018)
Intention gauging
	•	Intelligence analysts face difficulty in determining whether their predictions are accurate because the opportunity for validation through feedback (except long after the fact) is limited (Honig, 2007)
	•	This inability to judge the reasons behind the enemy’s actions obliges analysts to rely primarily, when possible, on the physical and verifiable indicators of tactical deployments in estimating enemy’s intentions. (Honig, 2007)
Intolerable risks
	•	In the case of intolerable risks – and often in the case of tolerable but highly disputed risks – risk managers should opt for prevention strategies as a means to replace the hazardous activity with another activity leading to identical or similar benefits. (Renn, 2007b)
	•	Ideally, we would seek to control intolerable risks until the residual risk is tolerable. (Newsome, 2013)
Interactiveness
	•	Interactiveness per se, though, is not a useful concept. (Perrow, 1999)
	•	One problem with the terms complex and linear is that the opposite of complex is "simple," and the opposite of linear is "nonlinear." (Perrow, 1999)
	•	systems are not linear or complex, strictly speaking, only their interactions are. (Perrow, 1999)
	•	Whether the interactions are complex or linear, they cannot be temporarily altered. (Perrow, 1999)
	•	Interactively complex and tightly coupled designs are created because they often allow greater functionality and efficiency to be achieved, but simpler, decoupled designs can usually achieve the same basic goals. (Marais et al., 2004)

Linear interactions
	•	These are "linear" interactions: production is carried out through a series or sequence of steps laid out in a line. It doesn't matter much whether there are 1,000 or 1,000,000 parts in the line. It is easy to spot the failure and we know what its effect will be on the adjacent stations. There will be product accumulating up- stream and incomplete product going out downstream of the failure point. Most of our planned life is organized that way. (Perrow, 1999)
	•	The much more common interactions, the kind we intuitively try to construct because of their simplicity and comprehensibility, I will call linear interactions. Linear interactions overwhelmingly predominate in all systems. But even the most linear of systems will have at least one source of complex interactions, the environment, since it impinges upon many parts or units in the system. (Perrow, 1999)
	•	Linear interactions are overwhelmingly those of an "expected production sequence" (Perrow, 1999) 
	•	Linear interactions are those interactions of one component in the DEPOSE system (Design, Equipment, Procedures, Operators, Supplies and materials, and Environment) with one or more components that precede or follow it immediately in the sequence of production. (Perrow, 1999)
	•	Linear interactions are those in expected and familiar production or maintenance sequence, and those that are quite visible even if unplanned. (Perrow, 1999)
	•	Linear systems also have interactions that are not visible, of course, but they occur within well-defined and segregated segments of the production or maintenance sequence. (Perrow, 1999)
	•	In a typical (linear) manufacturing plant both errors and interactions are more visible. (Perrow, 1999)

Complex interactions
	•	complex interactions, suggesting that there are branching paths, feedback loops, jumps from one linear sequence to another because of proximity. (Perrow, 1999)
	•	Complex interactions will generally be those not intended in the design. (Perrow, 1999)
	•	Thus, complex interactions may be unintended ones, or intended but unfamiliar ones. (Perrow, 1999)
	•	Complex interactions are those in which one. (Perrow, 1999) 
	•	Complex interactions are those of unfamiliar sequences, or unplanned and unexpected sequences, and either not visible or not immediately comprehensible. (Perrow, 1999)
	•	Systems with interactive complexity (cells 2 and 4) will produce unexpected interactions among multiple failures (Perrow, 1999)
	•	Interactive complexity is a measure, not a system’s overall size or the number of subunits that exist in it, but rather of the way in which parts are connected and interact. (Sagan, 1995)
	•	Organizations that display high interactive complexity can be either loose or tightly coupled (Sagan, 1995)
	•	Decentralization of decision-making authority to individuals close to the operations may well be necessary to produce appropriate low-level responses to unanticipated event in systems that display high degrees of interactive complexity (Sagan, 1995)
	•	high interactive complexity (which produces bizarre and unanticipated failures) (Sagan, 1995) 
	•	Interactive complexity refers to the presence of unfamiliar or unplanned and unexpected sequences of events in a system that are either not visible or not immediately comprehensible (Marais et al., 2004)
Interactome 
	•	Cells are a miniature cyberspace: genetic regulatory networks, protein interaction networks, and metabolic networks are nested into one another; for this reason, some scientists have proposed fusing the conceptso f genome, proteome, metabolome, etc. into the comprehensive idea of interactome. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
International environement
	•	Intelligence analysts face difficulty in determining whether their predictions are accurate because the opportunity for validation through feedback (except long after the fact) is limited. (Honig, 2007)
International relations
	•	International Relations is in constant need of new theoretical tools in order to cope with the dynamic nature of its object of study. (Griner, 2002)
	•	International Relations (IR) can significantly contribute to the study of world risk society because its cognitive relation with international and transnational phenomena is particularly close. (Griner, 2002)
	•	International relations became a subject of academic inquiry in the aftermath of the First World War and was animated by a desire to understand better, and so hopefully to avoid, inter-state conflict (Sheehan, 2005). (Grey, 2009)
International security
	•	‘International security’, Lawrence Freedman asserts, ‘addresses questions of force: how to spot it, stop it, resist it, and occasionally threaten and even use it’. (Rasmussen, 2001)
	•	International security is mostly about how human collectivities relate to each other in terms of threats and vulnerabilities, although sometimes it addresses the ways such collectivities relate tothreats from the natural environment.  (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	international security is more firmly rooted in the traditions of power politics. (Buzan et al., 1997)
Interpretation
Adversary interpretation
	•	One of the more difficult men- tal feats is to take a familiar body of data and reorganize it visually or mentally to perceive it from a different perspective. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	In order to understand international interactions, analysts must understand the situation as it appears to each of the opposing forces, and constantly shift back and forth from one perspective to the other as they try to fathom how each side interprets an ongoing series of interactions. (Heuer, 1999)
Natural interpretation
	•	Making the additional simplifying assumption, we can now distinguish between (a) sensations, and (b) those "mental operations which follow so closely upon the senses" 133 and are so firmly connected with their re- actions that a separation is difficult to achieve. Considering the origin and the effect of such operations, I shall call them natural interpretations. (Feyerabend, 1993)
Interregional dynamics
Low instance
	•	Difficult border cases between regions may be explained by noticing an insulator state, or a case of asymmetry where a neighbouring great power leans on a weaker neighbouring RSC. (Buzan and Wæver, 2003)
Strong instance
	•	Strong instances of interregional dynamics may be indicators of an external transformation (merger) of RSCs. (Buzan and Wæver, 2003)
Intuition
	•	I quoted Herbert Simon’s definition of intuition in the introduction, but it will make more sense when I repeat it now: “The situation has provided a cue; this cue has given the expert access to information stored in memory, and the information provides the answer. Intuition is nothing more and nothing less than recognition.” (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	‘intuition’ seems too vague a concept to use in organizations that are meant to be accountable. (Rosenberg, 2008)
	•	one should use intuition in order to determine the probability of the future event, but he does not conclude that the probability is only a subjective prediction. (Rosenberg, 2008)
In-Depth
	•	In general, the goal of doing a case study is to get in-depth understanding of something – a program, an event, a place, a person, an organization. Often the interest is in process – how things work and why – rather than variations in outcomes, in contexts rather than specific variables, in discovery rather than theory testing (Yin 2008) (Bernard and Ryan, 2010)
Indexical meaning
	•	[…] indexical meaning, which is defined by the context in which an expression is uttered. (Davies et al., 2002)
Imitation
	•	Imitation can be a powerful tool for spreading good ideas fast, and blogging helps them to spread faster than ever. (Coker, 2009)
	•	Intelligent imitation demands an initially wide array of options and information plus the willingness of some people to put their own judgement ahead of the group; this is the reason why leadership is important, especially in the military, whose best leaders still tend to emerge from the field. (Coker, 2009)
Improvement
	•	is simply doing the same thing better. (Royal Society of Chemistry, 2014)
Inclination
Primal inclination
	•	Normally the signs of our uniqueness are clearer to us in early childhood. We found ourselves naturally drawn to particular subjects or activities, despite the influence of our parents. We can call these primal inclinations. They speak to us, like a voice. But as we get older, that voice becomes drowned out by parents, peers, teachers, the culture at large. We are told what to like, what is cool, what is not cool. We start to lose a sense of who we are, what makes us different. We choose career paths unsuited to our nature. (Greene, 2018)
Indicator 
	•	By specifying in advance the threshold for what actions or events would be significant and might change their minds, analysts can avoid rationalizing new developments or events as “nothing new” or fitting them into an existing intellectual framework. Indicators can also be used to direct collection efforts and to help route relevant information to all interested parties. (Pherson, 2009)
Tactical indicators
	•	when tactical indicators are alarming, the intelligence agency should issue a warning that means that as far as it can establish the likelihood of an attack is high. (Honig, 2007)
	•	indicators or signposts are often paired with scenarios to identify which of several possible scenarios is developing. (Honig, 2007)
	•	They are also used to measure change toward an undesirable condition, such as political instability or a humanitarian crisis, or toward a desirable condition, such as economic reform or democratization. (Honig, 2007)
Indicators Validator
	•	The Indicators Validator is a simple tool that was developed by Pherson Associates in 2008 to assess the diagnostic power of indicators. It is particularly useful when developing indicators for competing hypotheses or alternative scenarios. Once an analyst has developed a set of alternative scenarios or future worlds, the next step is to generate indicators for each scenario (or world) that would appear if that particular world were beginning to emerge. (Pherson, 2009)
	•	A critical question that is not often asked is whether a given indicator would appear only in the scenario to which it is assigned or in one or more alternative scenarios as well. Indicators that could appear in several scenarios are not considered diagnostic, suggesting that they are not particularly useful in determining whether a specific scenario is emerging. (Pherson, 2009)
	•	The ideal indicator is highly consistent for the world it is assigned and highly inconsistent for all other worlds. (Pherson, 2009)
Individual
Average individual
	•	The mental equipment of the average individual consists of a mass of judgments on most of the subjects which touch his daily physical or mental life. These judgments are the tools of his daily being and yet they are his judgments, not on a basis of research and logical deduction, but for the most part dogmatic expressions accepted on the authority of his parents, his teachers, his church, and of his social, his economic and other leaders. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	“If we examine the mental furniture of the average man,” says William Trotter, the author of a comprehensive study of the social psychology of the individual,1 “we shall find it made up of a vast number of judgments of a very precise kind upon subjects of very great variety, complexity, and difficulty. He will have fairly settled views upon the origin and nature of the universe, and upon what he will probably call its meaning; he will have conclusions as to what is to happen to him at death and after, as to what is and what should be the basis of conduct. He will know how the country should be governed, and why it is going to the dogs, why this piece of legislation is good and that bad. He will have strong views upon military and naval strategy, the principles of taxation, the use of alcohol and vaccination, the treatment of influenza, the prevention of hydrophobia, upon municipal trading, the teaching of Greek, upon what is permissible in art, satisfactory in literature, and hopeful in science. “The bulk of such opinions must necessarily be without rational basis, since many of them are concerned with problems admitted by the expert to be still unsolved, while as to the rest it is clear that the training and experience of no average man can qualify him to have any opinion upon them at all. The rational method adequately used would have told him that on the great majority of these questions there could be for him but one attitude—that of suspended judgment.” (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
Individual rights
	•	To make matters worse, our culture tends to emphasize the supreme value of the individual and individual rights, encouraging greater Self-involvement. We find more and more people who cannot imagine that others have a different perspective, that we are all not exactly the same in what we desire or think. (Greene, 2018)
Individual outcome
	•	Similar phenomena appear also in more complicated social ‘games’, where an individual’s outcome can be strongly influenced by his or her position in a network of relations. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
Individualism
	•	Individualism as a type of culture pays rewards to new knowledge. Individualism is not a formal system of governance so much as a competitive market system; even for ideas and facts its controlling principles are embedded in market exchange; characteristically the community arbitrates what is permissible through price (Douglas, 2005:32)
	•	individualism needs a political base to assure its basic security (Douglas, 2005:33)
Individualist culture
	•	individualist culture finds ways of making its disadvantaged members disappear from sight. To stop stigmatizing would be another way of making them invisible (Douglas, 2005:36)
	•	[…] individualist culture, the weak are going to carry the blame for what happens to them (Douglas, 2005:36)
	•	Individualist cultures support self-regulation, including the free dom to bid and bargain. (Wildavsky and Dake, 1990)
	•	An individualist, defined as a market-oriented person that strongly believes in the blessings ofthe choices offree entrepreneurs (Boholm, 1996)
	•	To make matters worse, our culture tends to emphasize the supreme value of the individual and individual rights, encouraging greater Self-involvement. We find more and more people who cannot imagine that others have a different perspective, that we are all not exactly the same in what we desire or think. (Greene, 2018)
Industrialization
	•	As Maurice Paerton has argued, industrialization shaped the nature of war as much as it influenced the character of peace. More to the point, it transformed the nature of the relationship between the two; and that is precisely where defence policy making takes place (Dillon, 1988)
Industrial society
	•	In industrial society, social life within the framework of the nuclear family become normative and standardized (Beck, 1992)
	•	[…] industrial society is represented by volume consumption of durable consumer goods or realization of heavy mass consumption centering around motorization (Masuda, 1980) 
Infections
	•	Infections often arise and wane unpredictably (Sockett 1994). Some infections are predictable on a population basis, but not at a particular time and place. Other infections can be catastrophic but are impossible to predict (Roberts, 2001a)
Inference
	•	The method of inference that can be applied in any given situation is determined by the type of information that is available. As a consequence, we do not only know less in situations of significant uncertainty; we might also not be able to make the same use of the little that we do know. (Frühling, 2014)
Inference options
	•	The committee used the phrase “inference options” to describe the array of possibilities. (National Research Council (U.S.) et al., 2009)
	•	Inference options have come to be called default options (National Research Council (U.S.) et al., 2009)
Inference guidelines
	•	[…] “inference guidelines”; these were to contain “an explicit statement of a predetermined choice among alternative inference options” (National Research Council (U.S.) et al., 2009)
	•	Thus, agencies should take steps to describe, in explicit guidelines, the technical approaches used to conduct risk assessments, and these guidelines should include specification of the assumptions (including, in some cases, models) that would be consistently used to draw inferences in all the analytic components of the risk-assessment process where they are needed. (National Research Council (U.S.) et al., 2009)
Influence
	•	Influence over people and the power that it brings are gained in the opposite way from what you might imagine. Normally we try to charm people with our own ideas, showing ourselves off in the best light. We hype our past accomplishments. We promise great things about ourselves. We ask for favors, believing that being honest is the best policy. What we do not realize is that we are putting all of the attention on ourselves. In a world where people are increasingly self-absorbed, this only has the effect of making others turn more inward in return and think more of their own interests rather than ours. (Greene, 2018)
	•	the royal road to influence and power is to go the opposite direction: Put the focus on others. Let them do the talking. Let them be the stars of the show. Their opinions and values are worth emulating. The causes they support are the noblest. Such attention is so rare in this world, and people are so hungry for it, that giving them such validation will lower their defenses and open their minds to whatever ideas you want to insinuate. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Your first move then is always to step back and assume an inferior position in relation to the other. Make it subtle. Ask for their advice. People are dying to impart their wisdom and experience. Once you feel that they are addicted to this attention, you can initiate a cycle of favors by doing something small for them, something that saves them time or effort. They will instantly want to reciprocate and will return the favor without feeling manipulated or pushed. And once people do favors for you, they will continue to work on your behalf. In doing something for you, they have judged you worthy of this, and to stop helping you would mean to call into question their original judgment and their own intelligence, which people are very reluctant to do. Working slowly this way in a group, you will expand your influence without its seeming aggressive or even purposeful, the ultimate disguise for your ambitions. (Greene, 2018)
	•	We humans cannot stand feelings of powerlessness. We need to have influence or we become miserable. (Greene, 2018)
	•	we humans cannot avoid trying to influence others. Everything we say or do is examined and interpreted by others for clues as to our intentions. (Greene, 2018)
	•	As social animals we cannot avoid constantly playing the game, whether we are conscious of this or not. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Since the game is unavoidable, better to be skillful at it than in denial or merely improvising in the moment. (Greene, 2018)
	•	being good at influence is actually more socially beneficial than the moral stance. By having this power, we can influence people who have dangerous or antisocial ideas. Becoming proficient at persuasion requires that we immerse ourselves in the perspective of others, exercising our empathy. We might have to abide by the cultural prejudice and nod our heads in agreement about the need for complete honesty, but inwardly we must realize that this is nonsense and practice what is necessary for our own well-being. (Greene, 2018)
	•	The following five strategies—distilled from the examples of the greatest influencers in history—are designed to help you focus more deeply on your targets and create the kinds of emotional effects that will help lower people’s resistance. It would be wise to put all five into practice. (Greene, 2018)
	•	As social animals, we are extremely susceptible to the moods of other people. This gives us the power to subtly infuse into people the appropriate mood for influencing them. If you are relaxed and anticipating a pleasurable experience, this will communicate itself and have a mirror-like effect on the other person. One of the best attitudes to adapt for this purpose is one of complete indulgence. You do not judge other people; you accept them as they are. (Greene, 2018)
	•	No attempt at influence can ever work if people feel in any way that they are being coerced or manipulated. They must choose to do whatever it is you want them to do, or they must at least experience it as their choice. The more deeply you can create this impression, the greater your chances of success. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Your attempts at influence must always follow a similar logic: how can you get others to perceive the favor you want to ask for as something they already desire? Framing it as something pleasurable, as a rare opportunity, and as something other people want to do will generally have the proper effect. (Greene, 2018)
	•	when giving people gifts or rewards as a possible means of winning them over to your side, it is always best to give smaller gifts or rewards than larger ones. Large gifts make it too apparent that you are trying to buy their loyalty, which will offend people’s sense of independence. Some might accept large gifts out of need, but later they will feel resentful or suspicious. Smaller gifts have a better effect— people can tell themselves they deserve such things and are not being bought or bribed. In fact, such smaller rewards, spread out over time, will bind people to you in a much greater way than anything lavish. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Some people are particularly resistant to any form of influence. They are most often people with deeper levels of insecurity and low self-opinion. This can manifest itself in a rebellious attitude. Such types feel as if it is them against the world. They must assert their will at all costs and resist any kind of change. They will do the opposite of what people suggest. They will seek advice for a particular problem or symptom, only to find dozens of reasons of why the advice given won’t work for them. (Greene, 2018)
Influence diagram
	•	In it, each node-link-node combination portrays an “influence,” in the sense that the value of the concept at the beginning of an arrow affects the value of the concept at the arrow’s point. (Bostrom et al., 1992)
	•	influence diagram has a hierarchical structure. (Bostrom et al., 1992)
	•	there are up to five levels of detail in the concepts whose values could influence the state of some higher level concept. (Bostrom et al., 1992)
	•	an influence diagram should capture the relationships needed to structure a decision, as well as to estimate its parameters. (Bostrom et al., 1992)
	•	a fully specified decision would contain complete conditional probability distributions for all influences. (Bostrom et al., 1992)
	•	If people’s beliefs could be characterized in terms of deviations from this model, that could provide an orderly basis for determining the content of risk communications. (Bostrom et al., 1992)
	•	An influence diagram is a directed network that represents the dependencies and events in a process. (Atman et al., 1994)
	•	Each node represents an event in this probabilistic process; each link represents a directed influence, showing the dependency of an event at the head of an arrow on that at its tail. (Atman et al., 1994)
	•	The diagram is hierarchical in structure, with the bold nodes representing the basic events (concepts), which the risk communication should include. In principle, each link offers an opportunity for mitigation (although in practice many are not currently feasible). (Atman et al., 1994)

Information-gathering
	•	The gathering of information is central to all regulation, and particularly to risk regulation when issues of probability and consequence are in question. Indeed, when the politics runs hot in risk regulation it is often the information-gathering element that is in contention. (Hood et al., 2001)
	•	there has been a long-running debate in risk policy over the quality of information that is used to detect and assess risk. (Hood et al., 2001)
	•	there is a long-running debate about how scientific information is interpreted and used by different actors of different professional, institutional, and cultural backgrounds. (Hood et al., 2001)
	•	nformation about risks can be gathered in many ways. For instance, it can be obtained by regulators conducting their own analyses and experiments, by imposing legal requirements to report, test, or register on others, or by paying others to provide information. It can be provided voluntarily by complainants or whistleblowers or individuals willing to contribute to common learning, as in the case of anonymous reporting systems for errors or near-misses. Or it can be obtained willy-nilly through physical surveillance devices like black-box flight recorders or spy satellites. Often the information-gathering component of a regulatory regime consists of a mixture of such methods. (Hood et al., 2001)
	•	Risk regulators also vary in the extent to which they gather information by active, reactive, or interactive methods. (Hood et al., 2001)
Information process
	•	The cumulative message inherent in many pieces of information may be significant but is attenuated when this information is not examined as a whole. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	The system requires the intelligence analyst to come up with an almost instant diagnosis before sufficient hard infor- mation, and the broader background information that may be needed to gain perspective, become available to make possible a well-grounded judgment. This diagnosis can only be based upon the analyst’s preconceptions concerning how and why events normally transpire in a given society. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	There are three ways in which information may be learned or committed to memory: by rote, assimilation, or use of a mnemonic device. (Heuer, 1999)
Rule-based processing
	•	rule-based processing follows from the execution of one or more rules that are assumed to be relevant to the task (e.g., modus ponens or the conjunction rule). 
Associative processing 
	•	Associative processing is a more spontaneous form of processing that operates by principles of similarity and temporal contiguity. Associative processing
	•	In associative processing, the situational context influences responses directly, just as associatively based priming influences the recognition of a target word. Pathways and patterns of activation follow principles of similarity and temporal contiguity; the stronger the association between two concepts (which depends on similarity, repeated joint exposure, etc.), the more activation passes from one to another. Associative processing
	•	associative processing is not mediated by conscious appraisal it is difficult to suppress its influence on judgments and decisions. Associative processing
Depth of processing
	•	Depth of processing is the second important variable in determin- ing how well information is retained. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Depth of processing refers to the amount of effort and cognitive capacity employed to process information, and the number and strength of associations that are thereby forged between the data to be learned and knowledge already in memory. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	the greater the depth of processing, the greater the ability to recall words on a list. (Heuer, 1999)

Rote
	•	Material to be learned is repeated verbally with sufficient frequency that it can later be repeated from memory without use of any memory aids. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	When information is learned by rote, it forms a separate schema not closely interwoven with previously held knowledge. That is, the mental processing adds little by way of elaboration to the new information, and the new information adds little to the elaboration of existing schemata. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Learning by rote is a brute force technique. It seems to be the least efficient way of remembering. (Heuer, 1999)
Assimilation
	•	Information is learned by assimilation when the structure or substance of the information fits into some memory schema already possessed by the learner. The new information is assimilated to or linked to the existing schema and can be retrieved readily by first accessing the existing schema and then reconstructing the new information. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Assimilation involves learning by comprehension and is, therefore, a desirable method, but it can only be used to learn information that is somehow related to our previous experience. (Heuer, 1999)
Mnemonic Device
	•	A mnemonic device is any means of organizing or encoding information for the purpose of making it easier to remember. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Mnemonic devices are useful for remembering information that does not fit any appropriate conceptual structure or schema already in memory. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	They work by providing a simple, artificial structure to which the information to be learned is then linked. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	The mnemonic device supplies the mental “file categories” that ensure retrievability of information. To remember, first recall the mnemonic device, then access the desired information. (Heuer, 1999)
Information society
	•	[…] information society may be termed as a society with highly intellectual creativity where people may draw future designs on an invisible canvas and pursue and realize individual lives worth living. (Masuda, 1980)
Injury
	•	Les blessures morales ont cela de particulier qu'elles se cachent, mais ne se referment pas ; toujours douloureuses, toujours prêtes à saigner quand on les touche, elles restent vives et béantes dans le coeur. (Dumas, 1998)
Innovation
	•	Innovation and learning depend on variation, cross-pollination of ideas, and are stifled by unilateral mandates. (Dudley, 2014)
	•	An innovation is usually defined as something original, new and important that breaks into a market or society and adds significant value. (Royal Society of Chemistry, 2014)
	•	Innovation frequently involves substitution e.g. quill pen to fountain pen to manual typewriter to electric typewriter to word processing software. (Royal Society of Chemistry, 2014)
	•	It has been observed that innovation in CAS is mostly a matter of combining well-known components in new ways. (Holland, 2014)
Insecurity
	•	[…] because insecurity is often associated with proximity, this interdependence is far from uniform (Buzan and Wæver, 2003)
	•	Insecurity has come to refer to everything from anxieties about crime, unemployment, financial uncertainty, and personal health, to concerns at the international level about the dangers of climate change, population growth, and terrorism. (Zedner, 2009)
	•	because most political and military threats travelmore easily over short distances than over long ones, insecurity is oftenassociated with proximity. (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	In his election campaign in 2001, the French Prime Minster, Lionel Jospin, proclaimed ‘a battle against insecurity’ (Bauman 2003:120). And that is the problem: many things now make us insecure. (Coker, 2009)
	•	Insecurity is now a permanent feature of the world in which we live. The point is that in every age there is a turning point, a new way of seeing and understanding the coherence of the world. (Coker, 2009)
	•	Insecurity is thus not merely a reality of the environment in which we live; it has become an existential state. (Coker, 2009)
	•	A state of public insecurity on the other hand is not hard to detect, whether caused by fear of attack by terrorists or criminals, fear of pandemic disease or by fear of unemployment. (Omand, 2014)
	•	Everyone has particular insecurities —about their looks, their creative powers, their masculinity, their power status, their uniqueness, their popularity, et cetera. (Greene, 2018)
	•	We never really feel secure. (Greene, 2018)
Insight
	•	You will not be simply intuitive, but rather you will analyze the information you glean in this empathic fashion, gaining insights. You will continually cycle between empathy and analysis, always updating what you observe and increasing your ability to see the world through their eyes. You will notice a physical sensation of connection between you and the other that will emerge from this practice. (Greene, 2018)
Insurance
	•	Insurance is the usual way of spreading actuarially based risks (Roberts, 2001a)
	•	Insurance is one of the oldest strategies for coping with risks.(') Its origins can be traced to early attempts at setting interest rates, which first arose in Mesopotamia. Records of interest rates in that area predate 3000 B.C. (Covello and Mumpower, 1986)
	•	The term 'insurance' is an equivocal one. It can designate, in the first place, the institutions of insurance, whatever their objective or social form may be. Private and nationalized companies, social security schemes, murualist societies, companies run on a premium basis,accidental death, fire, civil liability: there are a multiplicity  of such institutional types, which specialists have set out to classify in various ways, distinguishing between insurances of persons and property, mutualist and premium systems, social and privat einsurance. Each insurance institution differs from the others in its purposes its clientele, ,its legal. basis (Foucault et al., 1991)
	•	Actually, the term 'insurance' denotes not just these institutions but also a factor which gives a unity to their diversity, enables an institution to be identified as an insurance institution and signals what an institution has to be to be an insurance institution. In this second meaning, insurance designates not so much a concept as an abstract technology. (Foucault et al., 1991)
	•	In insurance the term designate neither an event nor a general kind of event occurring in reality (the unfortunate kind), but a specific mode of treatment of certain events capable of happening to a group of individuals - or, more exactly, to values or capitals possessed or represented by a collectivity of individuals: that is to say, a population. (Foucault et al., 1991)
	•	Insurance can be defined as a technology of risk. In fact, the term 'risk' which one finds being used nowadays apropos of everything has no precise meaning other than as a category of this technology. Risk neologism of insurance, said to derive from the Italian word which meant 'that which cut?, hence 'reef and consequently 'risk to cargo on the high seas'. Say's Dictionary of Political Economy states that theory of insurance rests on the fundamental notion of risk'. The notion of risk is likewise central to the juridical definition of insurance: “ risk is the fundamental element of insurance, since it is the very object of this type of contract'. Risk constitutes an essential element of insurance, the fundamental element, even, for Picard and Besson who add: ‘this notion of risk is specific in its origin to the law and science of insurance, and  differs markedly from the notion of risk utilised in civil law and everyday speech'. So what is this thing called risk.  (Foucault et al., 1991)
	•	Insurance is not initially a practice of compensation or reparation. It is the practice of a certain type of rationality: one formalized by the calculus of probabilities. This is why one never insures oneself except against risks, and why the latter can include such different things as death, an accident, hailstorms, a disease, a birth, military
bankruptcy and litigation. (Foucault et al., 1991)
	•	The insurer's activity is not just a matter of passively registering the existence of risks, and then offering guarantees against them. He 'produces risks', he makes risks appear where each person had hitherto felt obliged to submit resignedly to the blows of fortune. It is characteristic of insurance that it constitutes a certain type of objectivity, giving certain familiar events a kind of reality which alters their nature. By objectivizing certain events as risks, insurance can invert their meanings: it can make what was previously an obstacle into a possibility. Insurance assigns a new mode of existence to previously dreaded events; it creates value: Insurance is eminently creative where, completing the interrupted work the snatched by death from the hands of the family man, it instantly realizes the capital which was to have been the fruit of savings; it is eminently creative when it gives the aged man with inadequate resources the pension sustain hi sdeclining years. (Foucault et al., 1991)
	•	Insurance is the practice of a type of rationality potentially capable of transforming the life of individuals and that of a population. (Foucault et al., 1991)
	•	For certain thinkers, 'insurance is called upon to extend indefinitely the field of guarantees it affords against risk and to attain the form of an "integral" insurance. (Foucault et al., 1991)
	•	Insurance is one of those practices linked to what Pascal called 'geometry of hazard' or 'algebra of chances' and is today called the calculus of probabilities. Thus it is a sister activity, along with demography, econometrics and opinion polls, of Quetelet's social physics. Like this, it is an application of probability calculus to statistics. (Foucault et al., 1991)
	•	From these three characteristics of risk as 'the actual value of a possible damage in a determined unit of time', one can deduce a definition of insurance as: 'the commpensation of effects of chance through mutuality organised according to the laws of statistics’: Insurance does not, as has been mistakenly said, eliminate chance, but it fixes its scope; it does not abolish loss, but ensures that loss, by being shared, felt. Insurance is the mechanism through which this sharing is operated. It modifies the incidence of loss, diverting it from the individual to the community. It substitutes a relation of extension for a relation of intensity. (Foucault et al., 1991)
	•	Insurance is not just an operation which provides at a minimum premium for compensation through mutuality of losses that fall on one person or another. (Foucault et al., 1991)
	•	What distinguishes insurance is not just that it spreads the burden of individual injuries over a froup, but that it enables this to be done no longer in the name of help or charity but according to a priniciple of justice, a rule of right. (Foucault et al., 1991)
	•	This 'proportional share' is what defines the notion of risk used in insurance. (Foucault et al., 1991)
	•	Insurance, then, is the practice of acertain type of rationality. It has no special field of operations; rather than being defined in terms of its  objects, it is a kind of ubiquitous form. It provides a general principle for the objectification of things, people and their relations. (Foucault et al., 1991)
	•	Insurance possesses several distinct dimensions of technique. In the first place, it is an economic and financial technique. (Foucault et al., 1991)
	•	insurance is a moral technology. To calculate a risk is to master time, to discipline the future. (Foucault et al., 1991)
	•	Les compagnies d’assurance permettent à des individus ou des investisseurs d’éliminer certains risques. Les clients transfèrent donc leurs risques assurables à une compagnie d’assurance qui elle, en revanche, doit les gérer efficacement afin d’éviter des scénarios catastrophiques qui pourraient mettre en péril la situation financière de l’entreprise et par le fait même maintenir sa profitabilité. De manière générale, le client paie une prime d’assurance afin d’avoir droit à un dédommagement selon les conditions du contrat d’assurance. Le type d’événement donnant droit à une indemnité varie selon le type d’assurance demandé par l’assuré. Nous pouvons autant parler de risques non financiers (assurance automobile) que de risques financiers (par exemple le « credit default swap »). (Dumont, 2011)
	•	les compagnies d’assurance tentent de bien quantifier le risque qu’ils assument afin de déterminer la prime, qui accumulée avec toutes les primes des assurés, servira à compenser les indemnités qu’elle devra faire lorsque l’événement assuré se produira. Ces primes accumulées sont entre-temps placées dans des actifs à risque peu élevé, telles les obligations, et sont reti- rées lorsqu’une réclamation se présente. (Dumont, 2011)
	•	Dans le cadre de ses opérations, une des tâches les plus impor- tantes d’une compagnie d’assurance est de gérer efficacement les risques auxquels elle s’expose en assurant des clients. Ces risques peuvent être catégorisés de la manière suivante : risque actuariel, risque systématique, risque de crédit, risque de liquidité, risque opérationnel et risque légal (Laporte, 2002). (Dumont, 2011)
	•	L’assureur propose un certain nombre de garanties aux sous- cripteurs (qu’on appelle preneurs dans le jargon juridique, qui choisissent les couvertures qu’ils jugent appropriées en prenant en compte leur activité, la prime exigée et les conditions contractuelles (conditions, exclusions, franchises, coassurance, etc.). Au départ, l’assurance est essentiellement une offre de contracter. Le contrat se réalise par l’acceptation du preneur (l’assuré). (Dumont, 2011)
	•	Il est impossible de maîtriser parfaitement le risque, d’où le recours à la prévention et à la précaution. L’assureur a tout intérêt à ce que l’assuré tente de maîtriser au maximum ses risques assurables, ce qui diminue les probabilités de réalisation, donc les primes, et ce qui bonifie son portefeuille assurable. (Dumont, 2011)
	•	l’assureur doit surveiller les risques, il en va de sa survie, comme le lait sur le feu, notamment les changements majeurs qui pointent à l’horizon (climatiques, démographiques, économiques), tout comme les comportements individuels engendrés par ces changements (nouveaux produits et manière de les utiliser). (Dumont, 2011)
	•	l’assurance n’est pas toujours possible ni souhaitable, techniquement ou financièrement. Les compagnies d’assurance, mêmes les plus importantes, ne pourraient pas être en mesure d’in- demniser les risques en série ou les conséquences de catastrophes exceptionnelles. Ils font alors appel à des techniques financières. (Dumont, 2011)
	•	Une compagnie d’assurance ne devrait que gérer les risques pour lesquels elle est la plus efficace et ainsi laisser à d’autres compagnies (réassurance) ou aux marchés financiers la gestion des autres risques. (Dumont, 2011)
Reinsurance
	•	The technique of reinsurance in particular, with its special kind of alchemy, shows very well what a risk can be from the insurance point of view: an abstract quantity that can be divided at will, one part of which an insurer can hand over to a reinsureror in Munich or Zurich, who will balance them up with risks of a similar kind but located on the other side of the world. (Foucault et al., 1991)
	•	Une compagnie d’assurance ne devrait que gérer les risques pour lesquels elle est la plus efficace et ainsi laisser à d’autres compagnies (réassurance) ou aux marchés financiers la gestion des autres risques. (Dumont, 2011)
	•	La réassurance sert justement aux assureurs à transférer les risques qu’ils n’ont pas été en mesure de diversifier. Dans cette situation, l’assureur deviendra le cédant qui paiera une prime au réassureur, dit cessionnaire, qui est maintenant l’assureur. Le réassureur à son tour diversifie ses risques en rétrocédant les mêmes risques pour plusieurs clients. Il réussit à augmenter sa diversification des mêmes risques dans différents endroits géographiques et dans différents secteurs, réduisant ainsi la corrélation entre les risques. Encore une fois, il est impossible pour le réassureur de complètement éliminer les risques, donc inévitablement, autant l’assureur que le réassureur n’ont le choix de maintenir certains risques dans l’entreprise. (Dumont, 2011)
	•	La théorie qui sous-tend le raisonnement de la réassurance est la loi des grands nombres. En supposant que les risques sont identi- quement distribués, la loi des grands nombres stipule que la moyenne d’un échantillon s’approche de la vraie moyenne (la moyenne de la population) à mesure que la taille de l’échantillon augmente. Selon cette théorie, la perte espérée est relativement facile à prédire. (Dumont, 2011)
Risk insurance
	•	In insurance the term designate neither an event nor a general kind of event occurring in reality (the unfortunate kind), but a specific mode of treatment of certain events capable of happening to a group of individuals - or, more exactly, to values or capitals possessed or represented by a collectivity of individuals: that is to say, a population. (Foucault et al., 1991)
	•	Nothing is a risk in itself; there is no risk in reality. But on the other hand, anything can be a risk. (Foucault et al., 1991)
	•	everything can be a risk, in so far as the type of event it falls under can be treated according to the principle of insurance technology. (Foucault et al., 1991)
	•	Risk in the meaning of insurance has three great characteristics: it is calculable, it is collective, and it is a capital. (Foucault et al., 1991)
	•	Risk is calculable. This is the essential point, whereby insurance is radically distinct from a bet or a lottery. For an event to be a risk, it must be possible be possible to evaluate its probability. Insurance has a dual basis: the statistical table which establishes the regularity of certain events, and the calculus of probabilities applied to that statistic, which yields an evaluation of the chances of that class of event actually occurring. (Foucault et al., 1991)
	•	Risk is collective. Whereas an accident, as damage, suffering, is always individual, striking at one and not another, a risk of accident affects a population. Strictly speaking there is no such thing as an  individual risk; otherwise insurance would be no more than a wager. Risk only becomes something calculable when it is spread over a population. (Foucault et al., 1991)
	•	The work of the insurer is, precisely, to constitute that population by selecting and dividing risks. Insurance can only cover groups; it works by socializing risks. It makes each person a part of the whole. Risk itself only exists as an entity, a certainty, in the whole, so that each person insured represents only a fraction of it. Insurance's characteristic operation is the constitution of mutualities: conscious ones, in the case of the mutualist associations; unconscious ones, in the case of the premium companies. (Foucault et al., 1991)
	•	The idea of risk assumes that all the individuals who compose a population are on the same footing: each person is afactor of risk, each person is exposed to risk. But this does not mean that everyone causes or suffers the same degrees of risk. The risk defines the whole, but each individual is distinguished by the probability of risk which falls to his or her share. Insurance individualizes, it defines each person as a risk, but the individuality it confers no longer correlates with an abstract, invariant norm such as that of the responsible juridical subject: it is anielative to that of other members of the insured population,  an average sociological individuality. (Foucault et al., 1991)
	•	Risk, lastly, is a capital. What is insured is not the injury that is actually lived, suffered and resented by the person it happens to, but a capital against whose loss the insurer offers a guarantee. The lived injury is irreparable: afterwards can never be the same as before. One does not replace a father or mother, any more than one relaces an impairment of one's bodily integrity. (Foucault et al., 1991)
	•	The idea of risk is not an instrument for identifying the cause of an injury, but a rule by which to distribute its weight. (Foucault et al., 1991)
	•	La première caté- gorie représente les risques que l’assureur ne peut éliminer ou éviter dans ses activités courantes tels les risques actuariels, systématiques, opérationnels et légaux. L’assureur a deux techniques à sa disposition afin d’éviter ce genre de risque. Tout d’abord, il doit implanter un processus standardisé de soumission qui empêchera la prise de mauvaises décisions. Ensuite, il peut se construire un portefeuille d’affaires lui permettant de profiter du principe de diversification (la loi des grands nombres et le théorème de limite centrale) afin de réduire l’impact des risques qu’il ne peut éviter. (Dumont, 2011)
	•	La deuxième catégorie comprend les risques dont l’assureur n’a pas l’expertise nécessaire pour les gérer efficacement et qui doivent être transférés à l’externe. Garder ces risques à l’interne engendrerait une perte de valeur pour la compagnie d’assurance. Dans cette caté- gorie, nous retrouvons le risque actuariel et le risque de taux d’intérêt, qui peuvent être gérés par l’assureur, mais qui dans certains cas peu- vent être éliminés de manière plus efficace à l’aide de la réassurance et de produits dérivés sur taux d’intérêt (contrats à terme, swap, caps, floors, etc.). (Dumont, 2011)
	•	a troisième catégorie comprend les risques dont l’assu- reur possède l’expertise et par conséquent pouvant être gérés active- ment à l’interne. Cette catégorie comprend des risques qui créent de la valeur pour la compagnie d’assurance s’ils sont gérés à l’interne, car il en coûterait plus cher de les transférer à l’externe. Ceci peut être expliqué par la nature complexe du risque, ce qui rend coûteux le transfert d’information ou simplement par le fait que ce risque représente la spécialité de l’assureur, faisant en sorte qu’il est le plus efficace pour le gérer. Par exemple, l’assureur peut détenir un avantage compétitif au niveau du risque actuariel de sa principale branche d’affaires. (Dumont, 2011)
Insurer
	•	Insurers accept a premium (usually a financial price per period of coverage) in return for accepting some responsibility for a risk (usually a promise to pay monies toward the financial costs that you would suffer due to agreed events). (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Insurers cover some risks at standard rates—these standard risks are easier for the insurer to assess, such as potential harm from road traffic accidents, home fires, and work-related injuries. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	L’assureur propose un certain nombre de garanties aux sous- cripteurs (qu’on appelle preneurs dans le jargon juridique, qui choisissent les couvertures qu’ils jugent appropriées en prenant en compte leur activité, la prime exigée et les conditions contractuelles (conditions, exclusions, franchises, coassurance, etc.). Au départ, l’assurance est essentiellement une offre de contracter. Le contrat se réalise par l’acceptation du preneur (l’assuré). (Dumont, 2011)
	•	Il est impossible de maîtriser parfaitement le risque, d’où le recours à la prévention et à la précaution. L’assureur a tout intérêt à ce que l’assuré tente de maîtriser au maximum ses risques assurables, ce qui diminue les probabilités de réalisation, donc les primes, et ce qui bonifie son portefeuille assurable. (Dumont, 2011)
	•	l’assureur doit surveiller les risques, il en va de sa survie, comme le lait sur le feu, notamment les changements majeurs qui pointent à l’horizon (climatiques, démographiques, économiques), tout comme les comportements individuels engendrés par ces chan- gements (nouveaux produits et manière de les utiliser). (Dumont, 2011)
Risk insurer
	•	The insurer's calculation is based on the objective probability of an accident, regardless of the action of will: no matter whether it results from someone or other's fault, or whether it could have been averted, the fact is that, regardless of the good or ill will of people, regardless of what they might or might not have been able to do, accidents occur at a particular, specific rate. (Foucault et al., 1991)
	•	The insurer’s attitude, on the contrary, is wholly one of registering a fact: small matter what would have happened if.. ., the fact is that there is such and number of industrial or traffic accidents annually, that whatever the wishes may be that one cares to voice, the figures repeat themselves with overwhelming regularity. (Foucault et al., 1991)
	•	This constancy strikingly manifests the objective nature of risk. Regardless of the size of a workforce or the turnover of its recruits, a given mine or factory will show a consistent percentage of injuries and death. When put in the context of apopulation, the accident which taken onseems both random and avoidable (given a little prudence) can be treated as predictable and calculable. One can predict that during the next year there will be a certain number of accidents, the only unknown being who will have an accident, who will draw one of existence's unlucky numbers. All of which means not that accidents are unavoidable, or that they are works of a destined fate; but that the juridical perception of them in terms of fault and responsibility is not the only possible one, or perhaps he one which is the most pertinent and effective. (Foucault et al., 1991)
Insurgency
	•	insurgency became one of his two great models for Prussian resistance against Napoleon. (Heuser, 2010a)
Integrity of science 
	•	integrity of science starts to be undermined when scientists themselves suggest that the grey area of uncertainty should be occupied by them alone rather than being shared with those implementing policy (Boyd, 2013)
Intellectual
	•	Intellectuals are often the last to really discern the spirit of the times, because they are so grounded in theories and conventional frameworks. (Greene, 2018)
Intent
	•	Intent is a person’s resolution or determination to do something. (Newsome, 2013)
Human intent
	•	Human intent could be understood as deliberative (such as a malicious car driver) or accidental (a sleepy car driver). (Newsome, 2013)
Interaction
Adaptive interaction 
	•	adaptive interaction, where interacting agents (as in markets or the Prisoner’s Dilemma) modify their strategies in diverse ways as experience accumulates. (Holland, 2014)
Interaction analysis
	•	The psychometric and interaction analysis traditions typically involve `quantitative' and `explanatory' research (Ellis, 2006)
Interest
Personnal interest
	•	La seconde cause est « la contagion mentale » (ibid.) que l’auteur rattache aux phénomènes d’ordre hypnotique. « Chez une foule, écrit-il, tout sentiment, tout acte est contagieux à ce point que l’individu sacrifie très facilement son intérêt personnel à l’intérêt collectif. C’est là une aptitude contraire à sa nature, et dont l’homme ne devient guère capable que lorsqu’il fait partie d’une foule. ». (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Montesquieu montre bien que, lorsque l’intérêt particulier se joue de l’intérêt général et qu’il n’y a plus d’esprit civique, il n’y a par suite plus de société possible : on n’a plus affaire qu’à un ramassis d’individus livrés à la loi hobbienne du plus fort sur fond d’anarchie. (Mannoni, 1985)
Collective interest
	•	La seconde cause est « la contagion mentale » (ibid.) que l’auteur rattache aux phénomènes d’ordre hypnotique. « Chez une foule, écrit-il, tout sentiment, tout acte est contagieux à ce point que l’individu sacrifie très facilement son intérêt personnel à l’intérêt collectif. C’est là une aptitude contraire à sa nature, et dont l’homme ne devient guère capable que lorsqu’il fait partie d’une foule. ». (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Montesquieu montre bien que, lorsque l’intérêt particulier se joue de l’intérêt général et qu’il n’y a plus d’esprit civique, il n’y a par suite plus de société possible : on n’a plus affaire qu’à un ramassis d’individus livrés à la loi hobbienne du plus fort sur fond d’anarchie. (Mannoni, 1985)
Interest groups
	•	interest groups by their very nature want to promote their own interests (whether halting the construction of a waste incinerator or protecting the environment in general), and the most effective way to do so is to promote distrust in those institutions that are in charge of the issue in question (usually regulators and industry). In many cases, the less interest group involvement, the more successful the outcome of the proposed strategy will be.
Interdepedancy
	•	interdependence does not require proximity. (Renn, 2007b)
	•	The more interdependencies there are within a particular setting (be this a set of organizational units or companies, a geographical area, or a number of countries) and the more that this setting’s entities – or participants – decide not to invest in risk reduction while being able to contaminate other entities, the less incentive each potentially affected participant will have to invest in protection. (Renn, 2007b)
Interdependent world 
	•	In an interdependent world, the risks faced by any individual, company, region or country depend not only on their own choices but also on those of others. Nor do these entities face one risk at a time: they need to find strate- gies to deal with a series of interrelated risks that are often ill-defined or outside their control. In the context of terrorism, the risks faced by any given airline, for example, are affected by lax security at other carriers or airports. (Renn, 2007b)
	•	Because interdependence does not require proximity, the antecedents to catastrophes can be quite distinct and distant from the actual disaster, as in the case of the 11 September 2001 attacks when security failures at Boston’s Logan Airport led to crashes at the World Trade Center and the Pentagon and in rural Pennsylvania. (Renn, 2007b)
Internal control systems
	•	Internal control systems are the state in miniature and are the embodiment of a managerialized political authority (Cooper and Lousada, 2005). (Power, 2009)
Internet
	•	internet is a library of the world’s knowledges (Stilgoe et al., 2006)
	•	The internet also allows connections – between people and between different areas of knowledge (Stilgoe et al., 2006)
	•	Technological advances in recent decades have brought about a major transformation in how content is delivered, through the “communication revolution” of interactivity (48). The rise of Internet use has led to a growing familiarity with surfing between websites to gather information that may be delivered using different voices and perspectives (49, 50). These advances, along with increased comfort with active rather than passive media consumption, have made interactivity as a powerful new technique for science communication (51). The “structured self-tailoring” made possible through interactivity can allow audiences to get the most personally relevant information while keeping them within the confines of the communication (42). (Downs, 2014)
	•	The Internet is a magni cent repository of knowledge, and yet it’s also the source and enabler of a spreading epidemic of misinformation. Not only is the Internet making many of us dumber, it’s making us meaner: alone behind their keyboards, people argue rather than discuss, and insult rather than listen. (Nichols, 2017)
	•	The internet is adding more and more communities of interest which cross dangerous fault lines: the boundaries of religion, nationality, ethnicity and even culture. (Coker, 2009)
	•	With technology, it has become easier to express and satisfy our aggressive desires. Without having to physically face people, on the internet our arguments and criticisms can become that much more hostile, heated, and personal. The internet has also created a new and powerful weapon—cyberwar. As they always have, criminals simply coopt technology to become more creative and elusive. (Greene, 2018)
	•	The great success of the Internet is due to the exceptional experience it provides. Watching television is a one-direction, one-medium, passive experience. The Internet is not so. People can navigate an infinite series of documents, use different media, exchange information, and talk to each other. Unlike traditional communication technologies such as telephone, radio, or television, the Internet does not have a specific purpose. Rather, it is a mutant artefact able to host infinite applications. Actually, the Internet is only a physical infrastructure that supports services. One of the most successful of these is the World Wide Web (WWW). This is an enormous set of electronic documents recorded in the devices that make up the Internet and connected by hyperlinks that allow navigation between them. The pattern is somewhat similar to the body of scientific literature, made of articles, books, patents, etc. connected by citations. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
	•	“The idea of the WWW was born at CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research). Physicist Tim Berners-Lee (later joined by computer scientist Robert Cailliau) put forward the proposal for it in 1989. Berners-Lee designed a system that allowed scientists to access, through their own computers, the enormous amount of data produced by particle physics experiments. The software to make this system work was not patented but rather released in the public domain. This decision—as in the case of TCP/IP—proved to be very significant. Right from the beginning, thousands (and then even greater numbers) of users tried it, improved it, and created web pages and services. In just a few years, the Web became World Wide. Its magnitude is unknown, since none of the search engines that explore the web (such as Google or Yahoo!) is able to archive all web pages. After all, this would make little sense: several websites are capable of producing new pages upon request. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
	•	 A 2005 estimate put the content of the whole WWW (for static pages) as equivalent to 200 terabytes of information. At the time, this was about ten times the size of the US Congress Library. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
	•	The terrorist attacks showed that there is almost no network that stands alone. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
	•	By the nineties, the Internet was mostly an unknown land. Although it was already a critical infrastructure for communication, trading, and transportation, nobody had a clear idea about its overall architecture. Administrators controlled local networks, but had no clue about the large-scale structure of the net. Moreover, the increase had been explosive: from some tens of machines at the beginning of the seventies, to tens of millions, with even larger prospects of growth. By the end of the decade, organizations like the computer company Compaq and the Cooperative Association for Internet Data Analysis (CAIDA) launched a series of mapping projects, aimed at exploring the Internet and drawing its global layout. Compaq’s project was called Mercator, in honour of the geographer that drew in the 16th century one of the the most important maps of the world, including the recently discovered America: the Internet was acknowledged to be a ‘new world’ to be explored. Thanks to these and other projects, maps of the Internet are available, and its growth is now monitored. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
	•	The Web is constantly updated with creation and deletion of both new web pages and new hyperlinks. On some specific websites, such as Wikipedia, new articles and new connections between articles are created every day. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
	•	While the Internet seems to be relatively resistant to errors and accidents, a carefully designed attack can wreak terrible damage. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
	•	As with the Internet and the WWW, most of the real-world networks show a double-edged kind of robustness. They are able to function normally even when a large fraction of the network is damaged, but suddenly certain small failures, or targeted attacks, bring them down completely. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
Internet of things
	•	The Internet of (every) things andwearable and ubiquitous computing have turned human beings into data generation machines. (Haider, 2016)
Interpretation
National interpretation
	•	natural interpretations have been regardedeither :ts a priori presuppositions of science or else as prejudices which must be removed before any serious examination can proceed. (Feyerabend, 1993)
Interpretive approach
	•	A researcher who adopts the interpretive approach is very unlikely to depict relevant variables in table form. Since his objective is to report the subject’s vision of reality rather than to pick out generalizable features, he will be reluctant to apply his own categorizations to the responses and attitudes of the subjects studied. (Corbetta, 2003)
Interpretative community
	•	an interpretative community—it is thecontext in which principles of legitimacy and valuation circulate and withinwhich the individual constructs an interpretation of events. The referent is asocial context with the dignity of a "site of judgment" (Foucault 1979). (Buzan et al., 1997)
Intervention
	•	Intervention will always produce risks. (Coker, 2009)
Intolerance
	•	Ce n'est donc pas sans cause que les peuples ont toujours défendu leurs convictions avec intolérance. Cette intolérance, si critiquable au point de vue philosophique, représente dans la vie des peuples la plus nécessaire des vertus. C'est pour fonder ou maintenir des croyances générales que le moyen âge a élevé tant de bûchers, que tant d'inventeurs et de novateurs sont morts dans le désespoir quand ils évitaient les supplices. C'est pour les défendre que le monde a été tant de fois bouleversé, que tant de millions d'hommes sont morts sur les champs de bataille, et y mourront encore. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	It is axiomatic that men who know little are often intolerant of a point of view that is contrary to their own. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	Intolerance is almost inevitably accompanied by a natural and true inability to comprehend or make allowance for opposite points of view. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	The characteristic of the human mind to adhere to its beliefs is excellently summarized in the volume by Mr. Trotter to which reference has been made before. “It is clear,”2 says Mr. Trotter, “at the outset that these beliefs are invariably regarded as rational and defended as such, while, the position of one who holds contrary views is held to be obviously unreasonable. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
Intuition
	•	Intuition is nothing more than a sudden and immediate seizing of what is real, without the need for words or formulas. (Greene, 2014)
	•	Intuitive powers at the mastery level are a mix of the instinctive and the rational, the conscious and the unconscious, the human and the animal. It is our way of making sudden and powerful connections to the environment, to feeling othinking inside things. (Greene, 2014)
	•	Throughout history we read of Masters in every conceivable form of human endeavour describing a sensation of suddenly possessing heightened intellectual powers after years of immersion in their field. In all of these instances, these practitioners of various skills described a sesantion of seeing more. They were suddenly able to grasp an entire situation through an image or an idea, or a combination of images and ideas. They experienced this power as intuition, or a fingertip feel. (Greene, 2014)
	•	because we recognize rationality as the only legitimate form of intelligence, these experiences of “seeing more” must either be forms of rational thinking that just happen faster, or are simply miraculous by nature. (Greene, 2014)
	•	The problem we are facing here is that high-level intuition, the ultimate sign of mastery, involves ap rocess that is qualitatively different from rationality. And in understanding how it works, we can begin to see that such power is not miraculous, but intrinsically human and accessible to us all. (Greene, 2014)
	•	Through intense absorption in a particular field over a long period of time, Masters come to understand all of the parts involved in what they are studying. They reach a point where all of this has become internalized and they are no longer seeing the parts, but gain an intuitive feel for the whole. They literally see or sense the dynamic. (Greene, 2014)
	•	Masters thus have a sense of how everything interacts organically, and they can intuit patterns or solutions in an instant. This fluid form of thinking does not occur through a step-by-step process, but rather comes in flashes an insights as the brain makes sudden connections between disparate form of knowledge, causing us to sense the dynamic in real time. (Greene, 2014)
	•	It would be a misconception, however, to imagine that Masters are simply following their intuitions and moving beyond rational thinking. First, it is through all of their hard work, the depth of their knowledge, and the development of their analytical skills that they reach this higher form of intelligence. Second, when they experience this intuition or insight, they invariably subject it to a high degree of reflection and reasoning. In science, they must spend months or years verifying their intuitions. In the arts, they must work out the ideas that come to them intuitively and rationally shape them into a form. This is hard for us to imagine, because we find intuition and rationality mutually exclusive, but in fact at this high level they operate together in a seamless fasion. (Greene, 2014)
	•	The reasoning of Masters is guided by intuition; their intuition springs from intense rational focus. The two are fused. (Greene, 2014)
	•	Although time is the critical factor in attaining Mastery and this intuitive feel, the time we are talking about is not neutral or simply quantitative. (Greene, 2014)
	•	People who spend years studying a particular subject or field develop so many of these memory networkds and pathways that their brains are constantly searching for an discovering connections between various pieces of information. When confronted with a high-level problem, the search goes in a hundred directions below conscious awareness, guided by an intuitive snese of where the answer might lie. (Greene, 2014)
	•	The extremely high number of experiences and memory networkds that become hardwired allow the brains of Masters to explore and areathat is so wide that it has the dimensions and feel of reality itself, of the dunamic. (Greene, 2014)
High-level intuition
	•	High level intuition is essentially driven by memoery. When we take in information of any kind, we store it in mnemonic networkds in the brain. The stability and durability of these networkds depends on repetition, intensity of experience, and how deeply we pay attention. (Greene, 2014)
	•	This high-level intuition, like any skill, requires practice and experience. At first, our intuitions might be so faint that we do not pay attention to them or trust them. All Masters talk of this phenomenon. But over time they learn to notice these rapid ideas that come to them. They learn to act on them and verify their validity. Some lead nowhere, but others lead to tremendous insights. Over time, Masters find that they can call up more and more of these high-level intuitions, which are now sparking all over the brain. Accessing this level of thinking on a more regular basis, they can fuse it even more deeply with their rational forms of thinking. (Greene, 2014)
	•	In the world of today, the need ot attain this high-level intelligence is more critical than ever before. (Greene, 2014)
Instantaneity
	•	We no longer have the ticker tape. Instead many of us have become addicted to the minute-by-minute news cycle, to “what’s trending,” to the Twitter feed, which is often accompanied by a ping that has its own narcotic effects. We feel like we are connected to the very flow of life itself, to events as they change in real time, and to other people who are following the same instant reports. (Greene, 2018)
	•	This need to know instantly has a built-in momentum. Once we expect to have some bit of news quickly, we can never go back to the slower pace of just a year ago. In fact, we feel the need for more information more quickly. Such impatience tends to spill over into other aspects of life—driving, reading a book, following a film. Our attention span decreases, as well as our tolerance for any obstacles in our path. (Greene, 2018)
	•	We can all recognize signs of this nervous impatience in our own lives, but what we don’t recognize is the distorting effect it has on our thinking. The trends of the moment—in business or politics—are embedded in larger trends that play out over the course of weeks and months. Such larger spans of time tend to reveal the relative weaknesses and strengths of an investment, a strategic idea, a sports team, or a political candidate, which are often the opposite of what we see in the microtrends of the moment. (Greene, 2018)
Instinct
Individual instinct
	•	Motives of social behavior are based on individual instincts. Individual instincts, on the other hand, must yield to group needs. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
Investigation
	•	Investigation is usually aimed at finding the perpetrators and bringing them before a court of law to face justice. (Prunckun, 2015)
Involvement/separation dilemma
	•	The solution to the involvement/separation dilemma probably lies in striking a balance between the two perspectives: if an excessive distance hinders understanding, complete identification can also be an obstacle in that, as we shall see, the social researcher has to be able to bring to the research situation questions that derive from his own culture and experience. (Corbetta, 2003)
Irrational
	•	Irrational is a strong word, which connotes impulsivity, emotionality, and a stubborn resistance to reasonable argument. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	to some extent irrationality is a function of the structure of our brains and is wired into our very nature by the way we process emotions. Being irrational is almost beyond our control. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Clearly the words rational and irrational can be quite loaded. People are always labeling those who disagree with them “irrational.” (Greene, 2018)
	•	DO NOT IMAGINE THAT THE more extreme types of irrationality have somehow been overcome through progress and enlightenment. Throughout history we witness continual cycles of rising and falling levels of the irrational. (Greene, 2018)
	•	The irrational simply changes its look and its fashions. (Greene, 2018)
	•	As long as there are humans, the irrational will find its voices and means of spreading. 
	•	Feeling superior and beyond it is a sure sign that the irrational is at work. (Greene, 2018)
Irrational decision
	•	Losing contact with reality, we make irrational decisions. That is why our success often does not last.  (Greene, 2018)
Irrational people
	•	We constantly feel emotions, and they continually infect our thinking, making us veer toward thoughts that please us and soothe our egos. It is impossible to not have our inclinations and feelings somehow involved in what we think. Rational people are aware of this and through introspection and effort are able, to some extent, to subtract emotions from their thinking and counteract their effect. Irrational people have no such awareness. They rush into action without carefully considering the ramifications and consequences. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Irrational people reveal in their lives negative patterns—mistakes that keep repeating, unnecessary conflicts that follow them wherever they go, dreams and projects that are never realized, anger and desires for change that are never translated into concrete action. They are emotional and reactive and unaware of this. Everyone is capable of irrational decisions, some of which are caused by circumstances beyond our control. (Greene, 2018)
	•	irrational people become highly emotional when challenged about the emotional roots of their decisions. They are incapable of introspection and learning. Their mistakes make them increasingly defensive. (Greene, 2018)
	•	All of us have irrational tendencies. It is the lasting legacy of our primitive origins. We will never get rid of them. We are prone to superstitions, to seeing connections between events that have no connection. We are fascinated by coincidences. We anthropomorphize and project our feelings onto other people and the world around us. We secretly consult astrology charts. We must simply accept this. In fact, we often resort to irrationality as a form of relaxation—silly jokes, meaningless activities, occasional dabbling in the occult. Always being rational can be tiresome. But for some people, this makes them terribly uncomfortable. (Greene, 2018)
Low-grade irrationality 
	•	This is a function of the continual moods and feelings that we experience in life, below the level of consciousness. When we plan or make decisions, we are not aware of how deeply these moods and feelings skew the thinking process. They create in our thinking pronounced biases that are so deeply ingrained in us that we see evidence of them in all cultures and all periods of history. These biases, by distorting reality, lead to the mistakes and ineffective decisions that plague our lives. Being aware of them, we can begin to counterbalance their effects. (Greene, 2018)
High-grade irrationality
	•	This occurs when our emotions become inflamed, generally because of certain pressures. As we think about our anger, excitement, resentment, or suspicion, it intensifies into a reactive state—everything we see or hear is interpreted through the lens of this emotion. We become more sensitive and more prone to other emotional reactions. Impatience and resentment can bleed into anger and deep distrust. These reactive states are what lead people to violence, to manic obsessions, to uncontrollable greed, or to desires to control another person. This form of irrationality is the source of more acute problems—crises, conflicts, and disastrous decisions. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Understanding how this type of irrationality operates can allow us to recognize the reactive state as it is happening and pull back before we do something we regret. (Greene, 2018)
Isolationism
	•	Isolationism – the attempt to defend a “Fortress America”. (Brown, 1983)
IQ test
	•	A person’s intelligence, as measured by IQ tests, has little to do with creativity. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Natural talent or a high IQ cannot explain future achievement. (Greene, 2014)
Iteration
	•	These systems consist of a rule: you put a number in and you get a new number out, which you put back in, to get yet a newer number out, which you put back in. And so on. This process is called iteration. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
	•	to compute the average magnification per iteration we must take a geometric average.Smith, Leonard. Chaos: A Very Short Introduction (Very Short Introductions) . OUP Oxford. Kindle Edition. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
J
Jazz
	•	Jazz or any other musical form is a language, with conventions and vocabulary. And so the extreme paradox is that those who impress the most with their individuality in music are the ones who first completely submerge their character in a long apprenticeship. (Greene, 2014)
Jihad
Global jihad
	•	The jihad is global not because it controls people but for precisely the opposite reason: al-Qaeda is too weak to control its own followers. Its operations have taken on a life of their own which have exceeded its inten- tions. For that reason its operations have become gestures of duty rather than acts of instrumentality, properly speaking (Devji 2007:3−4). (Coker, 2009)
Job
New job
	•	In a new job situation, we are ignorant of the power relationships between people, the psychology of our boss, the rules and procedures that are considered critical for success. We are confused- the knowledge we need in both cases is over our head. (Greene, 2014)
Journalist
	•	Souvent, sans bien s’en rendre compte, les journalistes en arrivent à se faire les relais amplificateurs de « bruits » sans fondement et à participer au renforcement des inquiétudes. (Mannoni, 1985)
Judge
	•	In three classic cases concerned with technical experts, the Supreme Court ruled that judges must serve a ‘‘gatekeeper’’ function to ensure that experts appearing in court proceedings be adequately credentialed, and that expert testimony presented to a jury satisfy what it identified as the criteria of science: namely, that the hypothesis be testable, that it actually have been tested, that it have been subject to peer review, that it have a known or potential error rate, that there be standards controlling the operation of the technique, and that the hypothesis be generally accepted. (Weiss, 2008)
Judgement
	•	Unreliable judgments cannot be valid predictors of anything. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	judgments that answer the wrong question can also be made with high confidence. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	Judgment is the joint product of the available information and what the analyst brings to the analysis of this information. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Webster’s dictionary defines judgment as arriving at a “decision or conclusion on the basis of indications and probabilities when the facts are not clearly ascertained.” (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Judgment is what analysts use to fill gaps in their knowledge. It entails going beyond the available information and is the principal means of coping with uncertainty. It always involves an analytical leap, from the known into the uncertain. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Judgment is an integral part of all intelligence analysis. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	The ultimate nature of judgment remains a mystery. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	The accuracy of an analyst’s judgment depends upon both the accuracy of our mental model (the fourth type of information discussed above) and the accuracy of the values attributed to the key variables in the model (the third type of information discussed above). (Heuer, 1999)
	•	SJT defines judgement as a process which involves the integration of information from a set of cues into a judgement about some distal state of affairs. (Brehmer and Joyce, 1988)
Intuitive judgement
	•	Analysts must consider many items of evidence with different degrees of accuracy and reliability that are related in complex ways with varying degrees of probability to several potential outcomes. Clearly, one cannot make neat mathematical calculations that take all of these probabilistic relationships into account. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	In making intuitive judgments, we unconsciously seek shortcuts for sorting through this maze, and these shortcuts involve some degree of ignoring the uncertainty inherent in less-than-perfectly-reliable information. (Heuer, 1999)
Deferral judgement
	•	The idea-generation phase of analysis should be separated from the idea-evaluation phase, with evaluation deferred until all possible ideas have been brought out. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	This approach runs contrary to the normal procedure of thinking of ideas and evaluating them concurrently. (Heuer, 1999)
Judgmental attitude
	•	A judgmental attitude dampens the imagination, whether it manifests itself as self-censorship of one’s own ideas or fear of critical evaluation by colleagues or supervisors. (Heuer, 1999)
Political judgment
	•	Political judgments are normally couched in imprecise terms and are generally conditional upon other developments. Even in retrospect, there are no objective criteria for evaluating the accuracy of most political intelligence judgments as they are presently written. (Heuer, 1999)
Juror
	•	Les jurés nous fournissent tout d'abord un excellent exemple de la faible importance que présente, au point de vue des décisions, le niveau mental des divers éléments composant une foule.
	•	Comme toutes les foules, les jurés sont très fortement impressionnés par des sentiments et très faiblement par des raisonnements. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Impitoyables aux crimes qui semblent pouvoir les atteindre—et qui sont précisément d'ailleurs les plus redoutables pour la société—les jurés sont au contraire très indulgents pour les crimes dits passionnels. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Les jurys, comme toutes les foules, sont fort éblouis par le prestige, et le président des Glajeux fait justement remarquer que, très démocratiques dans leur composition, ils sont très aristocratiques dans leurs affections: «Le nom, la naissance, la grande fortune, la renommée, l'assistance d'un avocat illustre, les choses qui distinguent et les choses qui reluisent forment un appoint très considérable dans la main des accusés.» (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Agir sur les sentiments des jurés, et, comme avec toutes les foules, raisonner fort peu, ou n'employer que des formes rudimentaires de raisonnement, doit être la préoccupation de tout bon avocat. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	il peut y avoir une infinité de raisons d'avoir envie de condamner un homme, en dehors du sentiment de la justice.» (Lebon, 1895)
	•	pourquoi le discours fait d'avance est d'un effet si nul, puisqu'il faut pouvoir à chaque instant modifier les termes employés suivant l'impression produite. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	L'orateur n'a pas besoin de convertir tous les membres d'un jury, mais seulement les meneurs qui détermineront l'opinion générale. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Comme dans toutes les foules, il y a toujours un petit nombre d'individus qui conduisent les autres. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	jury, seule protection que nous ayons pourtant contre les erreurs vraiment bien fréquentes d'une caste sans contrôle. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Les erreurs des jurés ont toujours été d'abord des erreurs de magistrats. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	L'honorabilité du condamné proclamée par tous ses concitoyens rendait évidente la grossièreté de l'erreur. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Dans toutes les affaires analogues, entourées de détails techniques où il ne peut rien comprendre, le jury écoute naturellement le ministère public, se disant qu'après tout l'affaire a été instruite par des magistrats rompus à toutes les subtilités. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Redoutons la puissance des foules, mais redoutons beaucoup plus encore la puissance de certaines castes. Les premières peuvent se laisser convaincre, les secondes ne fléchissent jamais. (Lebon, 1895)
Justice
	•	La justice et plus exactement la police — que l’on nomme précisément les forces de l’ordre — ont la mission officielle de garantir les biens et les personnes. (Mannoni, 1985)
K
Kaldor compensation test
	•	Kaldor compensation test (after Nicholas Kaldor) sanctions a move from one allocation of resources to another, if the winner could compensate the loser and still be better off. In this case, the compensation does not actually have to be paid (Torriti and Ikpeb, 2014)
Kaldor–Hicks efficiency
	•	Kaldor–Hicks efficiency, an outcome is more efficient if those that are made better off could in theory compensate those that are made worse off (Torriti and Ikpeb, 2014)
Key judgments’
	•	Key judgments’ were introduced some years ago into JIC papers on the same logic, to direct the drafters away from description of the issue towards analysis of its meaning, and to focus attention on answering the questions behind the commissioning of the paper. (Omand, 2014)
	•	Even key judgments can, however, end up so condensed that they become statements of the obvious. No policy-maker needs really to be told that ‘If widespread street rioting continues in country x then the hold of the government on power will be challenged.’ What they want to know is the judgment of the intelligence community on which circumstances might make the challenge successful. (Omand, 2014)
Kind hierarchies
	•	Kind hierarchies are based on the idea that subordinate concepts are a ‘kind of’ in relation to superordinate concepts. (Sottilotta, 2016)
King
	•	Allez, monsieur, dit le roi, et si je vous oubliais – la mémoire des rois est courte. (Dumas, 1998)
	•	Le génie de Napoléon a vaincu : le monarque légitime est le monarque aimé. (Dumas, 1998)
	•	Mais les rois de nos jours, maintenus dans la limite du probable, n'ont plus l'audace de la volonté ; ils craignent l'oreille qui écoute les ordres qu'ils donnent, l'oeil qui scrute leurs actions ; ils ne sentent plus la supériorité de leur essence divine ; ils sont des hommes couronnés, voilà tout. (Dumas, 1998)
Kingdom
	•	Les royaumes des rois sont limités, soit par des montagnes, soit par des rivières, soit par un changement de moeurs, soit par une mutation de langage. (Dumas, 1998)
Know
	•	We can know something only if it is both true and knowable. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	Know is not the only word that fosters this illusion. In common usage, the words intuition and premonition also are reserved for past thoughts that turned out to be true. (Kahneman, 2012)
Knowledge
	•	One measure of knowledge we have used is the individual's self-report of how much he or she knows about specific technologies. Another measure is self-report of educational level. (Wildavsky and Dake, 1990)
	•	Knowledge has become corrigible. (Coker, 2009)
	•	Knowledge is on the move all the time. It is accumulating at a frightening rate. Sometimes it confirms the experts in their opinions, but it can also challenge their professional credibility. (Coker, 2009)
	•	Knowledge is power— sometimes. At other times it proves erroneous, irrelevant, or impotent. The power of knowledge depends on who has it, how accurate it is, and how it can be used (Betts, 2007)
	•	To produce power, knowledge must be not only correct but integrated and communicated effectively to the policymakers and implementers in a position to use it productively—the intelligence “consumers.” Then those consumers who are in a position to turn the knowledge into power must be sure not to misunderstand or misuse it. (Betts, 2007)
	•	Thus the power of knowledge sometimes depends on the intelligence producers’ knowledge of power. This draws intelligence production closer to the policy maelstrom, raising risks of contaminating the product with policy predispositions. (Betts, 2007)
	•	how knowledge is connected in memory is critically important in determining what information is retrieved in response to any stimulus and how that information is used in reasoning. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Knowledge is power; and the ability to define what others will take to be knowledge is the greatest power. (CIA, 1978)
	•	Our knowledge of the world is limited, despite the advances of science. Our ideas are conditioned by the prejudices instilled in us by our parents, by our culture, and by the historical period we live in. They are further limited by the increasing rigidity of the mind. A bit more humility about what we know would make us all more curious and interested in a wider range of ideas. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Knowledge is, in the context of decision making, information that has been analyzed and evaluated for operational implications (ADP 6-0). Knowledge assists in ascribing meaning and value to the conditions or events within an operation. (Army Publishing Directorate, 2020)
	•	Knowledge is part of nature and is subjected to its general laws. (Feyerabend, 1993)
Knowledge gap
	•	And some of us, as indelicate as it might be to say it, are not intelligent enough to know when we’re wrong, no ma er how good our intentions. Just as we are not all equally able to carry a tune or draw a straight line, many people simply cannot recognize the gaps in their own knowledge or understand their own inability to construct a logical argument. (Nichols, 2017)
Knowledge production
	•	Producing knowledge is never a solitary endeavour. A scientist is always ‘a dwarf standing on the shoulders of a giant’, as philosopher Bernard of Chartres is said to have pointed out for the first time in the 12th century. Scientists’ work almost always builds on previous results. Researchers recognize this by citing several older publications at the end of their papers. Citations provide recognition of relevant results of the past, give credibility to new results and make reference to facts, technologies, and experiments that are accepted as valid, or criticized, within a work. Publications have been extensively standardized in recent years: articles are mostly in English, control methods have been homogenized (mainly through peer review), measures of impact have been devised, etc. At the same time, large electronic databases of publications have been established, with thousands of new items being added every day: articles, books, patents, projects, etc. All this produces a large network of publications: two items are connected if one of them cites the other. We can also identify authorship from these databases and create networks of collaborations between scientists. These systems are increasingly used to map and visualize the development of knowledge and the most active areas of science. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
Knowledge theory
	•	The most widely held theory of risk perception we call the knowledge theory: the often implicit notion that people perceivetechnologies (and other things) to be dangerous because they knowthem to be dangerous. (Wildavsky and Dake, 1990)
Good knowledge
	•	experience is not the same thing as good knowledge. Experience can lead usastray.  (Clarke, 1999)
Substantive knowledge
	•	Substantive knowledge and analytical experience determine the store of memories and schemata the analyst draws upon to generate and evaluate hypotheses. The key is not a simple ability to recall facts, but the ability to recall patterns that relate facts to each other and to broader concepts—and to employ procedures that facilitate this process. (Heuer, 1999)
Tacit knowledge
	•	tacit knowledge—a feeling for what you are doing that is hard to put into words but easy to demonstrate in action. (Greene, 2014)
L
Labelling
	•	This view of the social effects of labelling is one that has wide currency today. A prominent twentieth century linguistic conservative, C. S. Lewis, argued (1990 [1967]: 6) for vigilance over usage to prevent 'verbicide': Prolonged thought about the words which we ordinarily use to think with can produce a momentary aphasia. I think it is to be welcomed. It is well we should become aware of what we are doing when we speak, of the ancient, fragile, and (well used) immensely potent instruments that words are.  (Hutton, 1998)
Landsturm 
	•	Landsturm is what we might call a general arming of an entire people for the direct defence of a country.... These are its particulars: all able-bodied men between 17 and 59 who do not serve as regular soldiers are armed and belong to the Landsturm. The arms and equipment are nothing more than a rifle, or if that is not available, a pike or sickle, a backpack to carry a few days’ provisions and some munitions, and a cap cushioned with straw to protect against strikes, and which at the same time carries a badge of the province and the local community. (Clausewitz) (Heuser, 2010a)
Language
	•	Language matters because it constructs the categories by which we understand the world. (Coker, 2009)
	•	Language is a system largely designed for social communication. It is based on conventions that everyone can agree upon. It is somewhat rigid and stable, so that it allows us to communicate with minimum friction. But when it comes to the incredible complexity and fluidity of life, it can often fail us. (Greene, 2014)
	•	Once the original meaning is forgotten, language is set adrift and is moulded by the requirements and aspirations of the people. Language change is to be seen as a response to human needs. Any classification of semantic changes would be a classification of creative and intellectual forces. Language is not an object that exists beyond individual and collective human control and understanding. (Hutton, 1998)
	•	Bréal's linguistic thought wavers between uniformitarianism and an enlightenment view that suggests that languages, like civilisations, progress upwards through human reason. Uniformitarianism is the belief that 'languages at whatever stage of their history have always been subject to the same laws and the same basic conditions, and thus they change now more or less as they changed in ancient times' (Wolf, 1991: 5). (Hutton, 1998)
	•	For Trench, language is 'fossil poetry', 'fossil ethics' and 'fossil history' (1851: 5); and the truth may speak through language in spite of the ignorance of the speaker (1851: 9): But it was said just now that words often contain a witness for great moral truths -- God having impressed such a seal of truth upon language, that men are continually uttering deeper things than they know, asserting mighty principles, it may be asserting them against themselves, in words that to them may seem nothing more than the current coin of society. (Hutton, 1998)
	•	For Trench, as for many contemporary critics of language on both the 'right' and the 'left', language is the battleground between the forces of good and bad as variously defined. (Hutton, 1998)
	•	Language is an instrument for communication. (Hutton, 1998)
	•	Williams argued (1983: 23) that any study of language must recognise the 'community between past and present, but also that community -- that difficult word -- is not the only possible description of these relations between past and present; that there are also radical change, discontinuity and conflict.' Williams hoped by his study to add an 'extra edge of consciousness' to the complexities and contradictions of the inherited linguistic traditions. (Hutton, 1998)
	•	The language that is presented to us as a whole to be learned and used could become a self-conscious instrument subject to human individual and collective will. (Hutton, 1998)
	•	questions about the emergence and persistence of distinct languages and dialects fit this format. It is plausible that dialects induce boundaries of trust, making a distinction between ‘us’ and ‘them’. This, of course, depends upon the agents’ rules and how, in an almost geographic sense, they form groups. (Holland, 2014)
	•	From the CAS point of view, languages set boundaries on communication between human agents. Within the gated urn framework, one can model and examine the plausibility of the hypothesis that a shared language, or dialect, sets boundaries of trusts. (Holland, 2014)
Language evolution
	•	The network of words changes as speakers change, and as the overall language evolves, introducing neologisms and new semantic relations. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
Imperfection of language
	•	The 'imperfection' of language is its key quality, since it is flexible and open to change (1964 [1897]: 245-246): [...] a philosophical language such as has often been planned, a language resulting from a system, in which each word should remain for ever delimited by its definition, and in which the affinity of words should be traced from the real or imagined connection of ideas, -- such a language may indeed be suitable for a few special sciences, like chemistry, but if applied to human thought, with its fluctuations and its progressions, could not fail to become, in the course of time, a hindrance and a restraint. In proportion as the experience of the human race increases, Language, thanks to its elasticity, acquires new meaning. (Hutton, 1998)
Language of organizational justification 
	•	The language of organizational justification consists in being able to demonstrate conformity to standardized elements of a risk management system, such as objectives setting, risk identification, controls design, and risk appetite. These elements may be idealizations and grounded on poor organizational theory, but they delineate a conceptual framework for presenting and describing choice and decision. (Power, 2009)
Language of rights
	•	The very language of tights may confuse moral categories with strategic goals. In some controversies claims to rights are little more than ad hoc responses in competitive situations. (Nelkin, 1992)
Language of risk
	•	The language of risk is reserved as a specialized lexical register for political talk about the undesirable outcomes (Douglas, 2005)
	•	The language of risk is not new – it has been part of the modern experience from the beginning but for much of the time it has been inescapably ‘social’. (Coker, 2009)
	•	the language and method of risk analysis is also applied not only to the way we conceive war but also the way in which we conduct it. (Coker, 2009)
Language structure
	•	Recently, there has emerged a new family of approaches to language structure that vary from one another in a number of ways but that are united in their rejection of the Autonomy of Syntax position. They are called either Cognitive Linguistics or Functional Linguistics. (Tomasello, 1998)
Latent side effect
	•	‘latent side effect’ which simultaneously admits and legitimates the reality of the hazard. (Beck, 1992)
	•	‘latent side effect’ thus stands for a type of license, a natural fate of civilization, which simultaneously confesses to, selectively distributes and justifies undesirable consequences. (Beck, 1992)
	•	‘latent side effects’ strike back even at the centres of their production (Beck, 1992)

Lay members 
	•	Lay members, it is thought, will help make expert advice more legitimate and encourage greater public confidence in the decisions of government. (Stilgoe et al., 2006)
	•	Lay members are often asked to help make difficult scientific discussions accessible to the public and to policy-makers, providing a bridge between experts and non-expert (Stilgoe et al., 2006)
	•	lay member is cast as a ‘public witness’ to the committee. They may be neutral or explicitly representative, speaking on behalf of certain public interests. ‘Lay’, in this sense, does not refer to their qualities as an expert, or non-expert, but whom they speak for – ‘the man on the street’, as one participant put it (Stilgoe et al., 2006)
	•	lay member is seen as a conduit through which the public can ensure that the committee is acting in an appropriate manner (Stilgoe et al., 2006)
	•	‘lay experts’ might be able to help scientists situate their advice in a policy context. (Stilgoe et al., 2006)
	•	Lay membership can be an important way of opening up the inputs of expertise, broadening the questions that get asked and the voices that get heard. (Stilgoe et al., 2006)
	•	A lay member can ask some difficult questions, which may be important but may not be obvious (Stilgoe et al., 2006)

Lay people
	•	Lay people’s ability to respond to an environmental hazard is determined, in part, by their understanding of the physical, chemical, and biological processes that govern its creation and control. (Bostrom et al., 1992)

Lay roles
	•	Lay roles, and the wider potential of lay members, depend on the expectations policy-makers have of scientific advice (Stilgoe et al., 2006)
Law
	•	Laws, like Newton’s laws of gravity or Maxwell’s laws of electromagnetism, are the counterpart of the rules of chess. States, such as the state of an economy, are the counterpart of particular configurations of pieces on the chessboard. As in chess, the laws determine the ways in which the states can change over time. In complex physical systems, laws constrain the way in which a given initial state can change. (Holland, 2014)
	•	The term ‘law’ here has a misleading air of finality. All scientific laws are provisional: approximations that are valid to a high degree of accuracy and are used until something better comes along. (Stewart, 2013)
	•	One of the most intriguing features of the laws of Nature, as we understand them, is that they are symmetric. As we saw in the previous chapter, symmetry of the equations (laws) need not imply symmetry of the behaviour (solutions). (Stewart, 2013)
Law of least effort
	•	A general “law of least effort” applied to cognitive as well as physical exertion. The law asserts that if there are several ways of achieving the same goal, people will eventually gravitate to the least demanding course of action. In the economy of action, effort is a cost, and the acquisition of skill is driven by the balance of benefits and costs. (Kahneman, 2012)
Law of small numbers
	•	"law of small numbers," according to which even small samples are highly representative of the populations from which they are drawn. (Tversky and Kahneman, 1974)
	•	expectation that a valid hypothesis about a population will be represented by a statistically significant result in a sample—with little regard for its size. (Tversky and Kahneman, 1974)
	•	his bias leads to the selection of samples of inadequate size and to over interpretation of findings. (Tversky and Kahneman, 1974)
	•	extreme outcomes (both high and low) are more likely to be found in small than in large samples (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	The law of small numbers is a manifestation of a general bias that favors certainty over doubt (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	the law of small numbers is part of two larger stories about the workings of the mind. The exaggerated faith in small samples is only one example of a more general illusion—we pay more attention to the content of messages than to information about their reliability, and as a result end up with a view of the world around us that is simpler and more coherent than the data justify. Jumping to conclusions is a safer sport in the world of our imagination than it is in reality. Statistics produce many observations that appear to beg for causal explanations but do not lend themselves to such explanations. Many facts of the world are due to chance, including accidents of sampling. Causal explanations of chance events are inevitably wrong. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	Such problems are most likely to arise in intelligence analysis when analysts have little information, say on political attitudes of Russian military officers or among certain African ethnic groups. If the available evidence is consistent, analysts will often overlook the fact that it represents a very small and hence unreliable sample taken from a large and heterogeneous group. This is not simply a matter of necessity—of having to work with the information on hand, however imperfect it may be. Rather, there is an illusion of validity caused by the consistency of the information.(Heuer, 1999)
	•	The tendency to place too much reliance on small samples has been dubbed the “law of small numbers.” (Heuer, 1999)
Law of large numbers
	•	the basic statistical principle that says very large samples will be highly representative of the population from which they are drawn. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	En supposant que les risques sont identi- quement distribués, la loi des grands nombres stipule que la moyenne d’un échantillon s’approche de la vraie moyenne (la moyenne de la population) à mesure que la taille de l’échantillon augmente. Selon cette théorie, la perte espérée est relativement facile à prédire. (Dumont, 2011)
Leader
	•	The leader infects the group with his mind-set. Much of this occurs on the nonverbal level, as people pick up on the leader’s body language and tone of voice. (Greene, 2018)
	•	The leader will tend to impose a form of nonverbal communication on the group in very subtle ways. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Alpha males like to signal their superior position in the rank in several ways: They speak faster than others and feel entitled to interrupt and control the flow of the conversation. Their handshake is extra vigorous, almost crushing. When they walk in the office, you will see them assume a taller stance and a purposeful stride, generally making inferiors walk behind them. Watch chimpanzees in a zoo and you will notice similar behavior on the part of the alpha chimp. (Greene, 2018)
	•	It is worth observing those in positions of power in your group for signs of dominance cues and for their absence. Leaders who display tension and hesitation in their nonverbal cues are generally insecure in their power and feel it threatened. Signs of such anxiety and insecurity are generally easy to spot. They will talk in a more halting manner, with long pauses. Their voice will rise in pitch and stay there. They will tend to avert their gaze and control their eye movements, although they will often blink more. They will put on more forced smiles and emit nervous laughs. As opposed to feeling entitled to touch others, they will tend to touch themselves in what is known as pacifying behavior. They will touch their hair, their neck, their forehead, all in an attempt to soothe their nerves. People trying to hide their insecurities will assert themselves a little too loudly in a conversation, their voices rising. As they do this, they look around nervously, eyes wide open. Or as they talk in an animated way, their hands and bodies are unusually still, always a sign of anxiety. They will inevitably give off mixed signals, and you must pay greater attention to those that signal underlying insecurity. (Greene, 2018)
	•	With leaders who are riddled with insecurities that poke through nonverbally, you can play to their insecurities and gain power through this, but often it is best to avoid attaching yourself too closely to such types, as they tend to do poorly over time and can drag you down with them. (Greene, 2018)
	•	how people handle power and responsibility will tell you a lot about them. (Greene, 2018)
	•	On the way to gaining power, people will tend to play the courtier, to seem deferential, to follow the party line, to do what it takes to make it to the top. Once at the top, there are fewer restraints and they will often reveal something about themselves you had not noticed before. Some people stay true to the values they had before attaining a high position—they remain respectful and empathetic. On the other hand, far more people suddenly feel entitled to treat others differently now that they have the power. (Greene, 2018)
	•	you need to take notice of what people reveal once they are in power. So often we think that power has changed people, when in fact it simply reveals more of who they are. (Greene, 2018)
	•	People still tend to idealize leaders and worship them, and you must see this as a form of grandiosity. By believing someone else will make everything great, followers can feel something of this greatness. Their minds can soar along with the rhetoric of the leader. They can feel superior to those who are not believers. On a more personal level, people will often idealize those they love, elevating them to god or goddess status and by extension feeling some of this power reflected back on them. (Greene, 2018)
	•	When it comes to leaders, we generally don’t see them as ordinary people. We tend to feel somewhat awed and intimidated in their presence, as if they possessed some mythical extra powers. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Any type of court obviously revolves around the leader, the courtiers’ power depending on the relative closeness of their relationship with this leader. Although leaders come in many varieties, one dynamic is fairly universal: the courtiers (minus the cynical types, see below) will tend to idealize those in power. They will see their leaders as smarter, cleverer, more perfect than is the reality. This will make it easier for them to justify their fawning behavior. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Leaders are often in a difficult position. They have to bear the responsibility for what happens to the group and thestress that goes with that. At the same time, they must maintain a reputation that is above reproach. More than others, they have to keep their Shadow side (see chapter 9) under wraps. This could be extramarital desires they have had to repress, or paranoia about the loyalty of everyone around them, or the craving to do some violence against a hated enemy. Unconsciously their Shadow is yearning to come out. (Greene, 2018)
	•	With leaders, you must be aware of their idealized opinion of themselves and always confirm it in some way, or even encourage them to live up to it. Those on top are lonelier and more insecure than you imagine, and they will lap this up. (Greene, 2018)
	•	the Favorite’s rise in power is often based on cultivating a more personal, friend-like relationship. Early on, they act relaxed and chummy with the leader, without seeming disrespectful. Many leaders are secretly dying to not have to be so formal and in control. Sometimes leaders who are lonely will pick out one person to occupy this position. With the Favorite, they will gladly share secrets and bestow favors. This, of course, will stir up the envy of other courtiers. (Greene, 2018)
	•	When leaders fail to establish these twin pillars of authority—vision and empathy—what often happens is the following: Those in the group feel the disconnect and distance between them and leadership. They know that deep down they are viewed as replaceable pawns. They sense the overall lack of direction and the constant tactical reactions to events. And so, in subtle ways, they begin to feel resentful and to lose respect. They listen less attentively to what such leaders say. They spend more hours in the day thinking of their own interests and future. They join or form factions. They work at half or three-quarter speed. (Greene, 2018)
	•	If such leaders, sensing all of this, become more forceful and demanding, the members become more passive-aggressive. If the leaders become pliant and plead for more support, the members feel even less respect, as if the group were now leading the leader. In this way, the members create endless forms of friction for leaders, who might now feel like they have to drag the group up a hill. This friction, caused by their own inattentiveness, is why so many leaders get so little done and are so mediocre. (Greene, 2018)
	•	you must not fall for the counterproductive prejudices of the times we live in, in which the very concept of authority is often misunderstood and despised. Today we confuse authority with leaders in general, and since so many of them in the world seem more interested in preserving their power and enriching themselves, naturally we have doubts about the very concept itself. We also live in fiercely democratic times. “Why should we ever have to follow a person of authority, and assume such an inferior role?” we might ask ourselves. “People in power should simply get the job done; authority is a relic of kings and queens. We have progressed far beyond that.” (Greene, 2018)
	•	As the leader, you must be seen working as hard as or even harder than everyone else. You set the highest standards for yourself. You are consistent and accountable. If there are sacrifices that need to be made, you are the first to make them for the good of the group. This sets the proper tone. The members will feel compelled to raise themselves up to your level and gain your approval, much like Elizabeth’s ministers. They will internalize your values and subtly imitate you. You will not have to yell and lecture them to make them work harder. They will want to. (Greene, 2018)
	•	by sending mixed signals, by showing qualities that are ever so slightly contrary, you cause people to pause in their instant categorizations and to think about who you really are. The more they think about you, the larger and more authoritative your presence. (Greene, 2018)
	•	l’attachement sentimental des individus pour leur chef s’explique par un investissement libidinal. Pour le reste, l’inconscient est différemment défini chez l’un et l’autre auteur, le père de la psychanalyse ne voulant pas y voir autre chose que le refoulé. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	En fait, la masse semble parcourue par les courants idéologiques que font passer à travers elle, comme de grands frissons, les catalyseurs de masses, les meneurs. Avec eux commence le drame de la masse, séduite ou terrorisée. Elle devient ainsi l’otage du leader qui, sous l’alibi de l’administration gouvernementale, va tirer les ficelles. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Il n’y a, en effet, de masse, pourrait-on dire en manière de formule, que parce qu’il y a des chefs ou des meneurs. Ce sont eux qui assemblent et mobilisent : ils catalysent la foule et la dynamisent. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	les masses affligées ou mécontentes se sont laissé séduire par la vision eschatologique d’un prophète quelconque. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Les foules adorent ces êtres habités par l’esprit de Dieu et sont prêtes à les suivre dans les plus folles entreprises. Par leur seule présence, ces thaumaturges, incarnations du Père idéal en langage psychanalytique, se sont révélés capables de provoquer des enthousiasmes tels que leurs adeptes ont marché au combat et à la mort en les glorifiant. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	En fait, le « grand homme » semble posséder un pouvoir attractif, émanant naturellement de sa personne, sorte de « rayonnement », que Le Bon baptisait « prestige » et que l’on a nommé, à la suite de Max Weber, le charisme. Il est commun depuis d’avoir du chef charismatique une représentation relevant des images d’Epinal. On le voit dressé au milieu de l’histoire de son peuple comme un Guide providentiel, figure de proue mystérieuse et inspirée : il s’avance auréolé de lumière, possédant des qualités quasi divines. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Pelz propose trois éléments permettant d’évaluer le pouvoir de superviseur : la capacité qu’il pense avoir d’agir sur les décisions de son supérieur, sa propre autonomie décisionnelle et son niveau de salaire.

	•	les meneurs comme des catalyseurs de masses. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	les maîtres du monde, tous les fondateurs de religions ou d'empires, les apôtres de toutes les croyances, les hommes d'État éminents, et, dans une sphère plus modeste, les simples chefs de petites collectivités humaines, ont toujours été des psychologues inconscients. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Le merveilleux et le légendaire sont les vrais supports des civilisations.—L'imagination populaire a toujours été la base de la puissance des hommes d'État. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Une des fonctions les plus essentielles des hommes d'État consiste donc à baptiser de mots populaires, ou au moins neutres, les choses que les foules ne peuvent supporter avec leurs anciens noms. La puissance des mots est si grande qu'il suffit de désigner par des termes bien choisis les choses les plus odieuses pour les faire accepter des foules. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	L'art des gouvernants, comme celui des avocats, consiste surtout à savoir manier les mots. Une des grandes difficultés de cet art est que, dans une même société, les mêmes mots ont le plus souvent des sens fort différents pour les diverses couches sociales. Elles emploient en apparence les mêmes mots; mais elles ne parlent jamais la même langue. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Dès qu'un certain nombre d'êtres vivants sont réunis, qu'il s'agisse d'un troupeau d'animaux ou d'une foule d'hommes, ils se placent d'instinct sous l'autorité d'un chef. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Dans les foules humaines, le chef n'est souvent qu'un meneur, mais, comme tel, il joue un rôle considérable. Sa volonté est le noyau autour duquel se forment et s'identifient les opinions. Il constitue le premier élément d'organisation des foules hétérogènes et prépare leur organisation en sectes. En attendant, il les dirige. La foule est un troupeau servile qui ne saurait jamais se passer de maître. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Le meneur a d'abord été le plus souvent un mené. Il a lui-même été hypnotisé par l'idée dont il est ensuite devenu l'apôtre. Elle l'a envahi au point que tout disparaît en dehors d'elle, et que toute opinion contraire lui paraît erreur et superstition. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Les meneurs ne sont pas le plus souvent des hommes de pensée, mais des hommes d'action. Ils sont peu clairvoyants, et ne pourraient l'être, la clairvoyance conduisant généralement au doute et à l'inaction. Ils se recrutent surtout parmi ces névrosés, ces excités, ces demi-aliénés qui côtoient les bords de la folie. Quelque absurde que puisse être l'idée qu'ils défendent ou le but qu'ils poursuivent, tout raisonnement s'émousse contre leur conviction. Le mépris et les persécutions ne les touchent pas, ou ne font que les exciter davantage. Intérêt personnel, famille, tout est sacrifié. L'instinct de la conservation lui-même est annulé chez eux, au point que la seule récompense qu'ils sollicitent souvent est de devenir des martyrs. L'intensité de leur foi donne à leurs paroles une grande puissance suggestive. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	La multitude est toujours prête à écouter l'homme doué de volonté forte qui sait s'imposer à elle. Les hommes réunis en foule perdent toute volonté et se tournent d'instinct vers qui en possède une. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	De meneurs, les peuples n'ont jamais manqué: mais il s'en faut que tous soient animés des convictions fortes qui font les apôtres. Ce sont souvent des rhéteurs subtils, ne poursuivant que des intérêts personnels et cherchant à persuader en flattant de bas instincts. L'influence qu'ils exercent ainsi peut être très grande, mais elle reste toujours très éphémère. Les grands convaincus qui ont soulevé l'âme des foules, les Pierre l'Ermite, les Luther, les Savonarole, les hommes de la Révolution, n'ont exercé de fascination qu'après avoir été eux-mêmes d'abord fascinés par une croyance. Ils purent alors créer dans les âmes cette puissance formidable nommée la foi, qui rend l'homme esclave absolu de son rêve. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	De toutes les forces dont l'humanité dispose, la foi a toujours été une des plus grandes, et c'est avec raison que l'Évangile lui attribue le pouvoir de transporter les montagnes. Donner à l'homme une foi, c'est décupler sa force. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Ils forment le sommet d'une série continue descendant de ces puissants manieurs d'hommes à l'ouvrier qui, dans une auberge fumeuse, fascine lentement ses camarades en remâchant sans cesse quelques formules qu'il ne comprend guère, mais dont, selon lui, l'application doit amener sûrement la réalisation de tous les rêves et de toutes les espérances. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Dans toutes les sphères sociales, des plus hautes aux plus basses, dès que l'homme n'est plus isolé, il tombe bientôt sous la loi d'un meneur. La plupart des hommes, dans les masses populaires surtout, ne possèdent, en dehors de leur spécialité, d'idée nette et raisonnée sur quoi que ce soit. Ils sont incapables de se conduire. Le meneur leur sert de guide. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	procurent ces phrases toutes faites qui dispensent de raisonner. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	L'autorité des meneurs est très despotique, et n'arrive même à s'imposer qu'à cause de ce despotisme. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Les meneurs tendent aujourd'hui à remplacer de plus en plus les pouvoirs publics à mesure que ces derniers se laissent discuter et affaiblir. La tyrannie de ces nouveaux maîtres fait que les foules leur obéissent beaucoup plus docilement qu'elles n'ont obéi à aucun gouvernement. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Si, par suite d'un accident quelconque, le meneur disparaît et n'est pas immédiatement remplacé, la foule redevient une collectivité sans cohésion ni résistance. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Ce n'est pas le besoin de la liberté, mais celui de la servitude qui domine toujours dans l'âme des foules. Elles ont une telle soif d'obéir qu'elles se soumettent d'instinct à qui se déclare leur maître. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	On peut établir une division assez tranchée dans la classe des meneurs. Les uns sont des hommes énergiques, à volonté forte, mais momentanée; les autres, beaucoup plus rares que les précédents, sont des hommes possédant une volonté à la fois forte et durable. Les premiers sont violents, braves, hardis. Ils sont utiles surtout pour diriger un coup de main, entraîner les masses malgré le danger, et transformer en héros les recrues de la veille. Tels, par exemple, Ney et Murat, sous le premier Empire. Tel encore, de nos jours, Garibaldi, aventurier sans talent, mais énergique, réussissant avec une poignée d'hommes à s'emparer de l'ancien royaume de Naples défendu pourtant par une armée disciplinée. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Mais si l'énergie de ces meneurs est puissante, elle est momentanée et ne survit guère à l'excitant qui l'a fait naître. Rentrés dans le courant de la vie ordinaire, les héros qui en étaient animés font souvent preuve, comme ceux que je citais à l'instant, de la plus étonnante faiblesse. Ils semblent incapables de réfléchir et de se conduire dans les circonstances les plus simples, alors qu'ils avaient si bien su conduire les autres. Ce sont des meneurs qui ne peuvent exercer leur fonction qu'à la condition d'être menés eux-mêmes et excités sans cesse, d'avoir toujours au-dessus d'eux un homme ou une idée, de suivre une ligne de conduite bien tracée. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	La seconde catégorie des meneurs, celle des hommes à volonté durable, a, malgré des formes moins brillantes, une influence beaucoup plus considérable. En elle on trouve les vrais fondateurs de religions ou de grandes œuvres: saint Paul, Mahomet, Christophe Colomb, Lesseps. Qu'ils soient intelligents ou bornés, il n'importe, le monde sera toujours à eux. La volonté persistante qu'ils possèdent est une faculté infiniment rare et infiniment forte qui fait tout plier. On ne se rend pas toujours suffisamment compte de ce que peut une volonté forte et continue: rien ne lui résiste, ni la nature, ni les dieux, ni les hommes. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	le meneur doué d'un prestige suffisant possède-t-il un pouvoir presque absolu. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Il est rare qu'un meneur précède l'opinion; presque toujours il se borne à la suivre et à en épouser toutes les erreurs. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Les moyens de persuasion des meneurs, en dehors du prestige, sont les facteurs que nous avons déjà énumérés plusieurs fois. Pour les manier habilement, le meneur doit avoir pénétré, au moins d'une façon inconsciente, la psychologie des foules, et savoir comment leur parler. Il doit surtout connaître la fascinante influence des mots, des formules et des images. Il doit posséder une éloquence spéciale, composée: d'affirmations énergiques—dégagées de preuves—et d'images impressionnantes encadrées de raisonnements fort sommaires. C'est un genre d'éloquence qu'on rencontre dans toutes les assemblées, y compris le parlement anglais, le plus pondéré pourtant de tous. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Les meneurs ont tout intérêt à verser dans les plus invraisemblables exagérations. L'orateur, dont je viens de citer une phrase, a pu affirmer, sans soulever de grandes protestations, que les banquiers et les prêtres soudoyaient les lanceurs de bombes, et que les administrateurs des grandes compagnies financières méritent les mêmes peines que les anarchistes. Sur les foules, de pareilles affirmations agissent toujours. L'affirmation n'est jamais trop furieuse, ni la déclamation trop menaçante. Rien n'intimide plus les auditeurs que cette éloquence. En protestant, ils craignent de passer pour traîtres ou complices. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Le meneur peut être quelquefois intelligent et instruit; mais cela lui est généralement plus nuisible qu'utile. En montrant la complexité des choses, en permettant d'expliquer et de comprendre, l'intelligence rend toujours indulgent, et émousse fortement l'intensité et la violence des convictions nécessaires aux apôtres. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Les grands meneurs de tous les âges, ceux de la Révolution surtout, ont été lamentablement bornés; et ce sont justement les plus bornés qui ont exercé la plus grande influence. (Lebon, 1895)
Leader attitude
	•	We humans are self-absorbed by nature and spend most of our time focusing inwardly on our emotions, on our wounds, on our fantasies. You want to develop the habit of reversing this as much as possible. You do this in three ways. First, you hone your listening skills, absorbing yourself in the words and nonverbal cues of others. You train yourself to read between the lines of what people are saying. You attune yourself to their moods and their needs, and sense what they are missing. You do not take people’s smiles and approving looks for reality but rather sense the underlying tension or fascination.Second, you dedicate yourself to earning people’s respect. You do not feel entitled to it; your focus is not on your feelings and what people owe you because of your position and greatness (an inward turn). You earn their respect by respecting their individual needs andby proving that you are working for the greater good. Third, you consider being a leader a tremendous responsibility, the welfare of the group hanging on your every decision. What drives you is not getting attention but bringing about the best results possible for the most people. You absorb yourself in the work, not your ego. You feel a deep and visceral connection to the group, seeing your fate and theirs as deeply intertwined. (Greene, 2018)
Characteristic of leader
	•	First and foremost, we must understand the fundamental task of any leader—to provide a far-reaching vision, to see the global picture, to work for the greater good of the group and maintain its unity. That is what people crave in their leaders. We have to avoid ever seeming petty, self-serving, or indecisive. Showing signs of that will stir up the ambivalence. Focusing on the future and the larger picture should consume much of our thinking. Based on this vision, we must set practical goals and guide the group toward them. We need to become masters of this visionary process through practice and experience. Attaining such mastery will give us tremendous confidence in ourselves, as opposed to the fake confidence of those who are merely grandiose. And when we exude this confidence, people will be drawn to us and want to follow our lead. (Greene, 2018)
	•	When leaders fail to establish these twin pillars of authority—vision and empathy—what often happens is the following: Those in the group feel the disconnect and distance between them and leadership. They know that deep down they are viewed as replaceable pawns. They sense the overall lack of direction and the constant tactical reactions to events. And so, in subtle ways, they begin to feel resentful and to lose respect. They listen less attentively to what such leaders say. They spend more hours in the day thinking of their own interests and future. They join or form factions. They work at half or three-quarter speed. (Greene, 2018)
	•	If such leaders, sensing all of this, become more forceful and demanding, the members become more passive-aggressive. If the leaders become pliant and plead for more support, the members feel even less respect, as if the group were now leading the leader. In this way, the members create endless forms of friction for leaders, who might now feel like they have to drag the group up a hill. This friction, caused by their own inattentiveness, is why so many leaders get so little done and are so mediocre. (Greene, 2018)
Charismatic leader
	•	We must be especially careful around those who have charismatic appeal, and try to demystify and pull them down to earth. With such awareness, we can begin to resist and detach. (Greene, 2018)
	•	En fait, le « grand homme » semble posséder un pouvoir attractif, émanant naturellement de sa personne, sorte de « rayonnement », que Le Bon baptisait « prestige » et que l’on a nommé, à la suite de Max Weber, le charisme. Il est commun depuis d’avoir du chef charismatique une représentation relevant des images d’Epinal. On le voit dressé au milieu de l’histoire de son peuple comme un Guide providentiel, figure de proue mystérieuse et inspirée : il s’avance auréolé de lumière, possédant des qualités quasi divines. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Le troisième facteur, qui est de loin le plus important pour G. Le Bon, c’est la « suggestibilité » (ibid.). Croyant s’engager alors sur le terrain ferme de la physiologie, il postule la quasi-identité de l’état de l’individu en foule avec l’état hypnotique. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Il n’est plus lui-même, mais un automate que sa volonté est devenue impuissante à guider ». (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	le manieur d’hommes qui exerce sur chacun une fascination que Le Bon appelle « la séduction ». C’est une autre manière de nommer le charisme des meneurs dont nous avons déjà parlé. (Mannoni, 1985)
Intelligent leader
	•	Le meneur peut être quelquefois intelligent et instruit; mais cela lui est généralement plus nuisible qu'utile. En montrant la complexité des choses, en permettant d'expliquer et de comprendre, l'intelligence rend toujours indulgent, et émousse fortement l'intensité et la violence des convictions nécessaires aux apôtres. (Lebon, 1895)
Grandiose leader
	•	If people with high levels of grandiosity also possess some talent and a lot of assertive energy, they can rise to positions of great power. Their boldness and confidence attract attention and give them a larger-than- life presence. Mesmerized by their image, we often fail to see the underlying irrationality in their decision-making process and so follow them straight into some disaster. They can be very destructive. (Greene, 2018)
	•	You must realize a simple fact about these types—they depend on the attention we give them. Without our attention, without being adored by the public, they cannot have their high self-opinion validated, and in such cases the very confidence they depend on withers. To awe us and distract us from the reality, they employ certain theatrical devices. It is imperative for us to see through their stage tricks, to demythologize them and scale them back down to humansize. In doing so, we can resist their allure and avoid the dangers they represent. (Greene, 2018)
	•	I am destined. Grandiose leaders often try to give the impression that they were somehow destined for greatness. They tell stories of their childhood and youth that indicate their uniqueness, as if fate had singled them out. They highlight events that showed from early on their unusual toughness or creativity, either making such stories up or reinterpreting the past. They relate tales from earlier in their career in which they overcame impossible odds. The future great leader was already in gestation at a young age, or so they make it seem. (Greene, 2018)
	•	When you hear such things you must become skeptical. They are trying to forge a myth, which they themselves probably have come to believe in. Look for the more mundane facts behind the tales of destiny and, if possible, publicize them. (Greene, 2018)
	•	I’m the common man/woman. In some cases grandiose leaders may have risen from the lower classes, but in general they either come from relatively privileged backgrounds or because of their success have lived removed from the cares of everyday people for quite some time. Nevertheless it is absolutely essential to present themselves to the public as highly representative of the average man and woman out there. Only through such a presentation can they attract the attention and the adoration of large enough numbers to satisfy themselves. (Greene, 2018)
	•	The trick grandiose leaders play is to place the emphasis on their cultural tastes, not on the actual class they come from. They may fly first class and wear the most expensive suits, but they counteract thisby seeming to have the same culinary tastes as the public, enjoy the same movies as others, and avoid at all costs the whiff of cultural elitism. In fact, they will go out of their way to ridicule the elites, even though they probably depend on such experts to guide them. They are simply just like the common folk out there, but with a lot more money and power. The public can now identify with them despite the obvious contradictions. But the grandiosity of this goes beyond merely gaining more attention. These leaders become vastly enlarged by this identification with the masses. They are not merely one man or woman but embody an entire nation or interest group. To follow them is to be loyal to the group itself. To criticize them is to want to crucify the leader and betray the cause. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Even in the prosaic corporate world of business we find such religious-style identification: Eisner, for instance, liked to present himself as embodying the entire Disney spirit, whatever that meant. If you notice such paradoxes and primitive forms of popular association, stand back and analyze the reality of what is going on. You will find at the core something quasi-mystical, highly irrational, and quite dangerous in that the grandiose leader now feels licensed to do whatever he or she wants in the name of the public. (Greene, 2018)
	•	I will deliver you. These types often rise to power in times of trouble and crisis. Their self-confidence is comforting to the public or to shareholders. They will be the ones to deliver the people from the many problems they are facing. In order to pull this off, their promises have to be large yet vague. By being large they can inspire dreams; by being vague, nobody can hold the person to account if they don’t come to pass, since there are no specifics to get hold of. The more grandiose the promises and visions of the future, the more grandiose the faith they will inspire. The message must be simple to digest, reducible to a slogan, and promising something large that stirs the emotions. As part of this strategy these types require convenient scapegoats, often the elites or outsiders, to tighten the group identification and to stir the emotions even further. The movement around the leader begins to crystallize around hatred of these scapegoats, who begin to stand for every bit of pain and injustice each person in the crowd has ever experienced. The leader’s promise to bring these invented enemies down increases the leader’s power exponentially. (Greene, 2018)
	•	What you will find here is that they are creating a cult more than leading a political movement or a business. You will see that theirname, image, and slogans must be reproduced in large numbers and assume a godlike ubiquity. Certain colors, symbols, and perhaps music are used to bind the group identity and appeal to the basest human instincts. People who now believe in the cult are doubly mesmerized and ready to excuse any kind of action. At such a point nothing will dissuade true believers, but you must maintain your internal distance and analytic powers. (Greene, 2018)
	•	I rewrite the rules. A secret wish of humans is to do without the usual rules and conventions in place in any field—to gain power just by following our own inner light. When grandiose leaders claim to have such powers, we are secretly excited and wish to believe them. (Greene, 2018)
	•	grandiose leaders will often rely on their intuitions, disregarding the need for focus groups or any form of scientific feedback. They have a special inside connection to the truth. They like to create the myth that their hunches have led to fantastic successes, but close scrutiny will reveal that their hunches miss as often as they hit. When you hear leaders present themselves as the consummate maverick, able to do away with rules and science, you must see this only as a sign of madness, not divine inspiration. (Greene, 2018)
	•	I have the golden touch. Those with heightened grandiosity will try to create the legend that they have never really failed. If there were failures or setbacks in their career, it was always the fault of others who betrayed them. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Related to this is the belief that they can easily transfer their skills— a movie executive can become a theme park designer, a businessman can become the leader of a nation. Because they are magically gifted, they can try their hand at anything that attracts them. This is often a fatal move on their part, as they attempt things beyond their expertise and quickly become overwhelmed with the complexity and chaos that come from their lack of experience. (Greene, 2018)
	•	In dealing with such types, look carefully at their record and notice how many glaring failures they have had. Although people under the influence of their grandiosity will probably not listen, publicize the truth of their record in as neutral a manner as possible. (Greene, 2018)
	•	I’m invulnerable. The grandiose leader takes risks. This is what often attracts attention in the first place, and combined with the success that often attends the bold, they seem larger than life. But this boldness is not really under control. They must take actions that create a splash in order to keep the attention coming that feeds their high self-opinion. They cannot rest or retreat, because that would cause a lapse in publicity. To make things worse, they come to feel invulnerable because so many times in the past they have gotten away with risky maneuvers, and if they faced setbacks, they managed to overcome them through more audacity. Furthermore, these daring activities make them feel alive and on edge. It becomes a drug. They need bigger stakes and rewards to maintain the feeling of godlike invulnerability. They can work twenty hours a day when under this form of pressure. They can walk through fire. (Greene, 2018)
	•	In fact they are rather invulnerable, until that fatal hubristic maneuver in which they finally go too far and it all crashes down. This could be MacArthur’s grandiose tour of the United States after the Korean War, in which his irrational need for attention became painfully apparent; or Mao’s fatal decision to unleash the CulturalRevolution; or Stan O’Neal, CEO of Merrill Lynch, sticking with mortgage-backed securities when everyone else was getting out, essentially destroying one of the oldest financial institutions in the country. Suddenly the aura of being invulnerable is shattered. This occurs because their decisions are determined not by rational considerations but by the need for attention and glory, and eventually reality catches up, in one hard blow. (Greene, 2018)
	•	In general, in dealing with the grandiose leader, you want to try to deflate the sacred, glorious image they have forged. They will overreact and their followers will become rabid, but slowly a few followers may have second thoughts. Creating a viral disenchantment is your best hope. (Greene, 2018)

	•	Il est quelquefois effrayant de songer au pouvoir que donne à un homme possédant du prestige une conviction forte unie à une extrême étroitesse d'esprit. Il faut pourtant réaliser ces conditions pour ignorer les obstacles et savoir vouloir. D'instinct les foules reconnaissent dans ces convaincus énergiques le maître qu'il leur faut toujours. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Dans une assemblée parlementaire, le succès d'un discours dépend presque uniquement du prestige que l'orateur possède, et pas du tout des raisons qu'il propose. Et, la meilleure preuve, c'est que lorsqu'une cause quelconque fait perdre à un orateur son prestige, il perd du même coup toute son influence, c'est-à-dire le pouvoir de diriger à son gré les votes. Quant à l'orateur inconnu qui arrive avec un discours contenant de bonnes raisons, mais seulement des raisons, il a des chances d'être seulement écouté. (Lebon, 1895)
Woman leader
	•	For women in leadership positions, what often works best is a calm, confident expression, warm yet businesslike. (Greene, 2018)
	•	As women come to attain more leadership positions, this less obtrusive style of authority might begin to alter our perception of some of the dominance cues so long associated with power. (Greene, 2018)
Leadership
	•	Although styles of leadership change with the times, one constant remains: people are always ambivalent about those in power. They want to be led but also to feel free; they want to be protected and enjoy prosperity without making sacrifices; they both worship the king and want to kill him. When you are the leader of a group, people are continually prepared to turn on you the moment you seem weak or experience a setback. Do not succumb to the prejudices of the times, imagining that what you need to do to gain their loyalty is to seem to be their equal or their friend; people will doubt your strength, become suspicious of your motives, and respond with hidden contempt. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Authority is the delicate art of creating the appearance of power, legitimacy, and fairness while getting people to identify with you as a leader who is in their service. If you want to lead, you must master this art from early on in your life. Once you have gained people’s trust, they will stand by you as their leader, no matter the bad circumstances. (Greene, 2018)
	•	This ambivalence toward leaders operates in the following way.On the one hand, we intuitively recognize the need for leaders. In any group, people have their narrow agendas and competing interests. The members feel insecure about their own position and work to secure it. Without leaders who stand above these competing interests and who see the larger picture, the group would be in trouble. Hard decisions would never be made. No one would be guiding the ship. Therefore, we crave leadership and unconsciously feel disoriented, even hysterical, without someone fulfilling this role.On the other hand, we also tend to fear and even despise those who are above us. We fear that those in power will be tempted to use the privileges of their position to accumulate more power and enrich themselves, a common enough occurrence. We are also willful creatures. We don’t feel comfortable with the inferiority and dependence that comes with serving under a leader. We want toexercise our own will and feel our autonomy. We secretly envy the recognition and privileges that leaders possess. This essential ambivalence tips toward the negative when leaders show signs of abuse, insensitivity, or incompetence. No matter how powerful the leaders, no matter how much we might admire them, below the surface sits this ambivalence, and it makes people’s loyalties notoriously fickle and volatile. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Those in power will tend to notice only the smiles of their employees and the applause they receive at meetings, and they will mistake such support for reality. They do not realize that people almost always show such deference to those above them, because their personal fate is in the hands of such leaders and they cannot afford to show their true feelings. And so leaders are rarely aware of the underlying ambivalence that is there even when things are going well. If leaders make some mistakes, or if their power seems shaky, suddenly they will see the mistrust and loss of respect that had been invisibly building up, as the members of the group or the public turn on them with an intensity that is surprising and shocking. Look at the news to see how quickly leaders in any field can lose support and respect, and how quickly they are judged by their latest success or failure. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Throughout history, however, certain notable leaders have been able to erect a bulwark against this volatility, to earn a type of solid respect and support that allowed them to accomplish great things over time. We think of Moses, or the ancient Indian emperor Asoka, or Pericles (see chapter 1), or the Roman general Scipio Africanus, or Queen Elizabeth I. In more modern times we can think of Abraham Lincoln, or Martin Luther King Jr., or Warren Buffett, or Angela Merkel, or Steve Jobs. We shall call such power authority, reverting to the original significance of the word, which comes from the Latin auctoritas, the root meaning “to increase or augment.” (Greene, 2018)
	•	To the ancient Romans, those who had founded their republic possessed tremendous wisdom. Their ancestors had demonstrated this wisdom by how strong and long-lasting were the institutions they had established, and how they had transformed their provincial town into the preeminent power in the known world. To the extent that Roman senators and leaders returned to this basic wisdom and embodied the ideals of the founders, they had authority—an augmented presence, an increased prestige and credibility. Such leaders did not have to resort to speeches or to force. Roman citizens willingly followed their lead and accepted their ideas or advice. Their every word and deed seemed to carry extra weight. This gave them greater leeway in making hard decisions; they were not judged merely by their latest success. (Greene, 2018)
	•	we must see leadership as a dynamic relationship we have with those being led. We have to understand that our slightest gesture has an unconscious effect on individuals. And so we must pay great attention to our attitude, to the tone that we set. We need to attune ourselves to the shifting moods of the members of the group. We must never assume we have their support. Our empathy must be visceral—we can feel when members are losing respect for us. As part of the dynamic, we need to realize that when we show our respect and trust toward those below us, such feelings will flow back to us. The members will open up to our influence. We must try as much as possible to engage people’s willpower, to make them identify with the group’s mission, to want to actively participate in realizing our higher purpose. (Greene, 2018)
	•	When leaders fail to establish these twin pillars of authority—vision and empathy—what often happens is the following: Those in the group feel the disconnect and distance between them and leadership. They know that deep down they are viewed as replaceable pawns. They sense the overall lack of direction and the constant tactical reactions to events. And so, in subtle ways, they begin to feel resentful and to lose respect. They listen less attentively to what such leaders say. They spend more hours in the day thinking of their own interests and future. They join or form factions. They work at half or three-quarter speed. (Greene, 2018)
	•	If such leaders, sensing all of this, become more forceful and demanding, the members become more passive-aggressive. If the leaders become pliant and plead for more support, the members feel even less respect, as if the group were now leading the leader. In this way, the members create endless forms of friction for leaders, who might now feel like they have to drag the group up a hill. This friction, caused by their own inattentiveness, is why so many leaders get so little done and are so mediocre. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Those who maintain their presence of mind and elevate their perspective above the moment tap into the visionary powers of the human mind and cultivate that third eye for unseen forces and trends. They stand out from the group, fulfill the true function of leadership, and create the aura of authority by seeming to possess the godlike ability to read the future. And this is a power that can be practiced and developed and applied to any situation. (Greene, 2018)
Change of leadership
	•	Intelligence analysts are familiar with the problem of weighing internal versus external causes of behavior in a number of contexts. When a new leader assumes control of a foreign government, analysts assess the likely impact of changed leadership on government policy. (Heuer, 1999)
Disdain of leadership
	•	This disdain for authority and leadership has filtered its way throughout our culture. We no longer recognize authority in the arts. Everyone is a legitimate critic, and standards should be personal— nobody’s taste or judgment should be seen as superior. (Greene, 2018)
Irresolute leader
	•	because of our blind spot, we suffer under the irresolute leader, the micromanaging boss, the conniving partner. This is the source of endless tragedies in history, our pattern as a species. (Greene, 2018)
Masucilne leadership
	•	As with male chimpanzees, in a group setting the masculine style is to require a leader, and to either aspire to that role or gain power by being the most loyal follower. Leaders will designate various deputies to do their bidding. Men form hierarchies and punish those who fall out of line. They are highly status conscious, hyperaware of their place in the group. Leaders will tend to use some element of fear to keep the group cohesive. The masculine style of leadership is to identify clear goals and reach them. It puts emphasis on results, however they are achieved. (Greene, 2018)
	•	For those with the masculine style, it is important to enlarge your concept of leadership. When you think more deeply about the individuals on the team and strategize to involve them more, you can have superior results, engaging the energy and creativity of the group. Studies have shown that boys are as empathetic as girls, highly attuned, for instance, to the emotions of the mother. But empathy is slowly drummed out of men as they come to develop their assertive style. Some of the greatest male leaders in history, however, managed to retain and develop their empathy. A leader such as Sir Ernest HenryShackleton (see chapter 2) was no less of a man for his constant consideration of the emotions of each of the men he was responsible for—he was simply a stronger and more effective leader. The same could be said of Abraham Lincoln. (Greene, 2018)
Feminine leadership
	•	The feminine style is more about maintaining the group spirit and keeping the relationships smoothed out, with fewer differences among individuals. It is more empathetic, considering the feelings of each member and trying to involve them more in the decision-making process. Results are important, but the way they are achieved, the process, is equally important. (Greene, 2018)
	•	For those of the feminine style, you must not be afraid of assuming a strong leadership role, particularly in times of crisis. Considering the feelings of everyone and incorporating the ideas of too many will weaken you and your plans. Although women are certainly better listeners, sometimes it is best to know when to stop listening and go with the plan you have opted for. Once you recognize the fools, the incompetents, and the hyperselfish in the group, it is best to fire them and to even find pleasure in getting rid of those who bring the whole group down. Instilling a touch of fear in your lieutenants is not always a bad thing. (Greene, 2018)
Learn
	•	To learn requires a sense of humility. We must admit that there are people out there who know our field much more deeply than we do. Their superiority is not a function of natural talent or privilege, but rather of time and experience. But if we are not comfortable with this fact, if we feel in general mistrustful of any kind of authority, we will succumb to the belief that we can just as easily learn something on our own, that being self-taught is more authentic. We feel, perhaps unconsciously, that learning from Masters and submitting to their authority is somehow an indictment of our own natural ability. (Greene, 2014)

Learned helplesness
	•	« Si un sujet est soumis à des stress inévitables, écrit J. Corraze (op. cit., p. 79), ou s’il perd, ce qui revient au même, le contrôle des renforceurs, il finit par présenter un passivité excessive, une altération des motivations, un état que Sligman qualifie de détresse acquise. » (Mannoni, 1985)
Learning
	•	Learning from surprises is a reasonable thing to do, but it can have some dangerous consequences. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	learning depend on variation, cross-pollination of ideas, and are stifled by unilateral mandates. (Dudley, 2014)
	•	The natural model for learning came from watching and imitating others, then repeating the action over and over. Our brains are highly suited for this form of learning. (Greene, 2014)
	•	Even with skills that are primarily mental, such as computer programming or speaking a foreign language, it remains the case that we learn best through practice and repetition—the natural learning process. (Greene, 2014)
	•	When you are doing activities that mesh with your natural inclinations, you feel ease in the effort. You learn faster. (Greene, 2018)
	•	The teaching procedures both shape the 'appearance' or the 'phenomenon' and establish a firm connection with words, so that finally the phenomena seem to speak for themselves, without outside help or extraneous knowledge. They just are what the associated statements assert them to be. (Feyerabend, 1993)
Collective learning
	•	Collective learning (i.e. the capacity to accumulate knowledge at the level of the community) is what makes us different from every other species on the planet. (Coker, 2009)
	•	What gives knowledge an increasingly corporate character is that we have discovered that collectively we can make much more sense of the world than we can alone. (Coker, 2009) 
Experience learning
	•	If people truly learned from their experience, we would find few mistakes in the world and career paths that ascend ever upward. (Greene, 2018)
Lerning theory
	•	théories de l’apprentissage : le petit enfant enregistrerait dès son plus jeune âge des schémas de conduites et des types de réponse à des situations données qu’il reproduirait ensuite de façon automatique. (Mannoni, 1985)
Legal system
Standard of proof
	•	The attitude of lawyers to scientific uncertainty is somewhat more complicated. The legal system has a time-tested system for expressing subjective uncertainty with a reasonable degree of precision: namely the standard of proof. (Weiss, 2008)
	•	The most familiar of these standards are those of the criminal law (‘‘beyond a reasonable doubt’’) and of civil law (‘‘preponderance of the evidence’’). Each of these is in essence a statement of the level of uncertainty that is tolerable in the evidence presented to a court in a given legal situation. This tolerable level of uncertainty is set very low in a criminal trial, in which guilt must be proven ‘‘beyond a reasonable doubt.’’ This is intended to ensure that no defendant can be convicted by evidence whose uncertainty makes the jury hesitate before making a decision. Much more uncertainty is allowed in a typical civil proceeding, which is decided according to a ‘‘preponderance of the evidence.’’ (Weiss, 2008)
	•	Despite the existence of the standard of proof as a long-standing tool for the treatment of uncertainty, the attitude of the legal system and the legal profession toward uncertainty remains deeply ambivalent. This ambivalence shows itself both at the level of principle and in practice. As to principle, lawyers and judges have shown great reluctance to associate standards of proof with a subjective quantitative probability, or in some cases, even to define them with verbal precision. (Weiss, 2008)
Legend
	•	La création des légendes qui circulent si aisément dans les foules n'est pas déterminée seulement par une crédulité complète. Elle l'est encore par les déformations prodigieuses que subissent les événements dans l'imagination de gens assemblés. L'événement le plus simple vu par la foule est bientôt un événement transformé. Elle pense par images, et l'image évoquée en évoque elle-même une série d'autres n'ayant aucun lien logique avec la première. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	La raison nous montre ce que dans ces images il y a d'incohérence, mais la foule ne le voit guère; et ce que son imagination déformante ajoute à l'événement réel, elle le confondra avec lui. La foule ne sépare guère le subjectif de l'objectif. Elle admet comme réelles les images évoquées dans son esprit, et qui le plus souvent n'ont qu'une parenté lointaine avec le fait observé. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Dans cet exemple on voit se dérouler bien clairement le mécanisme de l'hallucination collective tel que nous l'avons expliqué. D'un côté, une foule en état d'attention expectante; de l'autre, une suggestion faite par la vigie signalant un bâtiment désemparé en mer, suggestion qui, par voie de contagion, fut acceptée par tous les assistants, officiers ou matelots. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Dès que quelques individus sont réunis, ils constituent une foule, et, alors même qu'ils seraient des savants distingués, ils prennent tous les caractères des foules pour ce qui est en dehors de leur spécialité. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	le point de départ de la suggestion est toujours l'illusion produite chez un individu par des réminiscences plus ou moins vagues, puis la contagion par voie d'affirmation de cette illusion primitive. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Ce que l'observateur voit alors, ce n'est plus l'objet lui-même, mais l'image évoquée dans son esprit. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	observations collectives sont les plus erronées de toutes et que le plus souvent elles représentent simplement l'illusion d'un individu qui, par voie de contagion, a suggestionné les autres. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Connaissons-nous un seul mot de vrai concernant la vie des grands hommes qui ont joué les rôles prépondérants dans l'humanité, tels que Hercule, Bouddha, Jésus ou Mahomet? Très probablement non. Au fond d'ailleurs, leur vie réelle nous importe fort peu. Ce que nous avons intérêt à connaître, ce sont les grands hommes tels que la légende populaire les a fabriqués. Ce sont les héros légendaires, et pas du tout les héros réels, qui ont impressionné l'âme des foules. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Il n'est même pas besoin que les siècles aient passé sur les héros pour que leur légende soit transformée par l'imagination des foules. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Sous les Bourbons, Napoléon devint une sorte de personnage idyllique philanthrope et libéral, ami des humbles, qui, au dire des poètes, devaient conserver son souvenir sous le chaume pendant bien longtemps. Trente ans après, le héros débonnaire était devenu un despote sanguinaire qui, après avoir usurpé le pouvoir et la liberté, fit périr trois millions d'hommes uniquement pour satisfaire son ambition. De nos jours, nous assistons à une nouvelle transformation de la légende. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	l'histoire ne peut guère éterniser que des mythes. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Le merveilleux et le légendaire sont les vrais supports des civilisations.—L'imagination populaire a toujours été la base de la puissance des hommes d'État. (Lebon, 1895)
Legitimacy
	•	Legitimacy is built by conforming to the social rules and expectations established by stakeholders. (Coombs and Holladay, 1996)
	•	legitimacy is critical to the successful operation of an organization (DiMaggio & Powell. 1991). (Coombs and Holladay, 1996)

Legitimacy theory
	•	Legitimacy theory is based on the concept of a social contract whereby companies are in need of a positive relationship with society in order to ensure access to resources (Shocker & Sethi 1974). Companies seek congruence between perceptions of outsider’s of the company’s social values and society’s conception of acceptable organisational conduct (Mathews 1993). A perceived disparity between a company’s values and societal values represents a threat to the company’s legitimacy and a breach of their social contract (Dowling & Pfeffer 1975). (Summerhays and de Villiers, 2012)
Legitimacy threat
	•	A legitimacy threat can be serious, even endangering continued survival, because stakeholders can withdraw support and limit resources (Parsons 1960; Pfeffer & Salancik 1978). (Summerhays and de Villiers, 2012)
Legitimacy crises
	•	Legitimacy crises can be precipitated by sudden revelations of new information about a company that differs from prior perceptions (Sethi 1977). (Summerhays and de Villiers, 2012)

Leninism
Leninist illusion
	•	The Leninist illusion has no contemporary base outside of the various Trotskyist tendencies. Here the identification of the proletarian project with a hierarchic organization of ideology unwaveringly survives the experience of all its results. (Debord, 2012)
Level of analysis in international relations
	•	[…] we use levels of analysis extensively to locate the actors, referent objects, and dynamics of interaction that operate in the realm of security. (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	By levels, we mean objects for analysis that are defined by a range of spatial scales, from small to large. (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	Levels are locations where both outcomes and sources of explanation can be located. (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	[…] nothing Is intrinsic to levels themselves that suggests any particular pattern or priority of relation among them. (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	Level are simply ontological referents for where thing happen rather than sources of explanation in themselves. (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	Levels provide a framework within which one can theorize; they are not theories in themselves. They enable one to locate the sources of explanation and the outcomes of which theories are composed. (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	[…]  it is not always possible to locate actors clearly within a given level. (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	There is no necessity for levels to privilege states – the unit level can encompass much more than states. (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	[…] in international relations one should be aware of the tendency for the levels-of-analysis scheme to reinforce state-centric thinking. (Buzan et al., 1997)
International system
	•	International systems, meaning the largest conglomerates of interacting or interdependent units that have no system level above them. Currently, this level encompasses the entire planet, but in early times several more or less disconnected international systesm existed simultaneously (Buzan and Little 1994). (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	the global level, is useful for studying the greatpowers, and also for thinking about systemic referent objects (the globalenvironment, the world economy, international society). (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	The international system involved a growing division of labour driven and powered by globalization (then in its early stages) which deepened and intensified interconnections and interdependencies. (Coker, 2009)
International subystems
	•	International subsystems, meaning groups of units within the international system that can be distinguished from the entire system by the particular nature or intensity of thei interactions with or interdependence on each other. (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	Subsystems may be territorially coherent, in which case they are regional (the Association of Southeast Asian Nations [ASEAN], the Organization of African Unity [OAU]), or not (the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries), in which case they are not regions but simply sbsystems. (Buzan et al., 1997)
Regional level
	•	The regional level matters most for the states within it, but also substantially for the global powers. (Buzan and Wæver, 2003)
	•	They are substantially self-contained not in the sense of being totally free-standing, but rather in possessing a security dynamic that would exist even if other actors did not impinge on it. (Buzan and Wæver, 2003)
	•	The regional level may or may not dominate, but it will nearly always be in play in some significant sense, and cannot be dropped out of the analysis. (Buzan and Wæver, 2003)
	•	regions are a special type of subsystem. (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	Regions are objects of analysis in themselves, particular locations where one can find outcomesand sources of explanation. (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	Identifying the mechanism that forms regions underpins the argument for paying attention to the regionalizing aspect of thesubsystem level in the analysis of international security. (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	by region we mean a spatially coherent territory composed of two or more states. (Buzan et al., 1997)
Subregion
	•	Subregion means part of such a region, whether itinvolves more than one state (but fewer than all of the states in the region)or some transnational composition (some mix of states, parts of states, orboth). (Buzan et al., 1997)
Microregion
	•	Microregion refers to the subunit level within the boundaries of a state. (Buzan et al., 1997)
Unit
	•	Units, meaning actors composed of various subgroups, organizations, communities, and many individuals and sufficiently coherent and independent to be differentiated rom others and to havestanding at the higher levels (e.g., states, nations, transnational firms). (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	the units (states) are fixed ratherthan mobile. (Buzan et al., 1997) 
	•	In contemporary international relations theory, it is taken forgranted that the main political units are not mobile, but this was not always so. (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	if units are mobile, each unit's average environment will, after a reasonable time, constitute the system as suchrather than any particular segment of that system.
	•	If the units are nonmobile, each unit will face a relatively stable regional environmentconsisting of the major units in its geographical proximity; each unit willbe characterized by a specific location in the system's structure (Mouritzen1980: 172,180). (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	
Subunit
	•	Subunites, meaning organized groups of individuals within units are able (or that try) to affect the bahavior of the unit (e.g. bureaucracies, lobbies). (Buzan et al., 1997)
Liberalism
	•	[…] liberalism as ‘a way of talking about power, a form of political culture’ (Ackerman, 1980:6). He finds that it can be defined within three constraints: rationality, consistency, and neutrality. Rationality means the requirement that any claim be supported by reasons. Consistency safeguards the intelligibility of the dialogue demanded by rationality. Neutrality protects the continuance of the dialogue against assertions of intrinsic superiority (Douglas, 2005:135)
Life
	•	Life is inherently chaotic and unpredictable. The human animal, however, does not react well to uncertainty. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Life is inherently complex and unpredictable, its powers far beyond anything we can ever completely comprehend or control. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Life on the other hand is movement, connection to other living things, and diversity of life forms.  (Greene, 2018)
	•	yPrior to von Neumann’s demonstration, it was held that only living things could reproduce themselves; von Neumann’s ‘existence proof’ made it clear that machines could reproduce themselves as well, completely changing our definition of ‘life’. (Holland, 2014)
Life-style factors 
	•	life-style factors such as diet and, in particular, smoking, have a profound effect on human cancer risks. (Moolgavkar and Leubeck, 2002)
Life pattern
	•	We see these patterns and they don’t, because nobody likes to believe that they are operating under some kind of compulsion beyond their control. It is too disturbing a thought. (Greene, 2018)
	•	If we are honest with ourselves, we must admit there is some truth to the concept of fate. We are prone to repeat the same decisions and methods of dealing with problems. There is a pattern to our life, particularly visible in our mistakes and failures. But there is a different way of looking at this concept: it is not spirits or gods that control us but rather our character. (Greene, 2018)
Phase of life
	•	As we pass through the phases of life—youth, emerging adult, middle age, and old age—we notice certain common changes in us. In our youth we experience life more intensely. We are more emotional and vulnerable. Most of us tend to be outwardly focused, concerned with what people might think of us and with how we fit in. We are more gregarious but prone to foolish behavior and self-righteousness.As we get older, the intensity diminishes, our minds tend to tighten up around certain conventional ideas and beliefs. We slowly become less concerned with what people think of us, and thus more inwardly directed. What we sometimes gain in these later phases is some distance from life, some self-control, and perhaps the wisdom that comes from accumulating experiences. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Part of the reason we become less gregarious with the years is that we become judgmental and intolerant of people’s quirks, all of which does not enhance our experience of life. We can alter that as well by coming to understand human nature more deeply and accepting people as they are. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Aging has a psychological component and can be a self-fulfilling prophecy—we tell ourselves we are slowing down and cannot do or attempt as much as we did in past, and as we act on these thoughts, we intensify the aging process, which makes us depressed and prone to slow down even more. (Greene, 2018)
Life force
	•	In our modern conception of the soul, we replace this external spiritual force with life itself, or what can be described as the life force. Life is inherently complex and unpredictable, its powers far beyond anything we can ever completely comprehend or control. This life force is reflected in nature and human society by the remarkable diversity we find in both realms. (Greene, 2018)
Life purpose
	•	We can say something similar about your life: operating with a high sense of purpose is a force multiplier. All of your decisions and actions have greater power behind them because they are guided by a central idea and purpose. The many sides to your character are channeled into this purpose, giving you more sustained energy. Your focus and your ability to bounce back from adversity give you ineluctable momentum. You can ask more of yourself. And in a world where so many people are meandering, you will spring past them with ease and attract attention for this. People will want to be around you to imbibe your spirit. (Greene, 2018)
	•	The gravitational pull we feel toward finding a purpose comes from two elements in human nature. First, unable to rely on instincts as other animals do, we require some means of having a sense of direction, a way to guide and restrict our behavior. Second, we humans are aware of our puniness as individuals in a world with billions of others in a vast universe. We are aware of our mortality, and how we will eventually be swallowed up in the eternity of time. We need to feel larger than just the individuals we are, and connected to something that transcends us. (Greene, 2018)
Likelihood
	•	Probability, likelihood, and chance each mean the extent to which something could occur. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Likelihood and chance imply qualitative expressions (using words). (Newsome, 2013)
	•	The likelihoods run from no chance to certainty, but these words are routinely misunderstood and misused to mean narrower ranges. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Likehood is a potentially loaded word because it sounds similar to likely. (For instance, unfortunately, FrameNet defines likelihood as “the state or fact of being likely.”). (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Like a good desciprtion of risk, a good description of likelihood is more accurately expressed under specified conditions (such as “given saturated ground and an earthquake, then the probability of an earthslide is z”). (Newsome, 2013)
	•	He observed that ‘likelihood’ was a dynamic concept and was contingent upon specific developments. (Kahana, 2002)
	•	Likelihood is a measure of how often an event occurs (its frequency) or the probability of it occurring in a given time period. (Cook, 2008)
Likelihood of hazards
	•	The likelihood of hazards is different to that of accidents. True hazards [as defined strictly, the UK Defence Standards (MoD 2006) for one source] are states, not events. States can be referred to as conditions. One example is “the vehicle is on a public road”. The likelihood of this is measured in terms of the probability of being true at any instant in time.  (Cook, 2008)
Linear system
	•	Linear systems always respond proportionately. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
	•	One of the insights of chaos is to focus on information content. In linear systems variance reflects information content. Information content is more subtle in nonlinear systems, where size is not the only indicator of importance. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
	•	As long as the model is linear and the observational noise is from the bell-shaped distribution, then we have the intuitively appealing aim of minimizing the distance between the forecast and the target. Distance is defined in the usual least squares sense: based on adding up the squares of the differences in each component of the state. As the data set grows, the parameter values we estimate will get closer and closer to those that generated the data – assuming of course that our linear model really did generate the data. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
Linguistic
	•	As Itkonen has pointed out, histories of linguistics tend to 'vacillate uneasily between [...] being value-free and not being value-free' (1991: 1). (Hutton, 1998)
	•	Amsler remarks that '[t]he development of Western linguistics can be mapped in great detail as a series of responses to the question of whether or not language has a history' (1989: 9). (Hutton, 1998)
	•	Two of the key figures in the transition of linguistics from historical science to the science of 'what the speaker knows' are Br6al and Saussure. Wolf, in the preface to his translation of key texts by Bréal (1991), characterises Br6al's approach to etymology in terms of a belief that 'the ultimate etymological criterion is not the sound law but what might be termed the law of communicational rationality: "a likelihood which speaks louder than phonetic rules" [...]' (Wolf 1991: 5, quoting from p. 95). Language change, for Br~al, results from the forgetting of etymology. The meanings of names, originally transparent, were forgotten and mythologies were created: 'What had once designated a force of nature, like the sun, became the name for a god' (Nehrlich, 1992:131). Once the original meaning is forgotten, language is set adrift and is moulded by the requirements and aspirations of the people. Language change is to be seen as a response to human needs. Any classification of semantic changes would be a classification of creative and intellectual forces. Language is not an object that exists beyond individual and collective human control and understanding. (Hutton, 1998)
	•	Nehrlich presents Bréal's notion of linguistic change as involving a kind of progress (1992: 158): For Br6al, the progress of language is linked to the progressive forgetting of the original etymological meaning, it is based on the liberation of the mind from the etymological burden. [...] What Br6al wanted to find were not the original meanings of words, but the intellectual or, as one would nowadays say, cognitive laws which underlie the semantic changes that one can observe in language, and which are the necessary result of our unreflected but intelligent and intentional language-use. Nehrlich argues that 'the concept of polysemy seems to be the centre of gravity around which Bréal's whole semantics rotates' (1992: 162). Polysemy is created when an old form is used to designate a new idea; it remains in synchrony as a trace of linguistic change. The notion of polysemy (ibid.) also demonstrates Bréal's belief in the progress of language, thought and society. Polysemy is an indicator of intellectual and social progress. It also makes it clear that meaning is not subordinated to form, but that meaning is indeed the real force in language evolution. Polysemy shows, like no other process of semantic change, the accumulated victories of mind over matter. (Hutton, 1998)
	•	Modem linguistics, implicitly or explicitly, is in opposition to the rhetoric of cultural conservatives over such issues as language change and language and ethical value. These conservatives have viewed the language as a repository of wisdom, and instruction in etymology as a form of enlightening pedagogy (Trench, 1851: 4). (Hutton, 1998)
	•	The history of linguistics written as the history of a liberation struggle has created a kind of blindness to the social reality within which meanings are debated, contested and discussed. The problem lies not in the narrator adopting a particular point of view on history, in the narrative bias in favour of one approach rather than another. Rather it is that in forgetting etymology we have also forgotten why it was so important. (Hutton, 1998)
Chomskian linguistic
	•	Chomskian linguistics was a central part of the Cognitive Revolution of the 1960s, and the fields of psycholinguistics, as first studied by George Miller and colleagues, and of developmental. (Tomasello, 1998)
	•	Chomskian linguists distanced themselves from psychological experiments that attempted to translate the theory into performance models (perhaps because they yielded, to put it kindly, mixed results; Palermo, 1978). (Tomasello, 1998)
Cognitive linguistic
	•	Cognitive Linguistics grew out of the Chomskian paradigm, as several of its practitioners, especially George Lakoff and Ronald Langacker, became more and more dissatisfied with its narrow scope and its neglect of the cognitive and social dimensions of linguistic communication. (Tomasello, 1998)
	•	both cognitive and functional linguists that language is not an autonomous "mental organ," but rather that it is a complex mosaic of cognitive and social communicative activities closely integrated with the rest of human psychology. (Tomasello, 1998)
	•	cognitive and functional linguists do not accept the distinction between syntax and semantics as it is characterized by Generative Grammar. To these linguists, all language structures are symbolic instruments that serve to convey meaning, from the smallest morphemes to the most complex constructions. (Tomasello, 1998)
Functional Linguistics
	•	Functional Linguistics (or Functional-Typological Linguistics) arose somewhat independently based on the studies of linguists such as Joseph Greenberg and Talmy Givón, who were concerned with comparing different languages with one another typologically and historically. (Tomasello, 1998)
	•	both cognitive and functional linguists that language is not an autonomous "mental organ," but rather that it is a complex mosaic of cognitive and social communicative activities closely integrated with the rest of human psychology. (Tomasello, 1998)
	•	cognitive and functional linguists do not accept the distinction between syntax and semantics as it is characterized by Generative Grammar. To these linguists, all language structures are symbolic instruments that serve to convey meaning, from the smallest morphemes to the most complex constructions. (Tomasello, 1998)
Prague School
	•	Prague School who emphasized the importance of processes of communication in discourse and language. (Tomasello, 1998)
Linguist
	•	This case dramatises the problem of the linguist who rejects prescriptivism as an ideology and embraces the notion of language as a synchronic system grounded in the historically naive speaker's point of view. (Hutton, 1998)
	•	The linguist who uses 'scientific' etymology to point out to participants in such debates that they are mistaken as to the true relationships involved is actually acknowledging that etymology does have a role to play in the establishment of synchronic meaning. (Hutton, 1998)
Linkage
Plausible causal linkage
	•	plausible causal linkages. If these are linkages of which the analyst was already aware, the report has little impact inasmuch as it simply supports existing views. If there are plausible new linkages, however, thinking is restructured to take these into account. (Heuer, 1999)
Livre Blanc sur la Défense
	•	The Livre Blanc sur la Défense [known as the Livre Blanc] is in many respects the most substantial and revealing of official defence documentation. It sets out in some detail an official assessment of the nature of contemporary inter- national security and France’s place and concerns within it, describes at length the major elements and objectives of French defence policy, its armed forces and principal defence industries, and examines related issues such as defence relations with other states and relations between the French armed forces and the French people. (Gregory, 2000)
	•	The purpose of the Livre Blanc is largely one of explanation and prescrip- tion though it sets no budget or other precise constraints on defence policy. It identifies key issues which are of central and lasting concern to the defence and security of France and describes the French responses to those issues over typically the forthcoming 15 to 20 years70, and thus to some extent it both describes the consensus within which the defence debate takes place and prescribes the ideas and trends shaping defence policy into the future. (Gregory, 2000)
Local capacity building
	•	The language of local capacity building suggests a democratic dispersal of power to local communities, minor- ity groups, and others formerly denied access to or purchase over the formal processes of government. (Zedner, 2009)
	•	The possibilities of local capacity building become par- ticularly germane when the state is weak or ‘failing’. (Zedner, 2009)
Loi de Programmation Militaire
	•	The Defence Ministry also prepares the periodic Projet de Loi Relatif à la Programmation Militaire [the formal title of the Loi de Programmation Mili- taire]. This is a document which typically covers a five-year period [the most recent being 1997–2002] and attempts to set a framework for defence spend- ing, procurement and force levels, and includes detailed information about the disposition of the nuclear forces, the air force, army, navy and gendarmerie. (Gregory, 2000)
	•	The Loi de Programmation Militaire is intended as the key prescriptive and explanatory document which shapes and steers defence policy over the mid-term. (Gregory, 2000)
	•	The Loi de Programmation Militaire can thus be seen as the liaison between the longer-term objectives expressed in the Livre Blanc and the annual defence budgets, the better to ensure that the defence budgets maintain a general fidelity with longer-term objectives. (Gregory, 2000)
Logic of opportunity
	•	The logic of opportunity is also a moral logic in so far as it speaks to a new organizational self (Power, 2009)
	•	logic of opportunity also imagines organizations ascapable of facing and managing uncertainties in a rationalized way (Power, 2009)

Longitudinal studies
	•	longitudinal studies is to identify changes over a time period (Thurmond, 2001)
Loop
	•	The combination of high fanout and hierarchical organization results in complex networks that include large numbers of sequences that form loops. (Holland, 2014)
	•	Loops recirculate signals and resources (as when trees absorb water from the ground, which then evaporates from the leaves and ultimately returns to the ground through rainfall). (Holland, 2014)
	•	Loops also offer control through positive and negative feedback (as in a thermostat). Equally important, loops make possible program-like ‘subroutines’ that are partially autonomous in the sense that their activity is only modulated by surrounding activity rather than being completely controlled by it. Such autonomy allows the CAS to run internal activities that go beyond the current stimulus. (Holland, 2014)
	•	More complex loops allow the CAS to ‘look ahead’, examining the effects of various action sequences without actually executing the actions (as in examining alternatives lines of play in a game). (Holland, 2014)
Homotopy
	•	Two loops are said to be homotopic if each can be deformed continuously into the other. Homotopy classes can be combined by combining representative loops and taking the class of all loops homotopic to the result.  (Stewart, 2013)
Loop polarity
	•	Assumption that every dynamically significant feedback loop in a  system contains at least one level (accumulation or integration). (Richardson, 1995)
Positive loop
	•	some define  a loop to be positive if it gives divergent behavior. (Richardson, 1995)
	•	Graham (1977) finds problems with  that characterization and suggests instead  that a loop be called  positive if  its open-loop steady-state gain is greater than 1. (Richardson, 1995)
	•	Richmond (1980) delightfully exposed our confusions by describing  a  well-meaning  professor  trying to explain to a student: “Positive loops are ... er, well, they give rise to exponential growth ... or collapse ... but only undercertain conditions...Under other conditions they behave like negative feedbackloops....” He concluded that the nicest way out of the confusion is to define a positive loop to be a goal-seeking loop whose goal continually “runs off in the direction of the search.” Some, of course, ignore all the subtleties and obtain loop polarities simply by counting negative links (Richardson and Pugh, 1981). (Richardson, 1995)
Loss aversion
	•	The concept of loss aversion is certainly the most significant contribution of psychology to behavioral economics. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	Loss aversion refers to the relative strength of two motives: we are driven more strongly to avoid losses than to achieve gains. A reference point is sometimes the status quo, but it can also be a goal in the future: not achieving a goal is a loss, exceeding the goal is a gain. As we might expect from negativity dominance, the two motives are not equally powerful. The aversion to the failure of not reaching the goal is much stronger than the desire to exceed it. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	the asymmetric intensity of the motives to avoid losses and to achieve gains shows up almost everywhere  (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	Loss aversion is a powerful conservative force that favors minimal changes from the status quo in the lives of both institutions and individuals. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	The influence of loss aversion and entitlements extends far beyond the realm of financial transactions. Jurists were quick to recognize their impact on the law and in the administration of justice  (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	loss aversion protects them from the follies of overconfident optimism. (Kahneman, 2012)
Love
	•	The most telling example, however, occurs when we fall in love and the feeling is reciprocated. The other person appreciates and reflects back to us our most positive qualities. We feel worthy of being loved. Under such a spell, we let go of our ego and our habitual stubbornness; we give the other person unusual sway over our willpower. (Greene, 2018)
	•	We humans like to believe that we are consistent and mature, and that we have reasonable control over our lives. We make decisions based on rational considerations, on what will benefit us the most. We have free will. We know who we are, more or less. But in one particular aspect of life these self-opinions are all easily shattered—when we fall in love.When in love, we become prey to emotions we cannot control. We make choices of partners we cannot rationally explain, and often these choices end up being unfortunate. Many of us will have at least one successful relationship in our lives, but we will tend to have many more that were decidedly unsuccessful, that ended unhappily. And often werepeat the same types of bad choices of partners, as if compelled by some inner demon. (Greene, 2018)
	•	We like to tell ourselves in retrospect that when we were in love, a type of temporary madness overcame us. We think of such moments as representing the exception, not the rule, to our character. But let us entertain for the moment the opposite possibility—in our conscious day-to-day life, we are sleepwalking, unaware of who we really are; we present a front of reasonableness to the world, and we mistake the mask for reality. When we fall in love, we are actually being more ourselves. The mask slips off. We realize then how deeply unconscious forces determine many of our actions. We are more connected to the reality of the essential irrationality in our nature. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Let us look at some of the common changes that occur when we are in love.Normally our minds are in a state of distraction. The deeper we fall in love, however, the more our attention is completely absorbed in one person. We become obsessive.We like to present a particular appearance to the world, one that highlights our strengths. When in love, however, opposite traits often come to the fore. A person who is normally strong and independent can suddenly become rather helpless, dependent, and hysterical. A nurturing, empathetic person can suddenly become tyrannical, demanding, and self-absorbed. (Greene, 2018)
	•	As adults we feel relatively mature and practical, but in love we can suddenly regress to behavior that can only be seen as childish. We experience fears and insecurities that are greatly exaggerated. We feel terror at the thought of being abandoned, like a baby who has been left alone for a few minutes. We have wild mood swings—from love to hate, from trust to paranoia. Normally we like to imagine that we are good judges of other people’s character. Once infatuated or in love, however, we mistake the narcissist for a genius, the suffocator for a nurturer, the slacker for the exciting rebel, the control freak for the protector. Others can often see the truth and try to disabuse us of our fantasies, but we won’t listen. And what is worse, we will often continue to make the same types of mistaken judgments again and again. (Greene, 2018)
	•	In looking at these altered states, we might be tempted to describe them as forms of possession. We are normally rational person A, but under the influence of an infatuation, irrational person B begins to emerge. At first, A and B can fluctuate and even blend into each other, but the deeper we fall in love, the more it is person B who dominates. Person B sees qualities in people that are not there, acts in ways that are counterproductive and even self-destructive, is quite immature, with unrealistic expectations, and makes decisions that are often mysterious later on to person A. (Greene, 2018)
	•	we can say that the specter of death is what impels us toward our fellow humans and makes us avid for love. Death and love are inextricably interconnected. The ultimate separation anddisintegration represented by death drive us to unite and integrate ourselves with others. Our unique consciousness of death has created our particular form of love. And through a deepening of our death awareness we will only strengthen this impulse, and rid ourselves of the divisions and lifeless separations that afflict humanity. (Greene, 2018)
Loyalty
	•	in politics loyalty was ephemeral. (Greene, 2018)
Lynching
	•	Traitant plus précisément des lynchages, l’auteur en décrit, à la suite de Miller et Dollar, deux formes. L’une « bien ordonnée », lynchage « bourbonien » selon les spécialistes, est accomplie par des gens riches dont le but est de « châtier le coupable ». L’autre, désordonnée, est commise par les défavorisés, agissant sous le coup de leur émotion et frappant au hasard. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	les rôles dans un groupe de lyncheurs, par conséquent les conduites affectives individuelles, varient avec la position sociale du sujet et son niveau de culture. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Par leur étendue et leur caractère systématique, les génocides s’apparentent aux lynchages dont ils sont une aggravation par généralisation (accompagnés ou non d’émeutes populaires). Derrière les différentes formes qu’on peut distinguer — génocides de substitution, de dévastation ou d’élimination, selon la classification que propose, par exemple, H. Savon (1972) — le désir est de détruire un groupe humain de fond en comble, d’exterminer tous ses représentants. Inspiré par le même genre d’impulsion que le lynchage, le génocide va bien au-delà de la mise à mort d’un ou de quelques individus dans une démarche fortement symbolique : il est l’expression ultime et radicale du besoin collectif de détruire. De tels comportements de groupe reposent sur une exacerbation de la différence (ethnique, politique, raciale, religieuse) que les éthologues ont pu décrire sous le concept de pseudo-spéciation culturelle10 : l’écart à la norme devenant à lui seul le signal déclencheur de la violence exterminatrice. (Mannoni, 1985)
M
Machiavellian intelligence
	•	Machiavellian intelligence as humans found themselves engaged in a ‘cognitive arms race’. (Coker, 2009)
Machine learning methods
	•	Statistical methods rely on probability distributions whereas machine-learning methods are based on algorithms. Ultimately, the two approaches help us learn new facts about the phenomenon we study. The methods used should be flexible enough for us to discover not only what we are searching for, but also trends and facts that might not be on our radar. The known unknowns are rather easier to find than the unknown unknowns. Data mining should be equally good for both. (Haider, 2016)
Magnitude
	•	Mathematics provides a way to find whether a magnitude is heterogeneous or homogeneous. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
Maker mindset
	•	We have a project to get done, perhaps with a deadline. The only emotion we can afford is excitement and energy. Other emotions simply make it impossible to concentrate. Because we have to get results, we become exceptionally practical. We focus on the work—our mind calm, our ego not intruding. If people try to interrupt or infect us with emotions, we resent it. These moments—as fleeting as a few weeks or hours—reveal the rational self that is waiting to come out. It just requires some awareness and some practice. (Greene, 2018)
Male
Alfa male
	•	Alpha males like to signal their superior position in the rank in several ways: They speak faster than others and feel entitled to interrupt and control the flow of the conversation. Their handshake is extra vigorous, almost crushing. When they walk in the office, you will see them assume a taller stance and a purposeful stride, generally making inferiors walk behind them. Watch chimpanzees in a zoo and you will notice similar behavior on the part of the alpha chimp. (Greene, 2018)
Man made disaster
	•	Failures and crisis in large organizations have been diagnosed under the motif of the 'man made disaster', a concept which focuses attention on organizational and managerial processes which 'incubate' disaster or crisis (see Turner and Pidgeon, 1997) (Power, 2009)
	•	Man-caused is a common adjective for hazards, but apart from being prejudicially gendered, it is often restricted to very contradictory behaviors, from terrorism to accidents. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Man-caused literally includes both deliberate and accidental activities. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Human-manufactured hazards and threats are material items that exist only because of a human constructive process. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Human-manufactured hazards and threats include hazards and threats with no natural equivalents. (Newsome, 2013)

Management
	•	Organizing and managing are fundamentally about individual and collective human efforts to process uncertainty (Power, 2009)
Management orthodoxy
	•	Management orthodoxy suggests that organizations represent co- operative endeavours which seek to process and manage different sources of uncertainty in the pursuit of a goal, e.g. profit. (Hutter and Power, 2005)
Managerial control
	•	Organizational designers need to be careful that they do not vacillate between: lots of well-specified authorities that are overwhelmed by responsabilities and inefficiently dispute each other, and; poorly specified authorities that are unaccountable or ensure. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	They should be careful too not to vacillate between: highly centralized management, which should be materially efficient but is remote from lower managers and possibly unaware of managerial practices at lower levels, and; decentralized management, which could be more efficient for the system as a whole, if lower managers are self-motivated and skilled, but also hide dysfunctional practices from higher managers (Newsome, 2007, pp. 18-22). (Newsome, 2013)
Managerial design of risk management
	•	managerial design of risk management signifies a general shift to a regulatory style which relies increasingly on the self-governing capacities of organizations. (Power, 2009)
Managerial turn
	•	The 'managerial turn' in risk management is the product of newly powerful non-state global carriers of knowledge, consisting of an academic clergy, consultants, professional associations, and related meta-organizations (Power, 2009)
Manipulator
	•	We humans are by nature quite gullible. We want to believe in certain things—that we can get something for nothing; that we can easily regain or rejuvenate our health thanks to some new trick, perhaps even cheat death; that most people are essentially good and can be trusted. This propensity is what deceivers and manipulators thrive on. (Greene, 2018)
	•	The most clear and common sign comes when people assume an extra-animated front. When they smile a lot, seem more than friendly, and even are quite entertaining, it is hard for us to not be drawn in and lower ever so slightly our resistance to their influence. (Greene, 2018)
	•	if people are trying to cover something up, they tend to become extra vehement, righteous, and chatty. They are playing on the conviction bias (see chapter 1)—if I deny or say something with so much gusto, with an air of being a victim, it is hard to doubt me. We tend to take extra conviction for truth. In fact, when people try to explain their ideas with so much exaggerated energy, or defend themselves with an intense level of denial, that is precisely when you should raise your antennae. (Greene, 2018)
	•	the cover-up and the soft sell—the deceiver is striving to distract you from the truth. Although an animated face and gestures might come from sheer exuberance and genuine friendliness, when they come from someone you don’t know well, or from someone who just might have something to hide, you must be on your guard. Now you are looking for nonverbal signs to confirm your suspicions. (Greene, 2018)
	•	the best thing to do when you suspect people of trying to distract you from the truth is not to actively confront them in the beginning, but in fact to encourage them to continue by showing interest in what they are saying or doing. You want them to talk more, to reveal more signs of tension and contrivance. At the right moment you must surprise them with a question or remark that is designed to make them uncomfortable, revealing you are onto them. Pay attention to the microexpressions and body language they emit at such moments. If they are really deceiving, they will often have a freeze response as they take this in, and then quickly try to mask the underlying anxiety. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Even with the most practiced deceivers, one of the best ways to unmask them is to notice how they give emphasis to their words through nonverbal cues. It is very difficult for humans to fake this. Emphasis comes through raised vocal pitch and assertive tone, forceful hand gestures, the raising of eyebrows and the widening of eyes. We might also lean forward or rise up on the balls of our feet. We engage in such behavior when we are filled with emotion and trying to add an exclamation point to what we are saying. It is hard for deceivers to mimic this. The emphasis they place with their voice or body is not exactly correlated to what they are saying, does not quite fit the context of the moment, or comes a little too late. When they pound the table with their fist, it is not at the moment they should be feeling the emotion, but a little earlier, as if on cue, as if to create an effect. These are all cracks in the veneer of the realness they are trying to project. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Le troisième facteur, qui est de loin le plus important pour G. Le Bon, c’est la « suggestibilité » (ibid.). Croyant s’engager alors sur le terrain ferme de la physiologie, il postule la quasi-identité de l’état de l’individu en foule avec l’état hypnotique. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Il n’est plus lui-même, mais un automate que sa volonté est devenue impuissante à guider ». (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	le manieur d’hommes qui exerce sur chacun une fascination que Le Bon appelle « la séduction ». C’est une autre manière de nommer le charisme des meneurs dont nous avons déjà parlé. (Mannoni, 1985)
Marginal
	•	Leur petit nombre40 permet de les considérer comme des cas relativement exceptionnels et de les expliquer par la pathologie sociale ou organique. Si certains individus se refusent à la loi commune, se démarquent par leur agressivité ou par leur délire, ce ne peut être imputable qu’à un trouble. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	La transgression des normes ne provoque pas seulement une réaction collective de répression. C’est ainsi que G. Devereux (1970, p. 119) a pu écrire : « Pour sa part, la société accorde une reconnaissance explicite à tout déviant, même le plus extrême, et cela de manière parfois fort étonnante. Roheim et moi, nous avons tous deux eu l’occasion d’observer, dans deux sociétés primitives différentes, la condamnation avec admiration du mâle incestueux (...). Le prestige romantique du déviant reflète dans une certaine mesure l’acceptation imparfaite de la norme, même de la part des individus les mieux adaptés, et leur identification avec le ‘héros’, le grand criminel et l’excentrique qui osent la défier. » (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Cette ambivalence apparaît nettement dans les termes qu’utilise, par exemple, la presse à grand tirage pour parler de ces individus. Les journalistes, faisant appel à une mythologie de bazar et mélangeant les genres, désignent les Carlos et Mesrine comme des êtres hybrides, mi-chevaliers mi-démons, mi-Robin des Bois, mi-Fantômas. Ce qui n’empêche pas la foule de trouver réconfortant le spectacle de leur exécution. (Mannoni, 1985)
Market
	•	market the focus is upon individuals exchanging privately owned goods; the individual and the rights that accrue to him from ownership are the given of the economic mode of thought, the rarely questioned starting point of the analysis (Douglas, 2005:125)
	•	Markets, as the circus and theatre examples show, can cope with joint supply so long as access to the good can be controlled (Douglas, 2005:129)
	•	Markets are built over the tension between the requirement of private property and the requirement of an open market (Douglas, 2005:141)
Market economy
	•	[…] market economy consists of the spontaneous transaction of goods and services, a characteristic of spontaneous transaction is that there is no individual who loses in the transaction itself (Torriti and Ikpeb, 2014)
Market failure
	•	Market failures in the context of chemicals regulation may include (but are not limited to) harm to humans and the environment from a chemical, which is an exter- nality if it is not reflected in the prices of chemicals; lack of hazard information; lack of exposure information; lack of information on a chemical’s socioeconomic benefits; and many types of information asymmetries between various manufacturers, manufacturers and downstream users, industry and the government, industry and consumers, the government and consumers, and even between different governments. Each of these failures may require a different policy tool, or even the same tool applied at different points in the market. (Abelkop and Graham, 2014)
	•	If the market failure is an information gap due to lack of toxicity data, replacing one chemical with another addresses the failure only if there is better toxicity information about the substitute than the original. (Abelkop and Graham, 2014)
	•	The functional or market failure answer says regime content varies mainly because types of risk vary, producing different sorts of correction that regulators need to make to deal with market failure. (Hood et al., 2001)
	•	The ‘market failure’ (MF) hypothesis is that in a liberal-capitalist society, government will experience pressure to restrict its economic interventions to the minimal response necessary to correct market failures. (Hood et al., 2001)
	•	regulatory regime content will reflect the inherent nature of each risk, and specifically the extent to which it is technically feasible for markets, including insurance, or the law of tort to operate as regulators of risk. (Hood et al., 2001)
	•	The market failure approach is widely considered to be a ‘rational’ basis for regulatory design. (Hood et al., 2001)
	•	From orthodox economic assumptions, making the minimum state response necessary to correct specific market failures can be expected to maximize Pareto-efficiency in the economy, and that approach is reflected in doctrines of ‘proportionality’ as a test of good regulation in both law and economics. (Hood et al., 2001)
	•	The value of an MF analysis for our purposes is that it does not suggest the state will adopt a one-size-fits-all response to each risk domain, but rather points to the ways the state can be expected to deal with each risk on the minimal feasible scale and deploy the least intrusive and extensive regulatory response that matches the specific market-failure problem at issue in each case. (Hood et al., 2001)
	•	an MF approach does not need to assume that the danger posed by all hazards can be expressed in terms of well-understood quantifiable risk, or that everyone is perfectly informed about every danger. But it does rest on the assumption that individuals are capable of taking reasonable steps to inform themselves about the hazards that may affect them. It also assumes that the general law, as it evolves through statute or case decisions, will place obligations to collect or produce information about risk in the hands of those who are best-placed to do so, for instance in settling the expected balance of information-gathering responsibilities among employers and workers (see Posner 1986: 167). (Hood et al., 2001)
	•	The value of a narrow conception of MF is that it can serve as a sort of benchmark: a basis for identifying the minimal conceivable state response to the ‘market failure’ presented by each hazard. (Hood et al., 2001)
	•	an MF account is consistent with a number of our observations of regime content in nine different risk domains, particularly for information-gathering.
	•	MF expectations seemed rather better at predicting the information- gathering dimension of regulation than the standard-setting or behaviour-modification dimension. (Hood et al., 2001)
	•	The limited predictive power of the MF hypothesis may surprise those who stress the inexorable forces of global capitalism playing on modern liberal democracies. (Hood et al., 2001)
Market prices
	•	Market prices provide one source of guidance for monetization, whose interpretation requires both scientific and ethical judgments. (Fischhoff, 2015)
Market system
	•	market system depends on open markets, free bargaining, private property, and some protection for contract (Douglas, 2005:139)
	•	A market system needs freedom to expand, to find new outlets, and to justify increased scale of production (Douglas, 2005:141)
Marketing
Viral marketing
	•	This characteristic of endurance, which is a real problem with computer viruses, can be turned into a resource if one wants to disseminate information in a heterogeneous network. This is the principle behind viral marketing. Thanks to virtual social networks, today the WWW is full of videos, games, and applications that have ‘gone viral’: they are being forwarded by hundreds of thousands of people to all their contacts every day. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
	•	Viral marketing takes advantage of an underlying psychological phenomenon called social spreading. This is the general tendency of people to mimic their contacts’ behaviours, and to spread gossip, fads, rumours and ideas. This mechanism also acts in innovation adoption, group problem solving, and collective decision making. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
Marking
	•	‘Marking’ is said to involve the selection of some attribute of the object. (Breakwell, 2014)
	•	Marking pinpoints the negative aspects of the identity of the product, place or technology that has been derived from the hazard. (Breakwell, 2014)
Masculine
	•	The male sense of masculinity often has a defensive edge that reveals underlying insecurities. Such insecurity has only become more acute with shifting gender roles, and it increases the suspiciousness and hostility between men and women. (Greene, 2018)
Hypermasculine
	•	Pay special attention to those who are hypermasculine or hyperfeminine. You can be sure that below the surface lurks a very feminine anima for the man and a very masculine animus for the woman. When people go extra far in repressing their feminine or masculine qualities, these will tend to leak out in a caricatured form. (Greene, 2018)
	•	The hypermasculine man, for instance, will be secretly obsessed with clothes and his looks. He will display an unusual interest in people’s appearances, including other men, and make rather snippy judgments about them. Richard Nixon desperately tried to project a macho image to those who worked for him as president, but he was constantly commenting on and fussing over the color of the suits they wore and the drapes in his office. The hypermasculine man will express strong opinions about cars, technology, or politics that are not based on real knowledge, and when called on this, he will become rather hysterical in his defense, throw a tantrum, or pout. He is always trying to contain his emotions, but they can often have a life of their own. For instance, without wanting to, he will suddenly become quite sentimental. (Greene, 2018)
Masculine qualities
	•	All of us have masculine and feminine qualities—some of this is genetic, and some of it comes from the profound influence of the parent of the opposite sex. (Greene, 2018)
	•	But in the need to present a consistent identity in society, we tend to repress these qualities, overidentifying with the masculine or feminine role expected of us. And we pay a price for this. We lose valuable dimensions to our character. Our thinking and ways of acting become rigid. Our relationships with members of the opposite sex suffer as we project onto them our own fantasies and hostilities. You must become aware of these lost masculine or feminine traits and slowly reconnect to them, unleashing creative powers in the process. You will become more fluid in your thinking. In bringing out the masculine or feminine undertone to your character, you will fascinate people by being authentically yourself. Do not play the expected gender role, but rather create the one that suits you. (Greene, 2018)
Masters
	•	Masters thus have a sense of how everything interacts organically, and they can intuit patterns or solutions in an instant. This fluid form of thinking does not occur through a step-by-step process, but rather comes in flashes an insights as the brain makes sudden connections between disparate form of knowledge, causing us to sense the dynamic in real time. (Greene, 2014)
	•	It would be a misconception, however, to imagine that Masters are simply following their intuitions and moving beyond rational thinking. First, it is through all of their hard work, the depth of their knowledge, and the development of their analytical skills that they reach this higher form of intelligence. Second, when they experience this intuition or insight, they invariably subject it to a high degree of reflection and reasoning. In science, they must spend months or years verifying their intuitions. In the arts, they must work out the ideas that come to them intuitively and rationally shape them into a form. This is hard for us to imagine, because we find intuition and rationality mutually exclusive, but in fact at this high level they operate together in a seamless fasion. (Greene, 2014)
	•	The reasoning of Masters is guided by intuition; their intuition springs from intense rational focus. The two are fused. (Greene, 2014)
	•	People who spend years studying a particular subject or field develop so many of these memory networkds and pathways that their brains are constantly searching for an discovering connections between various pieces of information. When confronted with a high-level problem, the search goes in a hundred directions below conscious awareness, guided by an intuitive snese of where the answer might lie. (Greene, 2014)
	•	The extremely high number of experiences and memory networkds that become hardwired allow the brains of Masters to explore and areathat is so wide that it has the dimensions and feel of reality itself, of the dunamic. (Greene, 2014)
	•	The brain of a Master is so richly interconnected that it comes to resemble the physical world, and becomes a vibrant ecosystem in which all forms of thinking associate and connect. (Greene, 2014)
	•	Mastery is not a function of genius or talent. It is a function of time and intense focus applied to a particular field of knowledge. But there is another element, an X factor that Masters inevitably prossess, that sems mystical but that is accessible to us all. Whatever field of activity we are involved in, there is generally an accepted path to the top. It is a path that others have followed, and because we are conformist creatures, most of us opt for this conventional route. But Masters have a strong inner guiding system and a high level of self-awareness. What has suited others in the past does not suit them, and they know that trying to fit into a conventional mold would only lead to a dampening of spirit, the reality they seek eluding them. And so invevitably, these Masters, as they progress on their career paths, make a choice at a key moment in their lives: they decide to forge their own route, one that others will see as unconventional, but that suits their own spirit and rhythms and leads them closer to discovering the hidden truths of their objects of study. (Greene, 2014)

Mastery
	•	mastery – The feeling that we have a greater command of reality, other people, and ourselves. Although it might be something we experience for only a short while, for others -Masters of their field- It becomes their way of life, their way of seeing the world. And at the root of this power is a simple process that leads to mastery -on that is accessible to all of us. (Greene, 2014)
	•	In the process leading to this ultimate form of power, we can identify three distinct phases or levels. The first is the Apprenticeship; the second is the Creative-Active; the third, Mastery. In the first phase, we stand on the outside of our field, learning as much as we can of the basic elements and rules. In the second phase, through much practice and immersion, we see into the inside of the machinery, how things connect with one another, and thus gain a more comprehensive understanding of the subject. With this comes a new power—the ability to experiment and creatively play with the elements involved. In the third phase, our degree of knowledge, experience, and focus is so deep that we can now see the whole picture with complete clarity. We can call this power intuition, but intuition is nothing more than a sudden and immediate seizing of what is real, without the need for words or formulas. (Greene, 2014)
	•	Intuitive powers at the mastery level are a mix of the instinctive and the rational, the conscious and the unconscious, the human and the animal. It is our way of making sudden and powerful connections to the environment, to feeling or thinking inside things. As children we had some of this intuitive power and spontaneity, but it is generally drummed out of us by all of the information that overloads our minds over time. Masters return to this childlike state, their works displaying degrees of spontaneity and access to the unconscious, but at a much higher level than the child. If we move through the process to this endpoint, we activate the intuitive power latent in every human brain, one that we may have briefly experienced when we worked so deeply on a single problem or project. When we reach mastery, this intuition is a power at our command, the fruit of working through the lengthier process. (Greene, 2014)
	•	Think of mastery in this way: Throughout history, men and women have felt trapped by the limitations of their consciousness, by their lack of contact with reality and the power to affect the world around them. They have sought all kinds of shortcuts to this expanded consciousness and sense of control, in the form of magic rituals, trances, incantations, and drugs. (Greene, 2014)
	•	This power brings to those who possess it the kind of connection to reality and the ability to alter the world that the mystics and magicians of the past could only dream of. (Greene, 2014)
	•	Over the centuries, people have placed a wall around such mastery. They have called it genius and have thought of it as inaccessible. They have seen it as the product of privilege, inborn talent, or just the right alignment of the stars. They have made it seem as if it were as elusive as magic. But that wall is imaginary. This is the real secret: the brain that we possess is the work of six million years of development, and more than anything else, this evolution of the brain was designed to lead us to mastery, the latent power within us all. (Greene, 2014)
	•	What we find instead in the stories of all great masters is essentially the following pattern: a youthful passion or predilection, a chance encounter that allows them to discover how to apply it, an apprenticeship in which they come alive with energy and focus. They excel by their ability to practice harder and move faster through the process, all of this stemming from the intensity of their desire to learn and from the deep connection they feel to their field of study. And at the core of this intensity of effort is, in fact, a quality that is genetic and inborn—not talent or brilliance, which is something that must be developed, but rather a deep and powerful inclination toward a particular subject. This inclination is a reflection of a person’s uniqueness. This uniqueness is not something merely poetic or philosophical—it is a scientific fact that genetically, every one of us is unique; our exact genetic makeup has never happened before and will never be repeated. This uniqueness is revealed to us through the preferences we innately feel for particular activities or subjects of study. Such inclinations can be toward music or mathematics, certain sports or games, solving puzzle-like problems, tinkering and building, or playing with words. (Greene, 2014)
	•	With those who stand out by their later mastery, they experience this inclination more deeply and clearly than others. They experience it as an inner calling. It tends to dominate their thoughts and dreams. They find their way, by accident or sheer effort, to a career path in which this inclination can flourish. This intense connection and desire allows them to withstand the pain of the process—the self-doubts, the tedious hours of practice and study, the inevitable setbacks, the endless barbs from the envious. They develop a resiliency and confidence that others lack. (Greene, 2014)
	•	In our culture we tend to equate thinking and intellectual powers with success and achievement. In many ways, however, it is an emotional quality that separates those who master a field from the many who simply work at a job. (Greene, 2014)
	•	In the past, only elites or those with an almost superhuman amount of energy and drive could pursue a career of their choice and master it. A man was born into the military, or groomed for the government, chosen among those of the right class. If he happened to display a talent and desire for such work it was mostly a coincidence. Millions of people who were not part of the right social class, gender, and ethnic group were rigidly excluded from the possibility of pursuing their calling. Even if people wanted to follow their inclinations, access to the information and knowledge pertaining to that particular field was controlled by elites. That is why there are relatively few Masters in the past and why they stand out so much. (Greene, 2014)
	•	The very concept of mastery has become denigrated, associated with something old-fashioned and even unpleasant. It is generally not seen as something to aspire to. (Greene, 2014)
	•	The first move toward mastery is always inward—learning who you really are and reconnecting with that innate force. Knowing it with clarity, you will find your way to the proper career path and everything else will fall into place. (Greene, 2014)
	•	In order to master a field, you must love the subject and feel a profound connection to it. (Greene, 2014)
	•	The road to mastery requires patience. You will have to keep your focus on five or ten years down the road, when you will reap the rewards of your efforts. (Greene, 2014)
	•	To attain mastery, you must adopt what we shall call Resistance Practice. The principle is simple—you go in the opposite direction of all of your natural tendencies when it comes to practice. First, you resist the temptation to be nice to yourself. You become your own worst critic; you see your work as if through the eyes of others. You recognize your weaknesses, precisely the elements you are not good at. Those are the aspects you give precedence to in your practice. You find a kind of perverse pleasure in moving past the pain this might bring. Second, you resist the lure of easing up on your focus. You train yourself to concentrate in practice with double the intensity, as if it were the real thing times two. In devising your own routines, you become as creative as possible. You invent exercises that work upon your weaknesses. You give yourself arbitrary deadlines to meet certain standards, constantly pushing yourself past perceived limits. In this way you develop your own standards for excellence, generally higher than those of others. In the end, your five hours of intense, focused work are the equivalent of ten for most people. Soon enough you will see the results of such practice, and others will marvel at the apparent ease in which you accomplish your deeds. (Greene, 2014)
	•	Masters are those who by nature have suffered to get to where they are. They have experienced endless criticisms of their work, doubts about their progress, setbacks along the way. They know deep in their bones what is required to get to the creative phase and beyond. (Greene, 2014)
	•	Although time is the critical factor in attaining Mastery and this intuitive feel, the time we are talking about is not neutral or simply quantitative. (Greene, 2014)
	•	The time that leads to mastery is dependent on the intensity of our focus. (Greene, 2014)
	•	People who spend years studying a particular subject or field develop so many of these memory networkds and pathways that their brains are constantly searching for an discovering connections between various pieces of information. When confronted with a high-level problem, the search goes in a hundred directions below conscious awareness, guided by an intuitive snese of where the answer might lie. (Greene, 2014)
	•	The extremely high number of experiences and memory networkds that become hardwired allow the brains of Masters to explore and areathat is so wide that it has the dimensions and feel of reality itself, of the dunamic. (Greene, 2014)
	•	Mastery is not a function of genius or talent. It is a function of time and intense focus applied to a particular field of knowledge. But there is another element, an X factor that Masters inevitably prossess, that sems mystical but that is accessible to us all.

(Greene, 2014)
	•	The ability to connect deeply to your environment is the most primal and in many ways the most powerful form of mastery the brain can bring us. (Greene, 2014)
	•	Mastery is like swimming – it is too difficult to move forward when we are creating our own resistance or swimming against the current. Know your strengths and move with them. (Greene, 2014)
	•	If we take our practice far enough the skill becomes automatic, and we have the sensation that the mind and the body are operating as one. (Greene, 2014)
	•	At the very end of this process, when there are no more simple skills to learn, the brain has assimilated an incredible amount of information, all of which has become internalized, part of our nervous system. The whole complex skill is now insde us and at our fingertips. We are thinking, but in a different way – with the body and mind completely fused. We are transformed. We possess a form of intelligence that allows us to approximate the instinctual power of animals, but only through a conscious, deliberate, and extended practice. (Greene, 2014)

Malpractice
	•	Malpractice is a civil tort, for which the standard of proof is ‘‘preponderance of the evidence,’’ or ‘‘more likely than not,’’ a weaker standard than ‘‘clear indication’’ or ‘‘clear and convincing.’’ Standard legal textbooks concerned with malpractice therefore define ‘‘reasonable medical certainty’’ as ‘‘more likely than not,’’ in defiance of the plain meaning of the words. (Weiss, 2008)

Material damage
	•	Mateiral damages can be measured by the financial costs of damages, losses, or replacements. (Newsome, 2013)
Materialist conception of practices
	•	materialist conception of practices as practical in the sense of being somehow beyond ideas. (Power, 2009)
Mathematic
	•	Mathematics is the ultimate science fiction. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
	•	One of the basic rules in the history of mathematics seems to be that important, simple, general ideas first arise in a far more complicated form. (Stewart, 2013)
Mathematical model
	•	Mathematical models allow us to worry about what the real future will bring not by considering possible worlds, of which there may be only one, but by contrasting different simulations of our model, of which there can be as many as we can afford.  (Smith and Smith, 2007)
	•	There is no more greater an error in science, than to believe that just because some mathematical calculation has been completed, some aspect of Nature is certain. Alfred North Whitehead (1953). (Smith and Smith, 2007)
	•	As Whitehead noted, it is dangerous to interpret our mathematical models as if they somehow governed the real world. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
Mathematician
	•	Mathematicians often construct systems in such a way that it will be relatively simple for them to illustrate some mathematical point or allow the application of some specific manipulation. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
	•	Mathematicians call the number of components in the state the dimension of the system, since plotting the state vectors would require a state space of that dimension. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
Macro political risk
	•	‘macro’ political risk (when political changes are directed at all foreign enterprises) (Sottilotta, 2016)
	•	‘macro’ level the focus is on the sources of risk – that is, the magnitude of the phenomenon. (Sottilotta, 2016)
Map
	•	A map provides a visual proxy for the actual travel with details about the landmarks that you will pass by in your trip. (Heuer, 1999)
Heat map
	•	A heat map is a matrix on which we can plot risks by two actionable dimensions, usually risk owner and risk category. The level of risk can be indicated by a color (say, green, yellow, and red) or a number (say, from 1 to 3) in the cell formed where the risk’s owner and category intersect. Such heat maps are useful for drawing attention to those owners or categories that hold the most risks or largest risks and thus need higher intervention, or those who hold fewer or smaller risks and thus have capacity to accept more risk. (Newsome, 2013)
Risk map
	•	Some risks are usefully plotted in space by their real geographical location. (Newsome, 2013)
Masses
	•	Masses are not held together by a consciousness of common interest and they lack that specific class articulateness which is expressed in determined, limited, and obtainable goals. (Arendt, 2009)
	•	The term masses applies only where we deal with people who either because of sheer numbers, or indifference, or a combination of both, cannot be integrated into any organization based on common interest, into political parties or municipal governments or professional organizations or trade unions. Potentially, they exist in every country and form the majority of those large numbers of neutral, politically indifferent people who never join a party and hardly ever go to the polls. (Arendt, 2009)
	•	n s’attendait à ce qu’accèdent à la scène de l’histoire des peuples enfin autonomes et responsables, souverains, en un mot. Or, par une étrange alchimie, ces peuples sont devenus, sous nos yeux, des masses, confuses réalités, avatars du modernisme. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	les foules humaines, devenues masses, posent aujourd’hui le problème de leur puissance et de leur impuissance, en tout cas de leur expansion dans le présent, là où la science sociale ne cherche peut-être plus qu’à appréhender l’expansion du présent. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	phénomène récent, que nous présenterons dans le prochain chapitre : l’entrée dans l’ère des masses. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	voici que, par le baptême de la politique notamment, les masses humaines apparaissent dans la lumière des événements historiques contemporains. Elles deviennent même le tissu dans lequel ces événements sont taillés. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	En fait, la masse semble parcourue par les courants idéologiques que font passer à travers elle, comme de grands frissons, les catalyseurs de masses, les meneurs. Avec eux commence le drame de la masse, séduite ou terrorisée. Elle devient ainsi l’otage du leader qui, sous l’alibi de l’administration gouvernementale, va tirer les ficelles. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Pour von Wiese, la masse est une unité collective dont les membres ne se représentent pas l’existence comme durable ; c’est un ensemble réagissant uniformément à un sort identique (...). (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Selon G. Gurvitch, la masse doit désigner une forme élémentaire de sociabilité, et non un type concret de groupement. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Si l’on en croit encore une fois S. Moscovici (op. cit., p. 354 sq.), foules et masses sont des termes équivalents et, du moins du point de vue psychologique, les deux mots ont le même sens. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Pour J. Baudrillard le flou est encore plus marqué, et, pour lui, les « majorités silencieuses » ne sont qu’un « référent spongieux, (...) réalité opaque et translucide à la fois, (...) (qui renvoient à) ce néant : les masses ». (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Agrégées, sinon unifiées, par les moyens de communication et les meneurs. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	masses appesantissant sans cesse leur actualité interpellent tant par leurs manifestations organiques que par les rapports qu’elles nouent sous nos yeux avec l’histoire, oscillant entre la démocratie et le despotisme, passant de l’un à l’autre sans s’en rendre compte et atteignant l’un en poursuivant l’autre. Remarquons, en passant, qu’ainsi se trouve vérifiée la prophétie de Le Bon. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Les témoins sont unanimes. Tous ceux qui ont assisté aux manifestations de violence de la foule en attestent : l’horreur est la règle. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	C’est à croire que lorsque la foule s’assemble, pour peu que la passion s’en mêle et qu’un meneur l’excite, elle se met en quête d’un exécutoire sur lequel décharger ses tensions. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	C’est probablement ce qui explique que Sighele et Le Bon, effrayés, n’aient pas hésité à criminaliser la foule. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	La masse se nourrit de ces mythes, pour ne pas dire ces chimères, que lui proposent les spécialistes de l’information. Eux-mêmes soumis à la loi du sensationnalisme, ces derniers en viennent spontanément à dramatiser le fait qu’ils présentent pour le rendre plus intéressant, pour être plus sûrs de frapper le public. Ils choisissent donc les effets les plus spectaculaires, enrichissent artificiellement l’événement, le gonflent, le colorent, recourent aux clichés, et au style hagiographique, en un mot, ils créent une pseudo-réalité que leur zèle propulse sur le devant de la scène. Souvent, sans bien s’en rendre compte, les journalistes en arrivent à se faire les relais amplificateurs de « bruits » sans fondement et à participer au renforcement des inquiétudes. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Il n’y a, en effet, de masse, pourrait-on dire en manière de formule, que parce qu’il y a des chefs ou des meneurs. Ce sont eux qui assemblent et mobilisent : ils catalysent la foule et la dynamisent. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	En étendant ainsi la notion de libido et en la désexualisant, on peut comprendre que l’individu englobé dans la masse se mette au diapason des autres pour s’attirer leur amour. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	les individus composant les foules sont, chacun pour soi mais tous ensemble, attachés au chef. La libido a donc, de la sorte, une double direction : horizontale (des hommes entre eux) et verticale (des hommes au meneur). S. Moscovici (op. cit., p. 329) résume d’une formule : « Les hommes vivent en société, non parce qu’ils sont somnambules, mais parce qu’ils sont amoureux. » (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Le sentiment de force inhérent au fait d’être en groupe s’exalte et réactualise les vieux fantasmes de toute-puissance. En même temps que certains aspects du Moi se développent démesurément, le Ça se libère en violentes décharges où le sadisme a sa part. Chacun satisfait ainsi sporadiquement mais intensément toutes les tendances profondes que la régression le contraint habituellement à refouler. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Pour F.H. Allport (1924), le phénomène s’explique en termes d’interstimulation, chacun devenant un « stimulus » pour l’autre, ils s’induisent mutuellement à adopter tel ou tel type d’attitude. Relevant d’une psychologie plus dynamique que la « contagion mentale », cette notion permet de mieux saisir les raisons des modifications émotionnelles que connaissent les sujets lorsqu’ils sont immergés dans la masse : des hommes agissent autour d’eux créant ainsi une sollicitation qui les incite à passer à leur tour à l’action. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	L’individu dans une foule reçoit donc de la part de ceux qui l’entourent une série de stimulations auxquelles il a tendance à répondre positivement en même temps qu’il devient lui aussi source de comportement pour les autres ou, tout au moins, facteur de renforcement de leur comportement par le fait qu’il s’y est associé : on peut y voir une illustration des phénomènes de rétroaction positive (dont les effets risquent d’être indéfiniment renforcés). (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	qu’il est exaltant et gratifiant de se trouver au milieu d’un grand nombre d’individus qui, tous, témoignent des mêmes sentiments que soi. Chacun a l’impression de respirer alors avec les poumons de la foule et il peut trouver, dans ces moments de forte intensité émotionnelle partagée, les justifications et les confirmations personnelles dont il ne bénéficie pas en temps ordinaire. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Il est alors effectivement difficile, pour ne pas dire dangereux, de marquer de la tiédeur et, a fortiori, un certain désaccord. Celui qui ne s’engage pas avec les autres et reste en marge de l’action collective peut être perçu par la foule comme ne faisant pas partie du groupe. Aussi les voyeurs, les raisonneurs et tous ceux qui, en général, marquent peu d’ardeur, encourent l’hostilité de leurs voisins et se voient exposés à l’agressivité la plus extrême parfois. Sans avoir besoin d’en faire le calcul, chacun est intimement convaincu de ce que les autres attendent de lui et, bon gré mal gré, il lui faut épouser ce « rôle » et oublier sa propre personnalité. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Au même titre que la vie individuelle, la vie des groupes est marquée par l’alternance. ponctuée de temps à autre par un événement saillant. Celui-ci peut avoir un caractère purement occasionnel ou accidentel (guerre, séisme, épidémie) ou se présenter, au contraire, sous les aspects d’un phénomène récurrent. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Le Bon ramenait tout à l’hypnose et à la suggestion mais son successeur en psychologie des foules propose, à leur place, l’amour : « Par l’adjonction d’éléments érotiques, affirme-t-il, les penchants égoïstes se transforment en penchants sociaux. On ne tarde pas à constater qu’être aimé est un avantage auquel on peut et doit sacrifier beaucoup d’autres ». (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Le groupe tend donc à s’organiser spontanément dans le sens de l’accord des esprits et des attitudes. (Mannoni, 1985) les comportemetns sont “conjugués” au pluriel et multiplies à l’infini des masses dont l’avènement constitue vraisemblablement un des problems les plus marquants des temps modernes. Partout hommes et femmes sous l’influence notamment des récents moyens de communication de masse, se fondent dans les cortèges, assemblées ou publics de dizaines de milliers, voire de millions d’individus. Ces foules gigantesques sont animées d’un dynamique don’t on ne peut ignorer, à notre époque scientifique, les sevrets mécanismes. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Mais la masse n’est pas seulement une entité physique. Elle a également une psychologie et celle-ci est dominée par la détresse. (Mannoni, 1985)
Mass action
	•	Ce sont les enthousiasmes collectifs. Apparaissant sous l’influence de facteurs psychodéterminants, à des moments de grande réceptivité du public, ces faits semblent caractérisés par la mobilisation émotionnelle générale aboutissant à une action de masse. Dans un premier temps on sensibilise les individus, puis on polarise leur attention sur le but que l’on s’est fixé. Une fois atteint le niveau émotionnel souhaité, on s’emploie à ne pas le laisser trop vite retomber. (Mannoni, 1985)
Mass belief
	•	là où les choses deviennent dangereuses c’est lorsque les moyens de communication entraînent la croyance des masses et les amènent à communiquer dans une de ces grandes « messes hypnotiques" dont parle S. Moscovici (op. cit., p.279). (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	“L’important n’est pas la réalité de la vie, écrit R. Micchielli (1972, p.34), mais ce que les gens croient.” (Mannoni, 1985)
Mass catalyst
	•	En fait, la masse semble parcourue par les courants idéologiques que font passer à travers elle, comme de grands frissons, les catalyseurs de masses, les meneurs. Avec eux commence le drame de la masse, séduite ou terrorisée. Elle devient ainsi l’otage du leader qui, sous l’alibi de l’administration gouvernementale, va tirer les ficelles. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Agrégées, sinon unifiées, par les moyens de communication et les meneurs. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Pour éveiller l’intérêt on demanda à une vedette, Kay Smith, d’user de sa popularité pour solliciter les adhésions. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Leaders, chefs et meneurs sont les autres agents de la massification. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Il n’y a, en effet, de masse, pourrait-on dire en manière de formule, que parce qu’il y a des chefs ou des meneurs. Ce sont eux qui assemblent et mobilisent : ils catalysent la foule et la dynamisent. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	les masses affligées ou mécontentes se sont laissé séduire par la vision eschatologique d’un prophète quelconque. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Les foules adorent ces êtres habités par l’esprit de Dieu et sont prêtes à les suivre dans les plus folles entreprises. Par leur seule présence, ces thaumaturges, incarnations du Père idéal en langage psychanalytique, se sont révélés capables de provoquer des enthousiasmes tels que leurs adeptes ont marché au combat et à la mort en les glorifiant. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	En fait, le « grand homme » semble posséder un pouvoir attractif, émanant naturellement de sa personne, sorte de « rayonnement », que Le Bon baptisait « prestige » et que l’on a nommé, à la suite de Max Weber, le charisme. Il est commun depuis d’avoir du chef charismatique une représentation relevant des images d’Epinal. On le voit dressé au milieu de l’histoire de son peuple comme un Guide providentiel, figure de proue mystérieuse et inspirée : il s’avance auréolé de lumière, possédant des qualités quasi divines. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Pelz propose trois éléments permettant d’évaluer le pouvoir de superviseur : la capacité qu’il pense avoir d’agir sur les décisions de son supérieur, sa propre autonomie décisionnelle et son niveau de salaire. La combinaison de ces trois éléments fournissant la mesure de ce que l’auteur nomme l’« influence ». (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Quant aux apparents critères objectifs de l’investiture sociale (port de galons, décorations, bâton de commandement, siège et costume), ils sont des points de repère permettant la circulation des informations et décisions dans un groupe donné et réglant les rapports entre les différents membres, mais ils restent les témoins muets d’un phénomène psychosociologique dont ils ne nous disent rien. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	« d’ordinaire, l’autorité est pour nous un objet non de connaissance, mais d’appréciation, et, souvent, de réprobation ». (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	« le commandement n’est pas un attribut de la personnalité, mais une qualité particulière de son rôle au sein d’un système social défini ». (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	« un chef est une personne qui ne contrôle que certains types de situations sociales, en dehors desquelles il est relativement inefficace ». (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	L’accès au commandement est donc ouvert à celui qui, dans une situation donnée, possède le talent requis pour gérer cette situation. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	c’est la situation qui crée le chef et non l’inverse. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	une fois que les événements ont fait élire un meneur, celui-ci doit tout de même faire preuve de certaines qualités personnelles : activité, mouvement, efficacité, suivant R.M. Stogdill (op. cit., p. 73). (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	la difficulté ne serait pas de trouver des chefs, mais de les placer dans les situations où ils pourront assurer un commandement. (Mannoni, 1985)

Mass psychology
	•	La psychologie des masses a pour fonction d’expliquer tous les phénomènes politiques, historiques, culturels, passés et présents. On le savait », nous rappelle S. Moscovici (ibid., p. 307), on l’a toujours su. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	la politique aurait (...) remplacé la religion, mais elle lui aurait emprunté les mêmes caractères psychologiques. En d’autres termes, la politique serait une religion profane et, comme dans la religion, les hommes seraient devenus esclaves de leur propre représentation ». (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Le Bon, comme but ultime de découvrir une méthode de gouvernement conforme à la psychologie des masses. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Il ressent ainsi directement la manière dont il investit l’espace, s’y tient ou s’y déplace (migrations, mouvements sociaux), l’ordonnance de ses parties et la direction des flux d’activité et les modifications de son volume. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	« sociologie statique » semblable à l’anatomie des organes au repos, et une « sociologie dynamique » comparable à l’embryologie et à la physiologie. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	C’est dans ce deuxième sens qu’il faut entendre la biologie sociale dont l’objectif est d’étudier les mouvements qui se produisent à l’intérieur des sociétés. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	l’individu perd à la fois son esprit critique et le sentiment de soi, et se découvre, avec angoisse, manipulé par des forces hostiles et inconnues. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	nos sociétés, suivant Katz et Lazarsfeld (1955) par exemple, ne sont peut-être pas aussi massifiées qu’on veut bien le croire. (Mannoni, 1985)
Mass society
	•	Si l’on regarde autour de soi on ne voit, de toutes parts, que des masses. Qu’on s’efforce de les distinguer des foules ou des publics (H. Blumer, 1946), qu’on les appelle « hordes sauvages » (S. Freud), « hordes politiques » (B. Edelman, 1981) ou « majorités silencieuses ». (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	(J. Baudrillard, 1978), les masses sont là, nous sommes dans une « société de masse »22, « complexe humain homogène : la masse composée d’hommes-masse », suivant l’expression de S. Moscovici (op. cit., p. 41). (Mannoni, 1985)
Marxism
	•	Marx's theory is fundamentally outside of scientific thought, and it preserves scientific thought only by transcending it: what is in question is a nunder standing of struggle, and not of law. (Debord, 2012)
Maximum contaminant level goals
	•	Maximun contaminant level goals (MCI-Gs) are non-enforceable and are defined as "a level at which no known or anticipated adverse effect on the health of persons occur and which allows an adequate margin of safety— (page 4). (Williams and Paustenbach, 2002)
Meal
	•	Il y avait autour de la table cette hilarité bruyante et cette liberté individuelle qui accompagnent, chez les gens de condition inférieure, la fin des repas. (Dumas, 1998)
Meaning
	•	What this discussion illustrates is the impossibility of separating etymology from meaning, for in turning our attention to semantic problems we cannot avoid looking at prior usage. That usage cannot be separated from the process of thinking about meaning out of context, i.e. asking for the literal or basic or core meaning. When we appeal to literal meaning of a word to make a point (i.e. when we object to words like denigrate or gyp), we are involved in a process of segmentation and in so doing are appealing to etymology in the broadest sense of that term. The question of etymology in its broadest sense cannot be separated from the complex issue of linearity. (Hutton, 1998)
Meaning as use
	•	The use of the term as a widely accepted way of designating a particular event ('meaning as use'). (Hutton, 1998)
Media
	•	The channels of information are also important. Information about risks and risk events flows through two major communication networks—the news media and more informal personal networks. (Kasperson et al., 1988)
	•	Voilà un champ d’études éminemment intéressant à une époque où les moyens de communication tendent à créer des masses de plus en plus nombreuses, donc de plus en plus convoitées, donc de plus en plus menacées de manipulation. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	nous avons souligné la capacité des media à être une caisse de résonance et un coefficient multiplicateur des conséquences psychologiques attachées aux événements politico-sociaux. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Il semble que trois paramètres participent à la définition des media : la consécration d’un événement et la révélation au public sous la forme d’une information, la communication de cette information à une masse considérable de personnes fondues au-delà des individualités en un vaste ensemble, la rapidité de circulation du message. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Il est légitime d’accorder à la télévision une certaine prééminence sur les autres media car c’est elle qui a sans doute le plus fort pouvoir de persuasion. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Rien ne peut, en effet, rivaliser avec les moyens de communication modernes pour ce qui regarde l’influence sur le public. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Tout se résume, pour les media, et quel que soit pratiquement le sujet traité (politique, science, technique, social), à monter un spectacle, avec tout ce que cela suppose de mise en scène, de dramatisation, de rebondissements, de suspens, de jeu de silhouettes familières ou, au contraire, surprenantes. Les media c'es le théâtre sans le théâtre. Et lorsque S. Moscovici (op. cit., p. 281) nous dit que « l’art du gouvernement n’est plus un art de la séduction, mais un art (une science ?) de la communication », on peut se demander s'il ne profère pas un magistral pléonasme. Aucun candidat moderne à une magistrature ou à un pouvoir ne saurait se passer, en effet, d'un conseiller en matière de communication. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Et même si l’on peut dire aujourd’hui que le médiatique prime le politique, il convient de rajouter que l’un comme l’autre sont assujettis à l’impératif catégorique du spectaculaire : plaire. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	L’objectif reste la recherche systématique de l’impact qui assure aux media la fidélité de leur public. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	là où les choses deviennent dangereuses c’est lorsque les moyens de communication entraînent la croyance des masses et les amènent à communiquer dans une de ces grandes « messes hypnotiques" dont parle S. Moscovici (op. cit., p.279). (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Par nature, ce sont des agents de massification. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	les moyens de communication ont besoin des masses, aussi pouvons-nous dire, en schématisant à peine, qu’ils créent les masses (ou contribuent fortement à le faire) sur lesquelles ils agissent ensuite. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	l'essentiel de leur rôle psychosociologique: les media unifient et uniformisent tout à la fois ce qu’ils ont au préalable créé ou contribué à créer. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	La vie sociale est, par eux, en effet, considérablement influencée à divers niveaux qui vont de la mode vestimentaire et musicale à la détermination des attitudes regardant les relations familiales, le mariage, et de celles qui régissent les options politiques. Non seulement la télévision et la presse influent sur la silhouette des femmes, leur coiffure et leur maquillage, mais elles déterminent également leur manière d’être dans l’existence de tous les jours, fixent leurs choix concernant les partenaires amoureux, les enfants, les objets de consommation. Les infiltrations subconscientes des images télévisées notamment donnent à celles-ci la force de modèles agissant dans le sens de la prescription d'une véritable way of life. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	hommes et les femmes qui constituent le public sont confrontés à un modèle auquel ils sont préssés de se conformer. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	les médias créé des modèles qui forcent les gens à se conformer. On peut se demander s’il n’y a pas lieu de parler en la matière d’effraction psychologique. (Mannoni, 1985)

Media analysis
	•	Media analysis provides an important route for empirical tests of the core idea that important social sites exist, of which the media are but one, where messages about risk are constructed, communicated and transformed (Pidgeon et al., 2003)
News media
	•	The news media tend to become battlegrounds where various participants vie for advantage. (Kasperson et al., 1988)
	•	The news media as risk articulators have received the bulk of scientific attention for their critical role in public opinion formation and community agenda setting. Since the media tend to accord dispro- portionate coverage to rare or dramatic risks, or risk events, it is not surprising that people's estimates of the principal causes of death are related to the amount of media coverage they receive. (Kasperson et al., 1988)
	•	press stands preeminent among the various institutions which are commonly designated as leaders or molders of the public mind. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	the daily press and the other leading forces merely accept, reflect and intensify established public opinion and are, therefore, responsible for the uniformity of public reaction. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	He says:1 “The modern man has in the printing press a wonderfully effective means for perpetuating crowd-movements and keeping great masses of people constantly under the sway of certain crowd-ideas. Every crowd-group has its magazines, press agents, and special ‘literature’ with which it continually harangues its members and possible converts. Many books, and especially certain works of fiction of the ‘best seller’ type, are clearly reading mob phenomena.” (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	The public and the press, or for that matter, the public and any force that modifies pubic opinion, interact. Action and interaction are continually going on between the forces projected out to the public and the public itself. The public relations counsel must understand this fact in its broadest and most detailed implications. He must understand not only what these various forces are, but he must be able to evaluate their relative powers with fair accuracy. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	The truth is that while it appears to be forming the public opinion on fundamental matters, the press is often conforming to it. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	Ralph Pulitzer nevertheless agrees with Mr. Mencken that the opinion of the press is set by the public; and he justifies “muckraking”2 by finding it neither “extraordinary nor culpable that people and press should be more interested in the polemical than in the platitudinous; in blame than in painting the lily; in attack than in sending laudatory coals to Newcastle.” (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	of the modern press on its less commendable side, we are bound to admit that newspapers, like governments, fairly reflect the people they serve. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	“The editor does not nonchalantly project his thoughts into the void. He listens for the echo of his words. His reaction to his supporters is not unlike Gladstone’s definition of the intimate connection between the orator and his audience. As the speaker gets from his hearers in mist what he gives back in shower, so the newspaper receives from the public as well as it gives back to it. Too often it gets as dust what it gives back as mud; but that does not alter the relations. Action and reaction are all the while going on between the press and its patrons. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	What they want and what they get are fused by some mysterious alchemy. The press, the lecturer, the screen and the public lead and are led by each other. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	many splendid newspapers have accomplished as leaders in public movements. The New York Evening Post is another example, it having long led popular demand for vocational guidance and control. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	the suppression of news applies equally to the suppression of individual desire. Neither will suppress. With the normal person, the result of this social suppression is to produce an individual who conforms with sufficient closeness to the standards of his group to enable him to remain comfortably within it. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	The standards of fitness created in the minds of the publishers express the point of view of a mass of readers, and this enables the newspapers to achieve and maintain circulation and financial success. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	In the press there is a very human tendency to compromise between giving the public what it wants and giving the public what it should want. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	“Every newspaper when it reaches the reader is the result of a whole series of selections as to what items shall be printed, in what position they shall be printed, how much space each shall occupy, what emphasis each shall have. There are no objective standards here. There are conventions. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
Media attention
	•	If the media attention is elsewhere on other hazards, attenuation may occur almost by default. (Breakwell, 2014)
	•	The truth is that while it appears to be forming the public opinion on fundamental matters, the press is often conforming to it. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
Mass media
	•	The mass media are highly differentiated (not just between types of media – the press, the radio and TV, and increasingly the web-based providers – but between forms within these types). (Breakwell, 2014)
	•	Since the structure of media provision has changed so much in the last few years as information technologies and the public uptake of those technologies have changed, it is truly uncertain how the media work to amplify risk or to generate ripple effects. (Breakwell, 2014)

(Mannoni, 1985)

	•	Les mass media exercent, en outre, une influence sur l’opinion publique qui est tantôt fabriquée par eux de toutes pièces, tantôt profondément modifiée. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Le terme de mass media recouvre habituellement la presse écrite, la radio, la télévision et le cinéma. Grâce à des moyens qui leur sont spécifiques et que des techniques modernes ont surmultiplié, ces organes de publication ont vocation à la plus grande diffusion possible. Il est d’ailleurs aujourd’hui pratiquement envisageable d’atteindre toutes les parties du monde dans des délais très limités. (Mannoni, 1985)

(Les responsables de l’information) devraient éviter de fournir aux illuminés, au charlatans et aux pervers les moyens de troubler la sottise et l’anxiété d’un grand nombre de lecteurs. » (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	On ne saurait trop insister, en effet sur les pouvoir insidieux qu’ont les mass media sue le grand public et surtout, bien entendu, sur les personnalités faibles ou fragiles, ou tout simplement naïves. La page imprimée, le commentaire radiodiffusé ou télévisé acquièrent un autorité qui leur vient de leur mode de diffusion même. Que de fois peut-on entendre des gens s’exclamer : “ C’est vrai, je l’ai lu dans le journal (ou dans un livre) ou je l’ai vu à la television “, comme si le simple fait d’être “publié” par un organisme de presse official pouvait suffire à accréditer une nouvelle ou un événement. Ceux-ci peuvent être faux par ailleurs, le “baptême” que leur donne les media les transforme en une réalité que l’on accepte le plus souvent sans critique, sans la necessaire reserve qu’appelle l’insuffisance d’attestations. Ce sont même parfois des suppositions de jounralistes qui sont prises pour argent comptant. A moins que ces derniers, toujours en mal de sensationnel, ne se fassent plus ou moins innocemment les relais d’élucubrations diverses. On assiste, par exemple, actuellement à une veritable campagne de demoralisation et de propagation d’angoisse centrée sur l’éventualité d’une guerre nucléaire. (Mannoni, 1985) 
	•	Basées surtout sur la peur liée au context historico-social, les psychoses collectives puisent également leurs sources dans le gout du mystère, de l’extraordinaire et la fascination du spectaculaire.

	•	Tout n’est décidément pas bon à dire, n’importe comment, à n’importe qui. En aucune manière le sensationnel (même vrai) ne peut avoir priorité sur la santé mentale publique. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	La pluplart des auteurs qui se sont préoccupés de la questoin sont d’accord pour souligner la psycho-toxicité des organismes d’information. C’est l’avis notamment de R. MUcchielli (1972, p. 66) qui écrit : « les mass media sont seuls capables de fabriquer une opinion publique, de créer une psychose collective sans qu’il y ait foule rassemblée. C’est là une des caractéristiques spécifiques de nos modernes moyens de diffusion del ‘information. Ils agissent sur chaque individu en particulier et isolément, tout en créant des phénomènes collectifs. » (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Déjà avant lui, G. Tarde définissait le role de la presse comme l’art de “faire tourner la tête par quelque gros tapage”. Auant dire que celle-ci a, en son pouvoir, la faculté de determiner, d’une façon quasi expérimentale, certains “vertiges” qui peuvent conduire à des attitudes psychopathologiques du public. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Qu’ils soient donc mobilisateurs d’enthousiasmes, au bout desquels point régulièrement le fanatisme, ou manipulaterus de fantasmes, quand il ne provoquent pas purement et simplement des délires collectifs, les mass media sont doublement dangereux. D’abord parce que, malgré (ou à cause de) l’énormité de leur appareil, ils sont fragiles, en ce sens que, de par leur organisation même et leur nature, ils sont la cible d’influences extérieures, tandis que leur sensibilité à tout événement provoque facilement le déclenchement de leur mécanisme. Luer hyper-réceptivité les fait donc entrer en action aisément et, doit-on ajouter, imprudémment. D’autre part, ils fragilisent à leur tour ceux à qui ils s’adressent, provoquant chez eux des ébranlements psychiques parfois considerable. Cela d’autant plus facilement qu’ils jouissent, auprès d’une population naïve, mal entraînée à faire appel à son esprit critique, d’un pouvoir de suggestion important. Ainsi, intentionnelllement ou sans le vouloir, les jounralistes ont la possibilité de communiquer au public, sous prétexte d’information, le produit de leur propres inquiétudes et divagations.

Il en résulte que chaque opinion n'arrive pas à s'étendre et est vouée à une existence très éphémère. Elle est morte avant d'avoir pu se répandre assez pour devenir générale. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	la presse, autrefois directrice de l'opinion, elle a dû, comme les gouvernements, s'effacer devant le pouvoir des foules. Elle possède certes une puissance considérable, mais seulement parce qu'elle est exclusivement le reflet des opinions des foules et de leurs incessantes variations. Devenue simple agence d'information, elle a renoncé à chercher à imposer aucune idée, aucune doctrine. Elle suit tous les changements de la pensée publique, et les nécessités de la concurrence l'obligent à bien les suivre sous peine de perdre ses lecteurs. (Lebon, 1895)

	•	He says:1 “The modern man has in the printing press a wonderfully effective means for perpetuating crowd-movements and keeping great masses of people constantly under the sway of certain crowd-ideas. Every crowd-group has its magazines, press agents, and special ‘literature’ with which it continually harangues its members and possible converts. Many books, and especially certain works of fiction of the ‘best seller’ type, are clearly reading mob phenomena.” (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	The public and the press, or for that matter, the public and any force that modifies pubic opinion, interact. Action and interaction are continually going on between the forces projected out to the public and the public itself. The public relations counsel must understand this fact in its broadest and most detailed implications. He must understand not only what these various forces are, but he must be able to evaluate their relative powers with fair accuracy. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	The truth is that while it appears to be forming the public opinion on fundamental matters, the press is often conforming to it. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	Ralph Pulitzer nevertheless agrees with Mr. Mencken that the opinion of the press is set by the public; and he justifies “muckraking”2 by finding it neither “extraordinary nor culpable that people and press should be more interested in the polemical than in the platitudinous; in blame than in painting the lily; in attack than in sending laudatory coals to Newcastle.” (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	of the modern press on its less commendable side, we are bound to admit that newspapers, like governments, fairly reflect the people they serve. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	“The editor does not nonchalantly project his thoughts into the void. He listens for the echo of his words. His reaction to his supporters is not unlike Gladstone’s definition of the intimate connection between the orator and his audience. As the speaker gets from his hearers in mist what he gives back in shower, so the newspaper receives from the public as well as it gives back to it. Too often it gets as dust what it gives back as mud; but that does not alter the relations. Action and reaction are all the while going on between the press and its patrons. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	What they want and what they get are fused by some mysterious alchemy. The press, the lecturer, the screen and the public lead and are led by each other. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	many splendid newspapers have accomplished as leaders in public movements. The New York Evening Post is another example, it having long led popular demand for vocational guidance and control. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	The standards of fitness created in the minds of the publishers express the point of view of a mass of readers, and this enables the newspapers to achieve and maintain circulation and financial success. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	In the press there is a very human tendency to compromise between giving the public what it wants and giving the public what it should want. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
Social media
	•	Our continual connection to social media makes us prone to new forms of viral emotional effects. These are not media designed for calm reflection. With their constant presence, we have less and less mental space to step back and think. (Greene, 2018)
	•	not many people discuss or analyze envy as a major social factor. But the truth is that envy is more prevalent now than ever before, largely because of social media. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Through social media we have a continual window into the lives of friends, pseudofriends, and celebrities. And what we see is not some unvarnished peek into their world but a highly idealized image that they present. We see only the most exciting images from their vacations, the happy faces of their friends and children, accounts of their continual self-improvement, the fascinating people they are meeting, the great causes and projects they are involved in, the examples of success in their endeavors. Are we having as much fun? Are our lives as seemingly fulfilled as theirs? Are we perhaps missing out on something? We generally believe, and for good reason, that we are all entitled to share in the good life, but if our peers seem to have more, someone or something must be to blame. (Greene, 2018)
	•	more than anything it is social media that spreads the grandiosity virus. Through social media we have almost limitless powers to expand our presence, to create the illusion that we have the attention and even adoration of thousands or millions of people. We can possess the fame and ubiquity of the kings and queens in the past, or even of the gods themselves. (Greene, 2018)
	•	People have always pursued fame and attention as a way to feel enlarged and more important. They become dependent on the number of people applauding, the size of the army they command, the crowd of courtiers that serve them. But this false sense of purpose has become greatly democratized and widespread through social media. Now almost any one of us can have the quantity of attention that past kings and conquerors could only dream about. Our self-image and self- esteem become tied to the attention we receive on a daily basis. In social media, this often requires becoming increasingly outrageous to capture eyeballs. It is an exhausting and alienating quest, as we become more of a clown than anything else. And each moment that the attention ebbs ever so slightly, a gnawing pain eats away at us: Are we losing it? Who is siphoning off the flow of attention that was ours? (Greene, 2018)
	•	Social media abets this dynamic by making it easier to spread the narrowly focused views and values of the tribe and making them viral. But these tribes don’t last long; they are continually disappearing or regrouping or splitting apart. (Greene, 2018)
	•	the authority of the group, which becomes that much more powerful in the age of social media: what other people are saying and doing must be true and respected, by dint of sheer numbers. (Greene, 2018)
	•	We can see on social media the delight people take in feeling outraged, in attacking and bringing down others. (Greene, 2018)
	•	With technology, it has become easier to express and satisfy our aggressive desires. Without having to physically face people, on the internet our arguments and criticisms can become that much more hostile, heated, and personal. The internet has also created a new and powerful weapon—cyberwar. As they always have, criminals simply co- opt technology to become more creative and elusive.Human aggression simply adapts to the newest media and technological innovations, finding ways to express and vent itself through them. (Greene, 2018)
	•	What, for example, is the role of social media other than the construction of representations of ourselves beyond our immediate everyday relations? To renounce social media these days is to renounce a significant plane of social interaction. On screens, we construct and observe ourselves as someone else: we perform our own alienation.  (Debord, 2012)
Mediation
	•	Mediation presents an alternative to the judicial process. (Baughman, 1995)
	•	The University of Washington's Institute for Environmental Mediation describes mediation in the following way:Mediation is a voluntary process in which those involved in a dispute jointly explore and reconcile their differences. The mediator has no authority to impose a settlement. His or her strength lies in the ability to assist the parties in settling their own differences. The mediated dispute is settled when the parties themselves reach what they consider to be a workable solution (Cormick 1987). (Baughman, 1995)
	•	Pruitt and Kressel (1985) have defined mediation simply as "third-party assistance to two or more disputing parties who are trying to reach agreement." Susskind and Ozawa (1985) describe mediation as a voluntary process distinguished from simple negotiation by the inclusion of a nonpartisan facilitator who serves at the pleasure of the disputants. (Baughman, 1995)
	•	A similar description is offered by Stephenson and Pops (1989): "Mediation involves intervention of an acceptable, impartial, and neutral third party who has no authoritative decision-making power to assist contending parties in voluntarily reaching their own mutually acceptable settlement." (Baughman, 1995)
	•	The direction that a particular mediation effort takes is largely dependent upon the skills of the mediator to guide participants through each phase ofthe process. (Baughman, 1995)
	•	Mediation is a process of integrative negotiation. (Baughman, 1995)
	•	Perhaps most important is the notion that mediation is largely negotiation behind closed doors. (Baughman, 1995)
	•	mediation facilitates public discussions ofmutual gain, while issues ofconflict may be reserved for discussions between the mediator and individual disputants. (Baughman, 1995)
	•	The ability to publicly cast the progress of a mediation process as "win-win" is an often important consideration for stakeholder representatives and can serve as justification to continue. (Baughman, 1995)
	•	In seeking to produce lasting and workable agreements, mediation tends to include rather than exclude interested parties. (Baughman, 1995)
	•	Agreement among the parties to use mediation embodies other decisions such as how a mediator will be selected; how the services of a mediator will be paid for; and how much each party will pay. Stephenson and Pops (1989) note that mutual stakeholder acceptance of an intermediary may help to encourage improved communication between disputants as well as broaden the spectrum of bargaining outcomes which each party is willing to consider seriously. (Baughman, 1995)
	•	Funding for mediation services may derive from governmental agencies, foundations, or non-governmental stakeholders. (Baughman, 1995)
	•	Use of mediation enables affected parties who may strongly disagree to work together to maintain control over impact inducing decisions. (Baughman, 1995)
	•	When carefully employed under the guidance of a skilled mediator, mediation affords the prospect of deriving win-win solutions to multi-party disputes. (Baughman, 1995)
	•	Mediation may be particularly useful in resolving conflicts over the distribution of costs and benefits of actions affecting the environment. (Baughman, 1995)
Mediation techniques
	•	Mediation techniques are also well suited to complex disputes involving multiple parties and the potential for conflicting scientific information. (Baughman, 1995)
Effective mediation
	•	Effective mediation requires that participating parties negotiate in good faith, having a full awareness of their best alternative to a negotiated agreement. (Baughman, 1995)
Mediator
	•	The mediator will work with all parties to identify workable trades in order to reach a common-ground and consensus. (Baughman, 1995)
	•	Mediators work with individual disputants to determine their ability and Willingness to trade things each values differently. (Baughman, 1995)
	•	Mediators suggest alternative resolutions based upon the collective insights gained. (Baughman, 1995)
	•	In order to help ensure that negotiated agreements resulting from mediation enjoy broad acceptance over time, the mediator is encouraged to identify and seek to include in the negotiations all potential stakeholders to the dispute. (Baughman, 1995)
	•	Early efforts of the mediator to identify and include all affected and interested parties can also help ensure that resulting agreements will be sustainable. (Baughman, 1995)
	•	Assistance by the mediator to participants inunderstanding whether or not they can truly benefit from the negotiated process can help ensure that all eventual participants are participating in good faith. (Baughman, 1995)
	•	The mediator will seek to achieve consensus upon the agenda to be followed. It is important to note that mediation is intended to be highly responsive to the needs of the parties. (Baughman, 1995)
	•	To promote impartiality, the mediator may suggest a list of experts from which participants select. In addition, the mediator or some other third-party can manage the work of the experts and handle financial aspects of expert engagement. (Baughman, 1995)
	•	The mediator plays a key role in working between the parties to identify and communicate apparent opportunities for trading and agreement. (Baughman, 1995)
	•	The behind the scenes work of the mediator can serve to bring the parties to the point where prdPosed solutions can be introduced for group discussion. (Baughman, 1995)
	•	The mediator's insights to each party's trading position serves to enable the formulation of proposed solutions, which, when presented for group discussion, can be fairly reflective of the consensual opinion of the stakeholders. Parties to the dispute can then debate the fine points of the proposed solutions and any alternatives thereto. (Baughman, 1995)
Group discussions
	•	Group discussions may, therefore, largely avoid discussions of differences, but focus upon common areas of interest. (Baughman, 1995)
Mediation participants
	•	Participants in the mediation then must have some bargaining leverage going into the negotiation process. (Baughman, 1995)
Mediation agenda
	•	The mediation agenda is also jointly developed by all participants. Topics to be discussed, the timing of deliberations, the extent to which outside experts will be called upon to provide information are all important elements of the agenda setting process. (Baughman, 1995)
	•	At any time in the proceedings, the agenda can be revisited and revised to reflect the evolving progress of the group. (Baughman, 1995)
Mediational mechanisms
Indirect mechanisms
	•	Indirect mechanisms include affect-related cognitive processes that in ̄uence subsequent judgements. (Lerner and Keltner, 2000)
Memory
	•	Basic limitations of working memory affect everyone. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	The contents of memory form a continuous input into the analytical process, and anything that influences what information is remembered or retrieved from memory also influences the outcome of analysis. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Understanding how memory works provides insight into several analytical strengths and weaknesses. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	What is commonly called memory is not a single, simple function. It is an extraordinarily complex system of diverse components and processes. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Memories are stored as patterns of connections between neurons. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	the most important property of information stored in memory—its interconnectedness. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Retrievability is influenced by the number of locations in which information is stored and the number and strength of pathways from this information to other concepts that might be activated by incomng information. The more frequently a path is followed, the stronger that path becomes and the more readily available the information located along that path. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	After thinking our way back into the appropriate context and finding the general location in our memory, the interconnections become more readily available. We begin to remember names, places, and events that had seemed to be forgotten. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Any given point in memory may be connected to many different overlapping schemata. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	how knowledge is connected in memory is critically important in determin- ing what information is retrieved in response to any stimulus and how that information is used in reasoning. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Concepts and schemata stored in memory exercise a powerful influence on the formation of perceptions from sensory data. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	If information does not fit into what people know, or think they know, they have great difficulty processing it. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	There are three ways in which information may be learned or committed to memory: by rote, assimilation, or use of a mnemonic device. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Factors that influence how information is stored in memory and that affect future retrievability include: being the first-stored information on a given topic, the amount of attention focused on the information, the credibility of the information, and the importance attributed to the information at the moment of storage. By influencing the content of memory, all of these factors also influence the outcome of intelligence analysis. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	availability in memory influences judgments of probability. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	memories are seldom reassessed or reorganized retroactively in response to new information. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Understanding how memory works provides some insight into the nature of creativity, openness to new information, and breaking mind- sets. All involve spinning new links in the spider web of memory—links among facts, concepts, and schemata that previously were not connected or only weakly connected. (Heuer, 1999)

Memory organization
	•	One useful concept of memory organization is what some cognitive psychologists call a “schema.” A schema is any pattern of relationships among data stored in memory. It is any set of nodes and links between them in the spider web of memory that hang together so strongly that they can be retrieved and used more or less as a single unit. (Heuer, 1999)
Memory processes
	•	There are at least three, and very likely more, distinct memory processes. The most important from the standpoint of this discussion and best documented by scientific research are sensory information storage (SIS), short-term memory (STM), and long-term memory (LTM).30 Each differs with respect to function, the form of information held, the length of time information is retained, and the amount of information-handling capacity. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Memory researchers also posit the existence of an in- terpretive mechanism and an overall memory monitor or control mechanism that guides interaction among various elements of the memory system. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	The three memory processes comprise the storehouse of informa- tion or database that we call memory, but the total memory system must include other features as well. Some mental process must determine what information is passed from SIS into STM and from STM into LTM; decide how to search the LTM data base and judge whether further memory search is likely to be productive; assess the relevance of retrieved information; and evaluate potentially contradictory data. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	To explain the operation of the total memory system, psychologists posit the existence of an interpretive mechanism that operates on the data base and a monitor or central control mechanism that guides and oversees the operation of the whole system. Little is known of these mechanisms and how they relate to other mental processes. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	If information does not fit into what people know, or think they know, they have great difficulty processing it. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Memory processes tend to work with generalized categories. If people do not have an appropriate category for something, they are unlikely to perceive it, store it in memory, or be able to retrieve it from memory later. If categories are drawn incorrectly, people are likely to perceive and remember things inaccurately. When information about phenomena that are different in important respects nonetheless gets stored in memory under a single concept, errors of anal- ysis may result. (Heuer, 1999)

Short-term memory
	•	Sensory information storage and short-term memory are beset by severe limitations of capacity. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Information passes from SIS into short-term memory, where again it is held for only a short period of time—a few seconds or minutes. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	STM stores only the interpretation of the image. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	If a sentence is spoken, SIS retains the sounds, while STM holds the words formed by these sounds. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Like SIS, short-term memory holds information temporarily, pending further processing. This processing includes judgments concerning meaning, relevance, and significance, as well as the mental actions necessary to integrate selected portions of the information into long-term memoryy. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	A central characteristic of STM is the severe limitation on its ca- pacity. A person who is asked to listen to and repeat a series of 10 or 20 names or numbers normally retains only five or six items. Commonly it is the last five or six. If one focuses instead on the first items, STM becomes saturated by this effort, and the person cannot concentrate on and recall the last items. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	People make a choice where to focus their attention. They can concentrate on remembering or interpreting or taking notes on information received moments ago, or pay attention to information currently being received. Limitations on the capacity of short-term memory often preclude doing both.  (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Retrieval of information from STM is direct and immediate because the information has never left the conscious mind. Information can be maintained in STM indefinitely by a process of “rehearsal”—repeating it over and over again. But while rehearsing some items to retain them in STM, people cannot simultaneously add new items. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	The severe limita- tion on the amount of information retainable in STM at any one time is physiological, and there is no way to overcome it. (Heuer, 1999)

Long-term memory
	•	long-term memory, for all practical purposes, has a virtually infinite capacity. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	With long-term memory, the problems concern getting information into it and retrieving information once it is there, not physical limits on the amount of information that may be stored. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Some information retained in STM is processed into long-term memory. This information on past experiences is filed away in the recesses of the mind and must be retrieved before it can be used. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	In contrast to the immediate recall of current experience from STM, retrieval of information from LTM is indirect and sometimes laborious. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Loss of detail as sensory stimuli are interpreted and passed from SIS into STM and then into LTM is the basis for the phenomenon of selective perception discussed in the previous chapter. It imposes limits on subsequent stages of analysis, inasmuch as the lost data can never be retrieved. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	People can never take their mind back to what was actually there in sensory information storage or short-term memory. They can only retrieve their interpretation of what they thought was there as stored in LTM. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	There are no practical limits to the amount of information that may be stored in LTM. The limitations of LTM are the difficulty of processing information into it and retrieving information from it. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	The key factor in transferring information from short-term to long-term memory is the development of associations between the new information and schemata already available in memory. This, in turn, depends upon two variables: the extent to which the information to be learned relates to an already existing schema, and the level of processing given to the new information.(Heuer, 1999)
	•	Schemata in long-term memory that are so essential to effective analysis are also the principal source of inertia in recognizing and adapting to a changing environment. (Heuer, 1999)


Sensory Information Storage 
	•	Sensory information storage holds sensory images for several tenths of a second after they are received by the sensory organs. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Sensory information storage explains why a movie film shot at 16 separate frames per second appears as continuous movement rather than a series of still pictures. A visual trace is generally retained in SIS for about one-quarter of a second. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	The function of SIS is to make it possible for the brain to work on processing a sensory event for longer than the duration of the event itself. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	SIS holds the complete image. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	If a sentence is spoken, SIS retains the sounds, while STM holds the words formed by these sounds. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Like SIS, short-term memory holds information temporarily, pend- ing further processing. This processing includes judgments concerning meaning, relevance, and significance, as well as the mental actions necessary to integrate selected portions of the information into long-term memoryy. (Heuer, 1999)


Working memory
	•	Limited information is available on what is commonly thought of as “working memory”—the collection of information that an analyst holds in the forefront of the mind as he or she does analysis. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	That limitation on working memory is the source of many problems. (Heuer, 1999)
External memory aids
	•	To help offset these limits on my working memory, I have accumulated a large number of written notes containing ideas and half-written paragraphs. Only by using such external memory aids am I able to cope with the volume and complexity of the information I want to use. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	The recommended technique for coping with this limitation of working memory is called externalizing the problem—getting it out of one’s head and down on paper in some simplified form that shows the main elements of the problem and how they relate to each other. (Heuer, 1999)
Availability
	•	“availability” refers to imaginability or retrievability from memory. (Heuer, 1999)
Human memory
	•	Human working memory is limited. We can only keep in mind several pieces of information at the same time. Through an image we can simultaneously imagine many things at once, at a glance. The use of images to make sense of the world is perhaps our most primitive form of intelligence, and can help us conjure up ideas that we can later verbalize. Words also are abstract; an image or model makes our idea suddenly more concrete, which satisfies our need to see and feel things with our senses. (Greene, 2014)
Mental account
	•	For Humans, mental accounts are a form of narrow framing; they keep things under control and manageable by a finite mind. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	Mental accounts are used extensively to keep score. (Kahneman, 2012)
Mental judo
	•	Some people are particularly resistant to any form of influence. They are most often people with deeper levels of insecurity and low self-opinion. This can manifest itself in a rebellious attitude. Such types feel as if it is them against the world. They must assert their will at all costs and resist any kind of change. They will do the opposite of what people suggest. They will seek advice for a particular problem or symptom, only to find dozens of reasons of why the advice given won’t work for them. The best thing to do is to play a game of mental judo with them. In judo you do not counter people’s moves with a thrust of your own but rather encourage their aggressive energy (resistance) in order to make them fall on their own. (Greene, 2018)
Mental model
	•	In essence, Heuer sees reliance on mental models to simplify and interpret reality as an unavoidable conceptual mechanism for intelligence analysts—often useful, but at times hazardous. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Herbert Simon first advanced the concept of “bounded” or limited rationality.  Because of limits in human mental capacity, he argued, the mind cannot cope directly with the complexity of the world. Rather, we construct a simplified mental model of reality and then work with this model. We behave rationally within the confines of our mental model, but this model is not always well adapted to the requirements of the real world. The concept of bounded rationality has come to be recognized widely, though not universally, both as an accurate portrayal of human judgment and choice and as a sensible adjustment to the limitations inherent in how the human mind functions. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	This process may be visualized as perceiving the world through a lens or screen that channels and focuses and thereby may distort the im- ages that are seen. To achieve the clearest possible image of China, for example, analysts need more than information on China. They also need to understand their own lenses through which this information passes. These lenses are known by many terms—mental models, mind-sets, biases, or analytical assumptions. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	a mental model is likely to be better developed and articulated than a mind-set. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	mind-sets and mental models are inescapable. They are, in essence, a distillation of all that we think we know about a subject. The problem is how to ensure that the mind remains open to alternative interpretations in a rapidly changing world. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	it can color and control our perception to the extent that an experienced specialist may be among the last to see what is really happening when events take a new and un- expected turn. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	The advantage of mind-sets is that they help analysts get the produc- tion out on time and keep things going effectively between those watershed events that become chapter headings in the history books. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	For each situation to be analyzed, they have an implicit “mental model” consisting of beliefs and assumptions as to which variables are most important and how they are related to each other. (Heuer, 1999)

	•	If analysts have good insight into their own mental model, they should be able to identify and describe the variables they have considered most important in making judgments. (Heuer, 1999)

Mental models of hazards
	•	If mental models of hazards are generated through processes of social representation, they will be substantially shared by members of discrete subcultures. (Breakwell, 2014)
	•	This idea that the mental model of a hazard is in many respects the product and property of a group or subculture should not be regarded as particularly novel. (Breakwell, 2014)
	•	This suggests that changing the representation (or mental model) of the hazard may require the use of one of three prime alternative strategies: showing that the source of the original representation has recanted and changed its beliefs about the hazardshowing that an equally powerful alternative source would support the target subculture changing its representationgiving the target subculture (or some subset of individuals in it) the informational and motivational basis for rejecting the original representation. (Breakwell, 2014)
	•	Recognising that mental models of hazards will be substantially a product of subcultural dynamics that are modified by individual identity motivations suggests that interventions in the workplace must be founded upon a clear appreciation of the group or team’s shared representations of the hazard. (Breakwell, 2014)
	•	mental models of a hazard-i.e., the sets of principles from which they generate predictions about its behavior. The organizing device for this methodology is a network representation of expert knowledge about the hazard, emphasizing concepts relevant to risk management. (Bostrom et al., 1992)
	•	this approach offers an integrated set of methods to help the risk communication designer choose and analyse risk communication content, structure, and organization.   (Atman et al., 1994)
	•	Some risk communications are content with informing recipients' decisions. Others attempt to influence the direction of those decisions; perhaps to reassure a worried public, perhaps to motivate action) Whatever the goal of a communication, its designers need to address the mental models that recipients bring to it, that is, the pattern of knowledge gaps, overly general understandings, and outright misconceptions that can frustrate learning. Furthermore, these information needs should be determined through a combination of formal analysis and empirical study. One cannot rely on the intuitions of technical experts regarding either what lay-people currently believe or what they need to Icnow. (Atman et al., 1994)
	•	The three main tenets of this approach are that (1) the recipient of a communication needs a basic understanding of the exposure, effects, and mitigation processes relevant to making decisions about the hazardous process, (2) recipients' existing beliefs affect how they interpret and use any new information, and (3) the information should be presented with appropriate text structure and reinforced with textual aids (e.g., section headings), as established in the general research on text comprehension. (Atman et al., 1994)
	•	We propose a decision-analytic framework, called the mental models approach, for evaluating the impact of risk communications I t employs multiple evaluation methods, including think-aloud protocol analysis, problem solving, and a true—false test that allows respondents to express uncer- tainty about their answers. (Bostrom et al., 1994)
	•	the set of concepts a person uses to understand and generate inferences about a hazardous process. (Bostrom et al., 1994)
	•	Our goal is to help people make decisions about risk. (Bostrom et al., 1994)
	•	risk communications should improve mental models by (a) adding missing knowledge, (b) restructuring a person's knowledge when it is too general or overly focused on peripheral information, and (c) dispelling misconceptions by deleting inaccurate pieces. (Bostrom et al., 1994)
	•	Miscon- ceptions that are left unchallenged may coexist with more accurate beliefs. We believe that the mental models approach provides a systematic way to identify and avoid these pitfalls. (Bostrom et al., 1994)
	•	the “mental models” approach embeds theoretical concepts in the context of a given domain, creating an “expert model” to identify relevant content that must be communicated (37). (Downs, 2014)
	•	This approach is particularly useful for revealing gaps in knowledge and misunderstandings that need to be rectified (38). (Downs, 2014)
	•	In essence, this approach compares the expert model of a given domain to a descriptive model of people’s actual understanding. Discrepancies between the two determine what needs to be communicated. (Downs, 2014)
Expert model
	•	The expert model is created by consulting the scientific liter- ature, typically augmented by input from experts, to identify the most relevant variables and how they are linked to one another. This model characterizes what a person would need to know to make the best decision within the domain (39, 40). (Downs, 2014)
	•	The expert model is then used to structure descriptive research, guiding inter- views and surveys to determine what people know and how they think about the problem, revealing areas where misconceptions or gaps in knowledge may be impeding general understanding. (Downs, 2014)

Mental shotgun
	•	The mental shotgun makes it easy to generate quick answer to difficult questions without imposing much hard work on your lazy System 2. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	The automatic processes of the mental shotgun and intensity matching often make available one or more answers to easy questions that could be mapped onto the target question. (Kahneman, 2012) 
Metabolism
	•	Proteins are not enough for making a cell work. The cell interchanges matter, energy, and information with the environment, through many different molecules, involved in millions of reactions. Hunger, satiety, coldness, and in general all the states experienced by the organism, depend on this set of reactions, called metabolism. The chains of reactions that convert one molecule into another, passing through a series of intermediates steps, are called metabolic pathways. However, reactions in cells rarely follow the pattern of an ordered sequence. For example, the final molecule often interacts with the initial one in order to stop the reaction. This feedback process closes a loop in the chain of reactions. The ensemble of all such paths yields an intricate metabolic network. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
Mentor
	•	The reason you require a mentor is simple: Life is short; you have only so much time and so much energy to expend. You can learn what you need through books, your own practice, and occasional advice from others, but the process is hit-and-miss. The information in books is not tailored to your circumstances and individuality; it tends to be somewhat abstract and hard to put into practice. You can learn from your experiences, but it can often take years to fully understand the meaning of what has happened. It is always possible to practice on your own, but you will not receive enough focused feedback. You can often gain a self-directed apprenticeship in many fields, but this could take ten years, maybe more. (Greene, 2014)
	•	Mentors do not give you a shortcut, but they streamline the process. They invariably had their own great mentors, giving them a richer and deeper knowledge of their field. Their ensuing years of experience taught them invaluable lessons and strategies for learning. Their knowledge and experience become yours; they can direct you away from unnecessary side paths or errors. They observe you at work and provide real-time feedback, making your practice more time efficient. Working closely with them, you absorb the essence of their creative spirit, which you can now adapt in your own way. What took you ten years on your own could have been done in five with proper direction. (Greene, 2014)
	•	What makes the mentor-protégé dynamic so intense and so productive is the emotional quality of the relationship. By nature, mentors feel emotionally invested in your education. On your part, you also feel emotionally drawn to them—admiration for their achievements, a desire to model. (Greene, 2014)
	•	The mentor is like the philosopher’s stone—through direct interaction with someone of experience, you are able to quickly and efficiently heat up and animate this knowledge, turning it into something like gold. (Greene, 2014)
	•	Mentors have their own strengths and weaknesses. The good ones allow you to develop your own style and then to leave them when the time is right. (Greene, 2014)
	•	To learn from mentors, we must be open and completely receptive to their ideas. (Greene, 2014)
	•	those above you to supply you with the necessary standards of judgment for your field. (Greene, 2014)
Message
	•	Messages have a meaning for the receiver only within a sociocultural context. (Kasperson et al., 1988)
	•	Each message may contain factual, inferential, value-related, and symbolic meanings. (Kasperson et al., 1988)
Factual information
	•	The factual information refers to the content of the message ( e g , the emission of an air pollutant is X mg per day) as well as the source of the message (e.g., EPA con- ducted the measurement). (Kasperson et al., 1988)
Inferential message
	•	The inferential message refers to the conclusions that can be drawn from the presented evidence (e.g., the emission poses a serious health threat). (Kasperson et al., 1988)
Cultural symbols
	•	cultural symbols may be attached that evoke specific images (e.g., “big business,” “the military-industrial complex,” “high technology,” etc.) that carry strong value implications. (Kasperson et al., 1988)
	•	Communication studies have demonstrated that the symbols present in messages are key factors in triggering the attention of potential receivers and in shaping their decoding processes. If, for example, the communication source is described as an independent scientist, or a group of Nobel laureates, the content of the message may well command public attention. Messages from such sources may successfully pass through the selection filters of the transmitters or receivers and be viewed as credible. A press release by the nuclear industry, by contrast, may command much less credibility unless other aspects of the message compensate for doubts about the impartiality of the source. (Kasperson et al., 1988)
	•	adding or deleting symbols may well be the most powerful single means to amplify or attenuate the original message. (Kasperson et al., 1988)

Meta-analysis 
	•	a meta-analysis is a study in which the results of several similar studies are combined to provide a result that, in theory at least, should have more statistical power because it includes far more study subjects than any of its component studies. 
	•	Meta-analyses can be useful when based on well-designed smaller studies, none of which would be large enough to detect a small effect by itself.
	•	meta-analyses are susceptible to the ‘‘garbage in/garbage out’’ principle: Build a meta-analysis with flawed studies, and you get a flawed result.
Methodology
	•	As far as one can see, the aim of all methodologies is to find princi- ples and facts which, if possible, are not subjected to change. Principles which give the impression of stability are, of course, tested. One tries to refute them; at least in some schools. If all attempts at refutation fail, we have a positive result, nevertheless: we have succeeded in discovering a new stable feature of the world that surrounds us; we have come a step closer to the truth. (Feyerabend, 1993)
	•	Methodologists may point to the importance of falsifications-but they blithely use falsified theories; they may sermonize how important it is to consider all the relevant evidence, and never mention those big and drastic facts which show that the theories which they admire and accept, the theory of relativity, the quantum theory, are at least as badly off as the older theories which they reject. In practice methodologists slavishly 'repeat the most recent pronouncements of the top dogs in physics, though in doing so they must violate some very basic rules of their trade. (Feyerabend, 1993)
	•	The idea that science can and should be run according to some fixed rules, and that its rationality consists in agreement with such rules, is both unrealistic and vicious. It is unrealistic, since it takes too simple a view of the talents of men and of the circumstances which encourage, or cause, their development. And it is vicious, since the attempt to enforce the rules will undoubtedly erect barriers to what men might have been, and will reduce our humanity by increasing our professional qualifications. (Feyerabend, 1993)
Pluralistic methodology
	•	The idea that a pluralistic methodology is necessary both for the ad- vancement of knowledge and for the development of our individuality has been discussed by J. S. Mill in his admirable essay On LibERty. This essay, according to Mill, is "a kind of philosophical text book of a single truth, which the changes progessively taking place in modern societytend to bring out into ever stionger relief: the importance, to man and society, of a large variety in types of character, and of giving full freedom to human nature to expand itself in innumerable and conflicting directions.'.' 43 Such variety is necessary both for the production of "well-developed human beings" (page 258) and for the improvement of civilization." (Feyerabend, 1993)
Methodological rules
	•	Methodological rules speak of "theories" and "observations"·and "experimental results" as if these were clear and well-defined objects whose properties are easy to evaluate and which are understood in the same sense by all scientists. (Feyerabend, 1993)
	•	the material which a scientist actually has at his disposal, his laws, his experimental results, his mathematical techniques, his epistemological prejudices, his attitude toward the absurd consequences of the theories which he accepts, is indeterminate in many ways, it is ambiguous, and never fully separated from the historical background. This material is always contaminated by principles which he does not know and which, if known, would be extremely hard to test. (Feyerabend, 1993)
Micro political risk
	•	‘micro’ political risk (when changes are selectively directed toward specific fields of business activity) (Sottilotta, 2016)
	•	‘micro’ level the focus is on the point of view from which risk assessment is made (the individual firm as opposed to virtually all firms) (Sottilotta, 2016)
Midlelife crisis
	•	A common experience for us humans is that at a certain point in life— often near the age of forty—we go through what is known as a midlife crisis. Our work has become mechanical and soulless. Our intimate relationships have lost their excitement and spirit. We crave change,and we look for it through a new career or relationship, some new experiences, even some danger. Such changes may give us a short-term therapeutic jolt, but they leave the real source of the problem untouched, and the malaise will return. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Let us look at this phenomenon from a different angle—as a crisis of identity. As children, we had a rather fluid sense of self. We absorbed the energy of everyone and everything around us. We felt a very wide range of emotions and were open to experience. But in our youth we had to shape a social self, one that was cohesive and would allow us to fit into a group. To do so we had to trim and tighten up our freer- flowing spirit. And much of this tightening revolved around gender roles. We had to repress masculine or feminine aspects of ourselves, in order to feel and present a more consistent self.In our late teens and into our twenties, we continually adjust this identity in order to fit in—it is still a work in progress, and we derive some pleasure in forging this identity. We feel our lives can go in many directions, and the many possibilities enchant us. But as the years go by, the gender role we play gets more and more fixed, and we begin to sense that we have lost something essential, that we are almost strangers to who we were in our youth. Our creative energies have dried up. Naturally we look outward for the source of this crisis, but it comes from within. We have become imbalanced, too rigidly identified with our role and the mask we present to others. Our original nature incorporated more of the qualities that we absorbed from the mother or father, and of the traits of the opposite sex that are biologically a part of us. At a certain point, we inwardly rebel at the loss of what is so essentially a part of us. (Greene, 2018)
Military action
Category of military actions
Precision
	•	Precision is an attractive quality but is attainable only in the category of military actions and some of their tactical effects. (Gray, 2014)
Military culture
	•	it guarantees friction with civilian political authority, and is doomed to yield much disappointment. (Gray, 2014)
Military commanders
	•	Military commanders never have as much high-quality tactical intelligence as they want. (Betts, 2007)
Military disasters
	•	Military disasters befall some states, no matter how informed their leaders are, because their capabilities are deficient. (Betts, 2007)
Military forces
	•	Military force can act as a leverage factor. (Coker, 2009)
	•	Military forces increasingly look like police forces. (Coker, 2009)
Military mission
Peace keeping 
	•	le maintien de la Paix: traditional peacekeeping operations conducted under Chapter VI premised on the consent of the parties and the existence of an observed cease-fire. (Gregory, 2000)
Peace restoration
	•	la restauration de la paix: peace restoration operations conducted under Chapter VII premised on the absence of a cease-fire and the absence of consent where the UN is intent on restoring peace without identifying a particular aggressor. (Gregory, 2000)
Peace imposition
	•	l’imposition de la paix: peace imposition operations conducted under Chapter VII where UN forces re-establish or impose peace by the threat or use of force against an identified aggresso. (Gregory, 2000)
Military planning
	•	Military planning is too exclusive in focus; were it the favoured concept wording it would endanger the inclusivity mandated by the nature and character of the subject. (Gray, 2014)
	•	The military planning within the much broader functional category of defence planning is perpetually and unavoidably ill-fitted for its future context of high concern. (Gray, 2014)
	•	Given the awesome heights of personal and particular organizational stakes in military planning, it is easy to understand why soldiers seek certainty and consistency of purpose and decision, and favour steady identification of well-enough comprehended adversaries. (Gray, 2014)
Millionaire
	•	All through the summer and early fall of 1719 the Englishman John Blunt (1665–1733), one of the lead directors of the South Sea Company, followed the latest news from Paris with increasing anxiety. The French were in the midst of a spectacular economic boom, fueled primarily by the success of the Mississippi Company, an enterprise started by the expatriate Scotsman John Law to exploit the riches in the Louisiana territories controlled by the French. Law sold shares in the company, and as its price kept rising, Frenchmen of all classes were cashing out and becoming fabulously wealthy. The word millionaire itself was coined in these months to refer to such nouveaux riches. (Greene, 2018)
Mimetism
	•	la pression à la conformité peut être éclairée encore par le mécanisme de l’identification. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Relevons encore le phénomène de mimétisme auquel se réfèrent les biologistes du comportement (éthologues) suivant lesquels de nombreuses espèces animales ont des formes copiant les éléments du milieu. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Les efforts d’assimilation que font, par exemple, l’étranger ou l’immigrant vis-à-vis de leur culture d’accueil est tout à fait significatif : en adoptant les tournures linguistiques et les coutumes de ses hôtes, celui-ci se défend contre sa crainte d’être rejeté. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Le groupe tend donc à s’organiser spontanément dans le sens de l’accord des esprits et des attitudes. (Mannoni, 1985)
Mind
	•	The mind and the body are one, and your thoughts affect your physical responses. People can recover much more quickly from illness through sheer desire and willpower.  (Greene, 2018)
Conventional Mind 
	•	Under pressure to make a living and conform to society, we force our minds into tighter and tighter grooves. (Greene, 2014)
Dimensional Mind 
	•	Such a mind is not constricted by limited experience or habits. It can branch out in all directions and make deep contact with reality. It can explore more dimensions of the world. It is active, transforming everything it digests into something new and original, creating instead of consuming. (Greene, 2014)
	•	The powers that the Dimensional Mind can bring are nearly limitless, and within the reach of almost all of us. (Greene, 2014)
	•	The Dimensional Mind has two essential requirements: one, a high level of knowledge about a field or subject; and two, the openness and flexibility to use this knowledge in new and original ways. The knowledge that prepares the ground for creative activity largely comes from a rigorous apprenticeship in which we have mastered all of the basics. Once the mind is freed from having to learn these basics, it can focus on higher, more creative matters. (Greene, 2014)
	•	To awaken the Dimensional Mind and move through the creative process requires three essential steps: first, choosing the proper Creative Task, the kind of activity that will maximize our skills and knowledge; second, loosening and opening up the mind through certain Creative Strategies; and third, creating the optimal mental conditions for a Breakthrough or Insight. Finally, throughout the process we must also be aware of the Emotional Pitfalls—complacency, boredom, grandiosity, and the like—that continually threaten to derail or block our progress. If we can move through the steps while avoiding these traps, we cannot fail to unleash powerful creative forces from within. (Greene, 2014)
Human mind
	•	human mind is naturally creative, constantly looking to make associations and connections between things and ideas. What kills the creative force is not age or a lack of talent, but our own spirit, our own attitude. We become too comfortable with the knowledge we have gained in our apprenticeships. We grow afraid of entertaining new ideas and the effort that this requires. (Greene, 2014)
Individual mind
	•	Public opinion is the product of individual minds. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	Individual minds make up the group mind. And the established order of things is maintained by the inertia of the group. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
Original mind
	•	If we think deeply about our childhood, not just about our memories of it but how it actually felt, we realize how differently we experienced the world back then. Our minds were completely open, and we entertained all kinds of surprising, original ideas. Things that we now take for granted often caused us to wonder. Our heads teemed with questions about the world around us. Not yet having commanded language, we thought in ways that were preverbal—in images and sensations. When we attended the circus, a sporting event, or a movie, our eyes and ears took in the spectacle with utmost intensity. Colors seemed more vibrant and alive. We had a powerful desire to turn everything around us into a game, to play with circumstances. Let us call this quality the Original Mind. (Greene, 2014)
	•	This mind looked at the world more directly—not through words and received ideas. It was flexible and receptive to new information. (Greene, 2014)
	•	Retaining a memory of this Original Mind, we cannot help but feel nostalgia for the intensity with which we used to experience the world. (Greene, 2014)  
Mindset
	•	mind-sets are neither good nor bad; they are unavoidable. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	People have no conceivable way of coping with the volume of stimuli that impinge upon their senses, or with the volume and complexity of the data they have to analyze, without some kind of simplifying preconceptions about what to expect, what is important, and what is related to what. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Mind-sets tend to be quick to form but resistant to change. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Once an observer has formed an image—that is, once he or she has developed a mind-set or expectation concerning the phenomenon being observed—this condi- tions future perceptions of that phenomenon. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	A fresh perspective is sometimes useful; past experience can handicap as well as aid analysis. This tendency to assimilate new data into pre-existing images is greater “the more ambiguous the information, the more confident the actor is of the validity of his image, and the greater his commitment to the established view. (Heuer, 1999)
Mindfulness 
	•	Mindfulness is the result of a never- ending effort to challenge expectations and to consider alternative possibilities. Such eternal vigilance helps eliminate “blind spots” that result in organizations missing early warning signs of unexpected and unwanted change. A mindful orientation “redirects attention from the expected to the irrelevant, from the confirming to the disconfirming, ...from the more certain to the less certain, ...and from the consensual to the contested.” (Fishbein and Treverton, 2004)
	•	Weick and Sutcliffe identify several attributes of organizational culture that contribute to mindfulness. Two that appear to be critical to anticipating uncertainty, as opposed to reacting to it, are most relevant to intelligence organizations: A preoccupation with failure, both past and potential. (Fishbein and Treverton, 2004)
	•	The concept of mindfulness, as practiced by HROs, provides a construct for designing processes in intelligence practice to improve understanding and warning for complex, transnational issues. (Fishbein and Treverton, 2004)
Minimax theory
	•	Minimax Theorem: for any game there exists a mixed strategy that permits both players simultaneously to make their maximum losses as small as possible. (Stewart, 2013)
Mirror-imaging
	•	the misperception that the enemy will behave exactly as you would yourself. (Goodman, 2007)
	•	mirror-imaging: the misperception that the enemy will behave as you would yourself in his place. (Omand, 2014)
	•	Heuer sees mirror-imaging as an example of an unavoidable cognitive trap. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Whether this was ‘‘mirror-imaging’’ (imposing an American definition of rationality on an adversary) (George, 2004)
	•	To say, “if I were a Russian intelligence officer ...” or “if I were running the Indian Government ...” is mirror-imaging. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	mirror-imaging leads to dangerous assumptions, because people in other cultures do not think the way we do. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Failure to understand that others perceive their national interests differently from the way we perceive those interests is a constant source of problems in intelligence analysis. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	If the analyst cannot gain insight into what the other country is thinking, mirror-imaging may be the only alternative, but analysts should never get caught putting much confidence in that kind of judgment. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Do not fill gaps in your knowledge by assuming that the other side is likely to act in a certain way because that is how the US Government would act, or other Americans would act, under similar circumstances. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Do not assume that every foreign government action is based on a rational decision in pursuit of identified goals. Recognize that government actions are sometimes best explained as a product of bargaining among semi-independent bureaucratic entities, following standard operating procedures under inappropriate circumstances, unintended consequences, failure to follow orders, confusion, accident, or coincidence. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Intelligence analysts have often spent less time living in and absorbing the culture of the countries they are working on than outside experts on those countries. If analysts fail to understand the foreign culture, they will not see issues as the foreign government sees them. Instead, they may be inclined to mirror-image—that is, to assume that the other country’s leaders think like we do. The analyst assumes that the other country will do what we would do if we were in their shoes. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Mirror-imaging is a common source of analytical error, and one that reportedly played a role in the Intelligence Community failure to warn of imminent Indian nuclear weapons testing in 1998. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	an inclination to assume that foreign leaders would behave pretty much as we imagine our own leaders would behave in similar circumstances, especially when the stakes are high if major errors are made in “rational” decisionmaking. (Artner et al., 2016)

Misinformation
	•	When people feel uninformed about a risk, they tend to overestimate low risks, while underestimating high risks (assessment bias). (Newsome, 2013)
Mistake
	•	Mistakes and failures are precisely your means of education. (Greene, 2014)
	•	Mistakes and failures elicit the need to explain. (Greene, 2018)
Mitigation
	•	For the UN, mitigation is the “measures taken in advance of a disaster aimed at decreasing or eliminating its impact on society and environment” (UN DHA, 1992) or “the lessening or limitation of the adverse impacts of hazards and related disasters” (UN ISDR, 2009, p. 8). (Newsome, 2013)
	•	For the U.S. government, mitigation is “any action taken to eliminate or reduce the long-term risk to human life and property from hazards” (U.S. FEMA, 1999), “ongoing and sustainded action to reduce the proability of or lessen the impact of an adverse incident” (U.S. DHS, 2009, p. 110), or “the capabilities necessary to reduce loss of life and property by lessening the impact of disasters” (U.S. DHS, 2011). (Newsome, 2013)
	•	For Public Safety Canada (2012), it is the “actions taken to reduce the impact of disasters in order to protect lives, property, and the environment, and to reduce economic disruption” (p.63).
	•	“Mitigation … aims at reducing the negative effects of a problem” (Heerkens, 2002, p.150). (Newsome, 2013)
Mixed method
	•	Concurrent mixed method data collection strategies have been employed to validate one form of data with the other form, to transform the data for comparison, or to address different types of questions (Creswell & Plano Clark 2007: 118) (Driscoll et al., 2007)
	•	The collection and analysis of embedded qualitative responses can augment and explain complex or contradictory survey responses (Driscoll et al., 2007)
	•	Mixed methods designs can provide pragmatic advantages when exploring complex research questions. (Driscoll et al., 2007)
	•	Mixed methods research is an approach to inquiry involving collecting both quantitative and qualitative data, integrating the two forms of data, and using distinct designs that may involve philosophical assumptions and theoretical frameworks. The core assumption of this form of inquiry is that the combination of qualitative and quantitative approaches provides a more complete understanding of a research problem than either approach alone. (Creswell, 2013)

Model
	•	The model defines the categories for filing information in memory and retrieving it on demand. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	it serves as a mnemonic device that provides the hooks on which to hang information so that it can be found when needed. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	The model is initially an artificial construct. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	 With usage, however, it rapidly becomes an integral part of one’s conceptual structure—the set of schemata used in processing information. At this point, remembering new information occurs by assimilation rather than by mnemonics. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	This enhances the ability to recall and make inferences from a larger volume of information in a greater variety of ways than would otherwise be possible. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	there is a fundamental difference between a model-state and the True state. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
	•	Our models, however, are not perfect and our computational resources are limited. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
	•	Many models contain ‘free’ parameters, meaning parameters which, unlike the speed of light or the freezing point of water, we do not already know with good accuracy. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
	•	We can hardly blame our forecasters for failing to provide a clear picture of where we are going to end up at if we cannot give them a clear picture of where we are at. We can, however, expect our models to tell us how accurately we need to know the initial condition in order to ensure that the forecast errors stay below some target level. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
	•	Ideally, a model will be able to shadow: there will be some initial state we can iterate so that the resulting time series remains close to the time series of observations. We have to wait until after we have the observations to see if a shadow exists, and ‘close’ must be defined by the properties of the observational noise. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
	•	A model may undeniably be the best in the world, but that says nothing about whether or not it is empirically relevant, much less useful in practice, or even safe. Forecasters who couch predictions they expect to be fundamentally flawed with sleight-of-hand phrases such as ‘assume the model is perfect’ or ‘best available information’, may be technically speaking the truth, but if those models cannot shadow the past then it is not clear what ‘uncertainty in the initial state’ might mean. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
	•	Like all models, however, they are imperfect representations of the real-world system they target, and the observations we use to initialize them are noisy. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
	•	Models, measures, and insights from the more traditional disciplines—physics, biology, computer science, economics, and mathematics—can be used, but they must be used in novel ways to discover ‘laws’ that hold across a wide range of complex systems. (Holland, 2014)
Accountable model
	•	Karl Popper defined an accountable model as one that could quantify a bound on how small the initial uncertainty must be in order to guarantee a specific desired limit on the forecast error. Determining this bound on the initial uncertainty is significantly more difficult for nonlinear systems than it is for linear systems, but we can generalize the notion of accountability and use it to evaluate whether or not our ensemble forecasts reasonably reflect probability distributions. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
	•	We will call an ensemble prediction system accountable if it tells us how big the ensemble has to be in order to capture events with a given probability. Accountability must be evaluated statistically over many forecasts, but this is something our statistician knows how to do quite well. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
Advection models
	•	The simplest are persistence models which assume that things will stay as they are now. A simple dynamic variation on this theme are advection models, which assume the persistence of velocities: here, a storm moving to the east would be forecast to continue moving to the east at the same speed. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
Delay equation
	•	delay equations. Here both the current state and some state in the past (the ‘delayed state’) play a direct role in the dynamics. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
Lorenz model
	•	When there is no convection, the fluid is motionless and the temperature in the fluid decreases uniformly from the warmer plate at the bottom to the cooler plate at the top. The state X of the Lorenz model consisted of three values {x,y,z}, where x reflected the speed of the rotating fluid, y quantified the temperature difference between rising and sinking fluid, and z measured the deviation from the linear temperature profile. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
Model assessment
	•	The assessment of models is a problem that environmentalists share with intelligence analysts. (Weiss, 2008) 
	•	The data and models underlying intelligence analysis rarely attain the level of reliability associated with a major scientific theory, such as evolution or continental drift. More usually, they are more nearly comparable to the models used to represent environmental phenomena such as global climate or the pollution of a particular water—or airshed—models that unavoidably incorporate a variety of approximations and proxy variables and are fed incomplete or inadequate data. (Weiss, 2008)
Model climate
	•	Once the uncertainty saturates in a static state, then all predictability is lost; this final distribution is called the ‘climate’ of the model. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
Model inadequacy
	•	We must contend both with observational uncertainty and with model inadequacy. Interpreting an ensemble forecast of the real world as if it were a perfect model probability forecast of a mathematical system is to make the most naïve of forecasting blunders. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
	•	Model inadequacy can steer us away from probability forecasts in a manner not dissimilar to the way in which uncertainty in the initial condition steers us away from the principle of least squares in nonlinear models. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
Perfect model scenario
	•	Perfect Model Scenario, or PMS. It is useful to distinguish a strong version of PMS where we know the parameter values exactly, from a weak version where we know only the mathematical forms and must estimate parameter values from the observations. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
Persistant model
	•	persistence models which assume that things will stay as they are now. (Smith and Smith, 2007) 
True model state
	•	we never have access to the True state of a physical system, even if one exists. What we do have are observations. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
Modeling strategy
	•	A modeling strategy has several aspects, including setting objectives. model selection, obtaining and installing the code. calibrating and running the com- puter model, and validation and verification. (Paustenbach, 2002a)
Modernity
	•	Modernity is a word we often throw around without thinking about it – it is a simple word that refers to the many complex changes in social life or societal organisation that emerged in Europe from about the seventeenth century onwards. (Arvanitakis, 2010)
	•	"modernity" refers to modes of social life or organisation which emerged in Europe from about the seventeenth century onwards and which subsequently became more or less worldwide in their influence. This associates modernity with a time period and with an initial geographical location, but for the moment leaves its major characteristics safely stowed away in a black box. (Giddens, 1991)
	•	Modernity, as everyone living in the closing years of the twentieth century can see, is a double-edged phenomenon. The development of modern social institutions and their worldwide spread have created vastly greater opportunities for human beings to enjoy a secure and rewarding existence than any type of pre-modern system. But modernity also has a sombre side, which has become very apparent in the present century. (Giddens, 1991)
	•	Modernity is inherently globalising, and the unsettling consequences of this phenomenon combine with the circularity of its reflexive character to form a universe of events in which risk and hazard take on a novel character. (Giddens, 1991)
	•	Beck seizes this notion of modernity as a process of becoming, arguing that modernity has become so modern, so means-ends rational, that it has ceased to be modern. (Rasmussen, 2001) 

Globalising tendencies of modernity
	•	The globalising tendencies of modernity are simultaneously extensional and intensional – they connect individuals to large-scale systems as part of complex dialectics of change at both local and global poles. (Giddens, 1991)
First modernity
	•	‘First—industrial, linear—modernity’ is based on the nation-state, i.e., a territorial entity. (Griner, 2002)
	•	During first modernity, collective patterns of social life are based on nation-state societies. Therefore, social and political relations are understood in a territorial sense. (Griner, 2002)
	•	In first modernity, decisions were undertaken on the basis of fixed cause-effect calculations. (Griner, 2002)
Second modernity
	•	In the second modernity we haven’t sufficient reflective distance on ourselves to construct linear and narrative biographies. (Lash, 2003)
	•	Reflecting on the social and political consequences of this situation takes society not beyond modernity (postmodernism) but into a ‘second modernity’. (Griner, 2002)
	•	Global and transnational phenomena of the kind described make a sociological paradigm shift necessary for the study of society and politics in second modernity. The study of world risk society requires a new frame of reference that is not territorially fixed. (Griner, 2002)

Advanced modernity
	•	In advanced modernity the social production of wealth is systematically accompanied by the social production of risks (Beck, 1992)

Late modernity
	•	Late-modernity represents the same phenomenon. ‘Society’, Beck asserts, ‘becomes a theme and a problem for itself’. (Rasmussen, 2001)
Modernization
	•	Modernization means surges of technological rationalization and changes in work and organization, but beyond that it includes much more: the change in societal characteristics and normal biographies, changes of lifestyle and forms of love, change in the structure of power and influence, in the forms of political repression and participation, in views of reality and in norms of knowledge. (Beck, 1992)
	•	modernization means not just automation and rationalization, but a stage characterized by confrontation. (Scott, 2000)
	•	Modernization involves not just structural change, but a changing relationship between social structures and social agents. When modernization reaches a certain level, agents tend to become more individualized, that is, decreasingly constrained by structures. In effect structural change forces social actors to become progressively more free from structure. And for modernization successfully to advance, these agents must release themselves from structural constraint and actively shape the modernization process (Lash and Wynne, 1992)

Modern actors
	•	Modern actors are seen as autochthonous and natural entities, no longer really in culture (Meyer 1988) (Meyer and Jepperson, 2000)
	•	The modern social system at present is imagined to operate via fully realized and unfettered actors pursuing their goals (if under institutional "incentives" and "constraints," understood as back-ground conditions). (Meyer and Jepperson, 2000)
Mordern era
	•	The modern era tended to treat human nature as it did the rest of the natural world, as a standing reserve. (Coker, 2009)
	•	The modern age put an emphasis on control. (Coker, 2009)
	•	The modern age encourages us to think that we make the future ourselves: that belief after all is what makes us modern. (Coker, 2009)
	•	In the modern age, cause and effect ruled supreme. (Coker, 2009)
	•	The problem with the modern age was that it believed that every problem was ‘tame’, that every problem could be solved given enough time and resources. (Coker, 2009)
Modern man
	•	Aujourd'hui, devant la discussion et l'analyse, toutes les opinions perdent leur prestige; leurs angles s'usent vite, et il en survit bien peu qui nous puissent passionner. L'homme moderne est de plus en plus envahi par l'indifférence. (Lebon, 1895)
Modern organization
	•	Modern organizations take decisions and implement policies based upon the use and promotion of modern industrial technology (Turner and Pidgeon, 1997)
Modern societies
	•	Modern societies depend on highly complex social and technological systems to function, systems so complicated that they require an elaborate division of labour because not every citizen can know how every expert system works. Unable to trade stock or grasp the potential of stem cell research, people have to trust that the experts know how to operate financial markets or biotechnological innovations. (Rasmussen, 2004)
Moment
Present moment
	•	It would seem, then, that wisdom tends to come to us when it is too late, mostly in hindsight. But there is in fact a way for us humans to manufacture the effect of time, to give ourselves an expanded view in the present moment. We can call this the farsighted perspective, and it requires the following process. (Greene, 2018)
Money
	•	Money changes everything. (Michaels, 2008)
	•	Lending money is one way in which companies and institutions can become tightly interconnected. An interesting case is the money exchanged on a daily basis between private banks so that it can be available to meet the possible requests of bank clients (becoming therefore more liquid). If customer requests should exceed the liquidity reserve of a bank, that bank can ask other banks to lend money. Central banks worldwide require other banks to place a part of their deposits and debts with them, to create a buffer against liquidity shortages. In this sense, central banks ensure the stability of the banking system, thus avoiding liquidity shocks. The freezing of the interbank lending network was one of the first signals of the 2008 financial crisis. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
Monitoring
	•	monitoring as “continual checking, supervising, critically observing or determining the status in order to identify chance from the performance level required or expected”. (Newsome, 2013)
Monopoly
	•	monopoly, which will let the most successful trader use the rule of private property to block the rule of free access to the market and so turn his own family into a privileged dynasty or a mafia (Douglas, 2005:141)
Monte Carlo analysis
	•	Monte Carlo analysis has existed as an engineering analytical tool for many years. but the development the personal computer and software [e.g., Crystal Ball (Decisioneering Boulder. CO). @RISK (Palisades Corp., Newfield, NY) has allowed its application to new areas. (Paustenbach, 2002a)
	•	one criticism of many expo-sure assessments has been a reliance on overly conservative assumptions about exposure, as well as the problem of how to properly account for the highly ex- posed (but usually small) populations that do exist.  Monte Carlo techniques offer an approach to addressing this issue. (Paustenbach, 2002a)
	•	The probabilistic, or Monte Carlo, model accounts for the uncertainty in select parameters evaluating the range and probability of plausible exposure levels. (Paustenbach, 2002a)
	•	this model allows for consideration of the probability distributions. (Paustenbach, 2002a)
	•	The Monte Carlo or probabilistic approach deals with the main deficiencies of the point estimate approach because it shares a great deal more information with the risk manager. Instead of presenting a single point estimate of risk, probabilistic analyses characterize a range of potential risks and their likelihood of occurrence. In addition, factors that have the greatest effect on results can be easily identified. (Paustenbach, 2002a)
	•	Probabilistic modeling techniques. such as Monte Carlo analysis. can be used to incorporate and evaluate sources of variability and uncertainty in risk assessments. and the use of these tools is becoming common practice in most health risk evaluations 1997b : Thompson and Graham, 1996z Finley and Paustenbach. 1994). (Williams and Paustenbach, 2002)
Monte Carlo statistical simulation
	•	The Monte Carlo statistical simulation is a statistical model in which the input parameters to an equation are varied simultaneously. The values are chosen from the parameter distributions. with the frequency of a particular value being equal to the relative frequency of the parameter in the distribution. (Paustenbach, 2002a)
	•	The simulation involves the following three steps: 1. The probability distribution of each equation parameter, input parameter) is characterized, and the distribution is specified for the Monte Carlo simulation. lithe data cannot be fit to a distribution, the data are "boot- strapped" into the simulation, meaning that the input values are randomly selected from the actual data set without a specified distribution. 2. For each iteration of the simulation. one value is randomly selected from each parameter distribution, and the equation is run. Many iterations are performed, such that the random selections for each parameter approximate the distribution of the parameter. Five thousand iterations are typically performed for each dose equation. 3. Each iteration of the equation is evaluated and saved: hence a probability distribution of the equation output (possible doses) is generated. (Paustenbach, 2002a)
Mood
	•	An individual’s mood at any moment depends on her temperament and overall happiness, but emotional well-being also fluctuates considerably over the day and the week. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	The mood of the moment depends primarily on the current situation. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	Positive and negative moods are experimentally induced or observed naturalistically, and these general feeling states are expected to lead to more positive or negative judgements respectively. (Lerner and Keltner, 2000)
	•	People are continually affecting our moods. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Pay deep attention to the moods of people, as indicated by their body language and tone of voice. When they talk, they have a feeling tone that is either in sync or not in sync with what they are saying. This tone can be one of confidence, insecurity, defensiveness, arrogance, frustration, elation. This tone manifests itself physically in their voice, their gestures, and their posture. (Greene, 2018)
	•	When we see someone smiling and in a good mood, it tends to have a contagious effect on us. (Greene, 2018)
	•	As social animals, we are extremely susceptible to the moods of other people. This gives us the power to subtly infuse into people the appropriate mood for influencing them. (Greene, 2018)
Mood maintenance hypothesis
	•	people in a good mood are reluctant to gamble because losing might undermine their good mood. (Loewenstein et al., 2001)
Moral
	•	Stevenson’s idea is that the more civilized and moral we outwardly become, the more potentially dangerous is the Shadow, which we so fiercely deny. (Greene, 2018)
	•	le mot de moralité dans le sens de respect constant de certaines conventions sociales et de répression permanente des impulsions égoïstes. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Mais si, dans le terme de moralité, nous faisons entrer l'apparition momentanée de certaines qualités telles que l'abnégation, le dévouement, le désintéressement, le sacrifice de soi-même, le besoin d'équité, nous pouvons dire que les foules sont au contraire parfois susceptibles d'une moralité très haute. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Dans la vie de l'individu isolé, il lui serait dangereux de les satisfaire, alors que son absorption dans une foule irresponsable, et où par conséquent l'impunité est assurée, lui donne toute liberté pour les suivre. (Lebon, 1895)

Motif
	•	The simpler form of module is the motif, a pattern of connections within a few nodes repeated throughout the network. Apple Books. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
	•	Evolution seems to have selected specific motifs, because of their optimal properties, (e.g. because they use the smaller number of genes necessary to perform a certain function). (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
	•	Motifs are a kind of small-scale, local, repeated modules. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
Motion
	•	Motion caused by two competing forces often gives rise to chaos. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
Rigid motion
	•	Rigid motions preserve features like lengths and angles, but continuous deformations do not—they can bend things, stretch them, or shrink them. A triangle can be changed into a circle by a continuous deformation. (Stewart, 2013)
	•	Rigid motions are among the easiest symmetries to understand, because they have a geometric interpretation and their effects can be illustrated using pictures
	•	The possibilities become richer when we consider rigid motions in the plane. The main types, shown in Figure 14, are: 1. Translations, which move the entire plane in some direction by a specific distance. 2. Rotations, which rotate the plane through some angle about a fixed point. 3. Reflections, which map each point to its mirror image in some fixed line. Less well known, but also important, are: 4. Glide reflections, which map each point to its mirror image in some fixed line, and then translate the plane in the direction of that line. (Stewart, 2013)
Multiplicative models
	•	The multiplicative model posits that the logarithm of relative risk is a linear function of the exposures and that the effect of joint exposures is multiplicative. (Moolgavkar and Leubeck, 2002)
Music
	•	C'est une chose si délicieuse que de jouir de la musique d'un peu loin, dans une pénombre, sans être vu, sans voir, et, par conséquent, sans gêner le musicien, qui peut ainsi se livrer à tout l'instinct de son génie ou à tout l'élan de son coeur. (Dumas, 1998)
Mutilation
	•	clitoris, d’un sein)33 et il est remarquable de constater combien celle-ci est, dans l’ensemble, volontiers consentie. Le groupe met ainsi sur ses membres la marque la plus forte qui soit, l’empreinte du sang. (Mannoni, 1985)
Mutual aid agreement
	•	Mutual aid agreements are formal agreements between two or more parties who share a similar threat situation or face similar types of emergencies. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	Mutual aid agreements should be developed with other organizations that can assist in the response and recovery effort if an emergency were to strike one organization. These agreements should be very specific and identify precisely what resources will be provided to the organization in need. (Vellani, 2007)
Mutual
	•	“mutual similarity”—channel individual preferences and they tend to show more bias toward homogeneous friendship choices. (Hassan et al., 2011)
Myth
	•	La création des légendes qui circulent si aisément dans les foules n'est pas déterminée seulement par une crédulité complète. Elle l'est encore par les déformations prodigieuses que subissent les événements dans l'imagination de gens assemblés. L'événement le plus simple vu par la foule est bientôt un événement transformé. Elle pense par images, et l'image évoquée en évoque elle-même une série d'autres n'ayant aucun lien logique avec la première. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	La raison nous montre ce que dans ces images il y a d'incohérence, mais la foule ne le voit guère; et ce que son imagination déformante ajoute à l'événement réel, elle le confondra avec lui. La foule ne sépare guère le subjectif de l'objectif. Elle admet comme réelles les images évoquées dans son esprit, et qui le plus souvent n'ont qu'une parenté lointaine avec le fait observé. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Dans cet exemple on voit se dérouler bien clairement le mécanisme de l'hallucination collective tel que nous l'avons expliqué. D'un côté, une foule en état d'attention expectante; de l'autre, une suggestion faite par la vigie signalant un bâtiment désemparé en mer, suggestion qui, par voie de contagion, fut acceptée par tous les assistants, officiers ou matelots. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Dès que quelques individus sont réunis, ils constituent une foule, et, alors même qu'ils seraient des savants distingués, ils prennent tous les caractères des foules pour ce qui est en dehors de leur spécialité. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	le point de départ de la suggestion est toujours l'illusion produite chez un individu par des réminiscences plus ou moins vagues, puis la contagion par voie d'affirmation de cette illusion primitive. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Ce que l'observateur voit alors, ce n'est plus l'objet lui-même, mais l'image évoquée dans son esprit. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	observations collectives sont les plus erronées de toutes et que le plus souvent elles représentent simplement l'illusion d'un individu qui, par voie de contagion, a suggestionné les autres. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Connaissons-nous un seul mot de vrai concernant la vie des grands hommes qui ont joué les rôles prépondérants dans l'humanité, tels que Hercule, Bouddha, Jésus ou Mahomet? Très probablement non. Au fond d'ailleurs, leur vie réelle nous importe fort peu. Ce que nous avons intérêt à connaître, ce sont les grands hommes tels que la légende populaire les a fabriqués. Ce sont les héros légendaires, et pas du tout les héros réels, qui ont impressionné l'âme des foules. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Il n'est même pas besoin que les siècles aient passé sur les héros pour que leur légende soit transformée par l'imagination des foules. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Sous les Bourbons, Napoléon devint une sorte de personnage idyllique philanthrope et libéral, ami des humbles, qui, au dire des poètes, devaient conserver son souvenir sous le chaume pendant bien longtemps. Trente ans après, le héros débonnaire était devenu un despote sanguinaire qui, après avoir usurpé le pouvoir et la liberté, fit périr trois millions d'hommes uniquement pour satisfaire son ambition. De nos jours, nous assistons à une nouvelle transformation de la légende. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	l'histoire ne peut guère éterniser que des mythes. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Le merveilleux et le légendaire sont les vrais supports des civilisations.—L'imagination populaire a toujours été la base de la puissance des hommes d'État. (Lebon, 1895)
Mystery
	•	Mysteries in intelligence concern intentions of the opponent that have not yet turned into decisions, such as predicting the likely choice of target by a terrorist group before they themselves have decided, or they concern the internal stability of countries of interest and the evolution of international relationships, such as whether a dictator is likely to consider armed aggression against a neighbouring state. (Omand, 2014)
Mystical effect
	•	Use the appropriate dominance cues to make people think you are powerful, even before you reach the heights. You want to seem like you were destined for success, a mystical effect that always works. (Greene, 2018)
N
Nature
Law of nature
	•	One of the most intriguing features of the laws of Nature, as we understand them, is that they are symmetric. As we saw in the previous chapter, symmetry of the equations (laws) need not imply symmetry of the behaviour (solutions). (Stewart, 2013)
	•	it became clear that there are four basic types of force in Nature: gravity, electromagnetic, weak nuclear, and strong nuclear. (Stewart, 2013)
Natural disaster
	•	Natural disasters generate very weak attributions of external and personal control (Coombs, 1998)
	•	Both natural disasters and product tampering generate very weak perceptions of crisis responsibility (Coombs et al.,1995). (Coombs, 1998)
Natural selection
	•	if natural selection shows no evidence of intelligent design, automated evolution does. (Coker, 2009)
	•	Natural selection can provide localized improvements (as genes continue to adapt). (Coker, 2009)
Naturalistic approach
	•	When we say ‘naturalistic approach’, we mean that the researcher refrains from any form of manipulation, stimulation, interference or disturbance, and that the object is studied in its natural setting. (Corbetta, 2003)
Narcissism
	•	We all naturally possess the most remarkable tool for connecting to people and attaining social power—empathy. When cultivated and properly used, it can allow us to see into the moods and minds of others, giving us the power to anticipate people’s actions and gently lower their resistance. This instrument, however, is blunted by our habitual Self-absorption. We are all narcissists, some deeper on the spectrum than others. Our mission in life is to come to terms with this Self-love and learn how to turn our sensitivity outward, toward others, instead of inward. (Greene, 2018)
	•	From the moment we are born, we humans feel a never-ending need for attention. We are social animals to the core. Our survival and happiness depend on the bonds we form with others. If people do not pay attention to us, we cannot connect to them on any level. Some of this is purely physical—we must have people looking at us to feel alive. As those who have gone through long periods of isolation can attest, without eye contact we begin to doubt our existence and to descend into a deep depression. But this need is also deeply psychological: through the quality of attention we receive from others, we feel recognized and appreciated for who we are. Our sense of Self-worth depends on this. Because this is so important to the human animal, people will do almost anything to get attention, including committing a crime or attempting suicide. Look behind almost any action, and you will see this need as a primary motivation. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Facing this dilemma from early childhood on, most of us come up with a solution that works quite well: we create a self, an image of ourselves that comforts us and makes us feel validated from within. This self is composed of our tastes, our opinions, how we look at the world, what we value. In building this Self-image, we tend to accentuate our positive qualities and explain away our flaws. (Greene, 2018)
	•	We cannot go too far in this, for if our Self-image is too divorced from reality, other people will make us aware of the discrepancy, and we will doubt ourselves. But if it is done properly, in the end we have a self that we can love and cherish. Our energy turns inward. We become the center of our attention. (Greene, 2018)
	•	It is ironic that the word narcissism has come to mean Self-love, when it is in fact the case that the worst narcissists have no cohesive self to love, which is the source of their problem. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Measure all of your relationships on the narcissism spectrum. It is not one person or the other but the dynamic itself that must be altered. (Greene, 2018)
	•	narcissists have no cohesive self to love, which is the source of their problem. (Greene, 2018)
Narcissit
	•	In the backgrounds of almost all deep narcissists we find either abandonment or enmeshment. The result is that they have no self to retreat to, no foundation for Self-esteem, and are completely dependent on the attention they can get from others to make them feel alive and worthy. (Greene, 2018)
	•	In childhood, if such narcissists are extroverts, they can function reasonably well, and even thrive. They become masters at attracting notice and monopolizing attention. They can appear vivacious and exciting. In a child, such qualities can seem a sign of future social success. But underneath the surface, they are becoming dangerously addicted to the hits of attention they stimulate to make them feel whole and worthy. If they are introverts, they will retreat to a fantasy life, imagining a self that is quite superior to others. Since they will not get validation of this Self-image from others because it is so unrealistic, they will also have moments of great doubt and even Self-loathing. They are either a god or a worm. Lacking a coherent core, they could imagine themselves to be anyone, and so their fantasies will keep shifting as they try on new personalities. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Let us imagine narcissism as a way of gauging the level of our Self-absorption, as if it existed on a measurable scale from high to low. At a certain depth, let us say below the halfway mark on the scale, people enter the realm of deep narcissism. (Greene, 2018)
	•	we must be honest about our own nature and not deny it. We are all narcissists. In a conversation we are all champing at the bit to talk, to tell our story, to give our opinion. We like people who share our ideas—they reflect back to us our good taste. If we happen to be assertive, we see assertiveness as a positive quality because it is ours, whereas others, more timid, will rate it as obnoxious and value introspective qualities. We are all prone to flattery because of our Self-love. Moralizers who try to separate themselves and denounce the narcissists in the world today are often the biggest narcissists of them all—they love the sound of their voice as they point fingers and preach. We are all on the spectrum of Self-absorption. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Creating a self that we can love is a healthy development, and there should be no stigma attached to it. Without Self-esteem from within, we would fall into deep narcissism. But to move beyond functional narcissism, which should be our goal, we must first be honest with ourselves. Trying to deny our Self-absorbed nature, trying to pretend we are somehow more altruistic than others, makes it impossible for us to transform ourselves. (Greene, 2018)
	•	narcissists have no cohesive self to love, which is the source of their problem. (Greene, 2018)
Complete control narcissist
	•	The answer lies in the early part of their careers, before they turn paranoid and vicious. These types generally have more ambition and energy than the average deep narcissist. They also tend to have even greater insecurities. The only way they can mollify these insecurities and satisfy their ambition is by gaining from others more than the usual share of attention and validation, which can really only come through securing social power in either politics or business. Early on in life, these types stumble upon the best means for doing so. As with most deep narcissists, they are hypersensitive to any perceived slight. They have fine antennae attuned to people to probe their feelings and thoughts—to suss out if there is any hint of disrespect. But what they discover at some point is that this sensitivity can be tuned to others to probe their desires and insecurities. Being so sensitive, they can listen to people with deep attention. They can mimic empathy. The difference is that from within, they are impelled not by the need to connect but by the need to control people and manipulate them. They listen and probe you in order to discover weaknesses to play on. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Their attention is not all faked or it would have no effect. In the moment, they can feel camaraderie as they put their arm around your shoulder, but afterward they control and stifle its blossoming into anything real or deeper. If they did not do so, they would risk losing control of their emotions and opening themselves up to being hurt. They pull you in with a display of attention and affection, then lure you in deeper with the inevitable coldness that follows. Did you do or say something wrong? How can you regain their favor? It can be subtle—it can register in a glance that lasts a second or two—but it has its effect. It is the classic push and pull of the coquette that makes you want to reexperience the warmth you once felt. Combined with the unusually high levels of confidence displayed by this type, this can have a devastatingly seductive effect on people and attract followers. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Complete control narcissists stimulate your desire to get closer to them but keep you at arm’s distance.  (Greene, 2018)
	•	All of this is about control. They control their emotions, and they control your reactions. At some point, as they get more secure in their power, they will resent the fact that they had to play the charm game. Why should they have to pay attention to others when it should be the other way around? So they will inevitably turn against former friends, revealing the envy and hatred that was always just below the surface. They control who is in and who is out, who lives and who dies. By creating double binds in which nothing you say or do will please them, or by making it seem arbitrary, they terrorize you with this insecurity. They now control your emotions. (Greene, 2018)
	•	At some point, they will become total micromanagers—whom can they trust anymore? People have turned into automatons, incapable of making decisions, so they must oversee everything. If they reach such extremes, these types will end up destroying themselves, because it is actually impossible to rid the human animal of free will. (Greene, 2018)
	•	You will almost inevitably encounter this type in your life, because through their ambition they tend to become bosses and CEOs, political figures, cult leaders. (Greene, 2018)
	•	The danger they represent to you is in the beginning, when they first apply their charm. You can see through them by employing your visceral empathy. Their show of interest in you is never deep, never lasts too long, and is inevitably followed by a coquettish pullback. If you stop being distracted by the outward attempt at charm, you can sense this coldness and the degree to which the attention inevitably flows to them. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Look at their past. You will notice that they do not have one single deep and intimate relationship in which they exposed any vulnerability. (Greene, 2018)
	•	If you suspect you are dealing with this type, you must keep your distance. They are like tigers—once you are too close, you cannot get away, and they will devour you. (Greene, 2018)
Deep narcissists
	•	In constructing a self that we can hold on to and love, the key moment in its development occurs between the ages of two and five years old. As we slowly separate from our mother, we face a world in which we cannot get instant gratification. We also become aware that we are alone and yet dependent on our parents for survival. Our answer is to identify with the best qualities of our parents—their strength, their ability to soothe us—and incorporate these qualities into ourselves. If our parents encourage us in our first efforts at independence, if they validate our need to feel strong and recognize our unique qualities, then our Self-image takes root, and we can slowly build upon it. Deep narcissists have a sharp break in this early development, and so they never quite construct a consistent and realistic feeling of a self. (Greene, 2018)
	•	The nightmare for deep narcissists generally arrives in their twenties and thirties. They have failed to develop that inner thermostat, a cohesive sense of self to love and depend upon. The extroverts must constantly attract attention to feel alive and appreciated. They become more dramatic, more exhibitionistic and grandiose. This can become tiresome and even pathetic. They have to change friends and scenes so that they can have a fresh audience. Introverts fall deeper into a fantasy self. Being socially awkward yet radiating superiority, they tend to alienate people, increasing their dangerous isolation. In both cases, drugs or alcohol or any other form of addiction can become a necessary crutch to soothe them in the inevitable moments of doubt and depression. (Greene, 2018)
	•	You can recognize deep narcissists by the following behavior patterns: If they are ever insulted or challenged, they have no defense, nothing internal to soothe them or validate their worth. They generally react with great rage, thirsting for vengeance, full of a sense of righteousness. This is the only way they know how to assuage their insecurities. In such battles, they will position themselves as the wounded victim, confusing others and even drawing sympathy. They are prickly and oversensitive. Almost everything is taken personally. They can become quite paranoid and have enemies in all directions to point to. You can see an impatient or distant look on their face whenever you talk about something that does not directly involve them in some way. They immediately turn the conversation back to themselves, with some story or anecdote to distract from the insecurity behind it. They can be prone to vicious bouts of envy if they see others getting the attention they feel they deserve. They frequently display extreme Self-confidence. This always helps to gain attention, and it neatly covers up their gaping inner emptiness and their fragmented sense of self. But beware if this confidence is ever truly put to the test. Greene, 2018)
	•	When it comes to other people in their lives, deep narcissists have an unusual relationship that is hard for us to understand. They tend to see others as extensions of themselves, what is known as self-objects. People exist as instruments for attention and validation. Their desire is to control them like they control their own arm or leg. In a relationship, they will slowly make the partner cut off contact with friends—there must be no competition for attention. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Some highly talented deep narcissists (see stories starting on page 54 for examples) manage to find some redemption through their work, channeling their energies and getting the attention they crave through their accomplishments, although they tend to remain quite erratic and volatile. (Greene, 2018)
	•	For most deep narcissists, however, it can be difficult to concentrate on their work. Lacking the Self-esteem thermostat, they are prone to continually worrying about what others think of them. This makes it hard to actually focus attention outward for long periods of time, and to deal with the impatience and anxiety that comes with work. Such types tend to change jobs and careers quite frequently. This becomes the nail in their coffin—unable to attract genuine recognition through their accomplishments, they are forever thrown back on the need to artificially stimulate attention. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Deep narcissists can be annoying and frustrating to deal with; they can also become quite harmful if we get too close to them. They entangle us in their never-ending dramas and make us feel guilty if we are not continually paying them attention. Relationships with them are most unsatisfying, and having one as a partner or spouse can be deadly. In the end, everything must revolve around them. The best solution in such cases is to get out of their way, once we identify them as a deep narcissist. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Let us imagine narcissism as a way of gauging the level of our Self-absorption, as if it existed on a measurable scale from high to low. At a certain depth, let us say below the halfway mark on the scale, people enter the realm of deep narcissism. Once they reach this depth, it is very difficult for them to raise themselves back up, because they lack the Self-esteem device. The deep narcissist becomes completely Self-absorbed, almost always below the mark. If for a moment they manage to engage with others, some comment or action will trigger their insecurities and they will go plummeting down. But mostly they tend to sink deeper into themselves over time. Other people are instruments. Reality is just a reflection of their needs. Constant attention is their only way of survival. (Greene, 2018)
	•	First, we must fully understand the phenomenon of the deep narcissist. Although they are in the minority, some of them can inflict an unusual amount of harm in the world. We must be able to distinguish the toxic types that stir up drama and try to turn us into objects they can use for their purposes. They can draw us in with their unusual energy, but if we become enmeshed, it can be a nightmare to disengage. They are masters at turning the tables and making others feel guilty. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Knowing how to handle the deep narcissists in our lives is an important art for all of us. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Deep narcissism tends to sink you deeper, as your connection to reality lessens and you are unable to really develop your work or your relationships. Empathy does the opposite. As you increasingly turn your attention outward, you get constant positive feedback. People want to be around you more. You develop your empathic muscle; your work improves; without trying, you gain the attention that all humans thrive on. Empathy creates its own upward, positive momentum. (Greene, 2018)
	•	One of the strange paradoxes about deep narcissism is that it often goes unnoticed by others, until the behavior becomes too extreme to ignore. The reason for this is simple: deep narcissists can be masters of disguise. They sense early on that if they revealed their true selves to others—their need for constant attention and to feel superior—they would repel people. They use their lack of a coherent self as an advantage. They can play many parts. They can disguise their need for attention through various dramatic devices. They can go further than anyone in seeming moral and altruistic. They never just give or support the right cause—they make a show of it. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Or they go in the opposite direction, reveling in their status as a victim, as someone suffering at the hands of others or neglected by the world. It is easy to get caught up in the drama of the moment, only to suffer later as they consume you with their needs or use you for their purposes. They play on your empathy. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Your only solution is to see through the trick. Recognize this type by the fact that the focus always seems to be on them. Notice how they are always superior in supposed goodness or suffering or squalor. See the continual drama and the theatrical quality of their gestures. Everything they do or say is for public consumption. Do not let yourself become collateral damage in their drama. (Greene, 2018)
	•	your character was set in your earliest years (see chapter 4), along with your inclinations toward certain activities, your likes and dislikes. As you get older, this character only becomes more apparent. Feeling organically connected to who you were in the past gives you a strong sense of identity. You know what you like and dislike, you know who you are. This will help you maintain your self- love, which is so critical in resisting the descent into deep narcissism and in helping you to develop empathy (see chapter 2). Also, you will pay greater attention to the mistakes and lessons of the past, which those who are locked in the present tend to repress. (Greene, 2018)
Functional narcissit
	•	Above that halfway mark is what we shall call the functional narcissist, where most of us reside. We also are Self-absorbed, but what prevents us from falling deep into ourselves is a coherent sense of self that we can rely upon and love. (It is ironic that the word narcissism has come to mean Self-love, when it is in fact the case that the worst narcissists have no cohesive self to love, which is the source of their problem.) This creates some inner resiliency. We may have deeper narcissistic moments, fluctuating below the mark, particularly when depressed or challenged in life, but inevitably we elevate ourselves. Not feeling continually insecure or wounded, not always needing to fish for attention, functional narcissists can turn their attention outward, into their work and into building relationships with people. (Greene, 2018)
	•	to move beyond functional narcissism, which should be our goal, we must first be honest with ourselves. Trying to deny our Self-absorbed nature, trying to pretend we are somehow more altruistic than others, makes it impossible for us to transform ourselves. (Greene, 2018)
Healthy narcissist
	•	Healthy narcissists have a stronger, even more resilient sense of self. They tend to hover closer to the top of the scale. They recover more quickly from any wounds or insults. They do not need as much validation from others. They realize at some point in life that they have limits and flaws. They can laugh at these flaws and not take slights so personally. In many ways, by embracing the full picture of themselves, their Self-love is more real and complete. From this stronger inner position, they can turn their attention outward more often and more easily. This attention goes in one of two directions, and sometimes both. (Greene, 2018)
	•	they are able to direct their focus and their love into their work, becoming great artists, creators, and inventors. Because their outward focus on the work is more intense, they tend to be successful in their ventures, which gives them the necessary attention and validation. They can have moments of doubt and insecurity, and artists can be notoriously brittle, but work stands as a continual release from too much Self-absorption. (Greene, 2018)
	•	The other direction healthy narcissists take is toward people, developing empathic powers. Imagine empathy as the realm lying at the very top of the scale and beyond—complete absorption in others. By our very nature, we humans have tremendous abilities to understand people from the inside out. In our earliest years, we felt completely bonded with our mother, and we could sense her every mood and read her every emotion in a preverbal way. Unlike any other animal or primate, we also had the ability to extend this beyond the mother to other caregivers and people in our vicinity. (Greene, 2018)
Narcissistic leader
	•	There is one variety of this type, however, that is more dangerous and toxic, because of the levels of power he or she can attain—namely the narcissistic leader. (This type has been around for a long time. In the Bible, Absalom was perhaps the first recorded example, but we find frequent references in ancient literature to others—Alcibiades, Cicero, and Emperor Nero, to name a few.) Almost all dictator types and tyrannical CEOs fall into this category. They generally have more ambition than the average deep narcissist and for a while can funnel this energy into work. Full of narcissistic Self-confidence, they attract attention and followers. They say and do things that other people don’t dare say or do, which seems admirable and authentic. They might have a vision for some innovative product, and because they radiate such confidence, they can find others to help them realize their vision. They are experts at using people. (Greene, 2018)
	•	If they have success, a terrible momentum is set in place—more people are attracted to their leadership, which only inflates their grandiose tendencies. If anyone dares to challenge them, they are more prone than others to go into that deep narcissistic rage. 
	•	They are hypersensitive. They also like to stir up constant drama as a means to justify their power—they are the only ones who can solve the problems they create. This also gives them more opportunities to be the center of attention. The workplace is never stable under their direction. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Sometimes they can become entrepreneurs, people who found a company because of their charisma and ability to attract followers. They can have creative flair as well. But for many of these leader types, eventually their own inner instability and chaos will come to be mirrored in the company or group they lead. They cannot forge a coherent structure or organization. Everything must flow through them. They have to control everything and everyone, their Self-objects. They will proclaim this as a virtue—as being authentic and spontaneous—when really they lack the ability to focus and create something solid. They tend to burn and destroy whatever they create. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Narcissistic leaders are the most dangerous of all, and we must resist their pull and see through the façade of their apparent creativity. (Greene, 2018)
Narrative
	•	Narrative (a coherent "story") can be a very powerful means of framing risk messages. (Pidgeon et al., 2003)
	•	Narrative can captivate the audience, driving anticipation for plot resolution, thus becoming a self-motivating vehicle for information delivery. (Downs, 2014)
	•	Humans appear to be predisposed to process information most efficiently when it is presented in narrative format (4–6), especially when that information has social relevance (2, 7). (Downs, 2014)
	•	such as procedural ex- planations or descriptive lists, communicating through stories drives our narrative appetite (8), providing motivation to continue the story until resolution is reached (9). (Downs, 2014)
	•	This intrinsic reinforcement can provide a powerful tool for science communicators vying for the public’s attention and engagement. (Downs, 2014)
	•	First, narrative uses a narrator’s voice (Fig. 1, box 1) to set up a conflict within a given context (Fig. 1, box 2), and describes action, unfolding over time, to resolve that conflict (Fig. 1, box 3) (5, 7, 9). Within this general structure, narratives may take many different forms, such as fact or fiction, case studies, or dramatic conversations and first-person or third-person perspectives. (Downs, 2014)
	•	Narratives can directly address known misconceptions, explaining underlying flaws in reasoning or correcting facts. (Downs, 2014)
	•	Narratives can also guide action by demonstrating or “modeling” the behavior, forging a memorable incident in which someone engages in the relevant behavior, overcoming obstacles similar to those that others face (7). This approach is especially helpful when future behaviors will be context-dependent, such as refraining from a tempting behavior like eating unhealthy foods. In these cases, the narrative can help the individual to create memory traces that automatically bring strategies to mind when those future contexts arise. (Downs, 2014)
	•	Narratives typically do not engage systematic processing of information, and so are not conducive to eliciting verbatim memory recall (11). However, narratives should not be used merely as dumbed-down science, choosing a couple of key details and pre- tending that other aspects of the problem don’t exist. (Downs, 2014)
	•	Similarly, the conflicts central to a narrative and the context in which it takes place can help the audience to identify with it and better remember its lessons. Concepts that are already well un- derstood can serve as a foundation, making the story feel com- fortable and providing a context for new information. (Downs, 2014)
	•	Unfortunately, narratives have a greater potential to convey biased information, given their high emotional impact and limited ability to provide citations (10). For someone with a narrow agenda, a narrative can be a tempting format to moralize by presenting a one-sided case, or to harangue the audience about a particular issue without presenting a complete account. Even for topics with broad scientific consensus, such as the risks of smoking or climate change, there is often a temptation to show worst-case scenarios rather than the most-likely outcomes (45, 46). Such use of narrative may be considered highly manipulative by both scientists and audiences, and is likely to undermine trust in narratives from similar sources or on similar topics, potentially escalating hostility in ongoing debates. (Downs, 2014)
	•	To maintain trust, creators of narratives have a responsibility to be true to the science when communicating. This requires scientists to consider the strength of data on all sides of an issue and not just cherry-pick supportive incidents to make a particular argument. Presenting a worst-case scenario implicitly conveys the impression that the scenario is typical and thus misrepresents likely outcomes (47). (Downs, 2014)
	•	Because narrative must limit information more than other forms of communication, it may be more vulnerable to such selection bias, and therefore requires additional vigilance to guard against such bias. In cases where there is substantial disagreement or controversy, a narrative might even require a companion source document to link all claims and explanations to reputable, peer-reviewed original scientific sources. (Downs, 2014)
	•	Use of narrative helps to convey scientific findings in a coherent manner that can help the audience better understand and re- member complex processes that are otherwise difficult to explain. Prescriptive scientific narratives can explain science to people who can then use their improved understanding to make better decisions for themselves. By using narrative to convey scientific information, a communication can help its audience to reconsider long-held beliefs that may be inaccurate, and develop understanding that will serve as a framework for new information. (Downs, 2014)
	•	Narrative is the way we simplify and make sense of a complex world. It supplies context, insight, interpretation—all the things that make data meaningful and analytics more relevant and interesting. (Haider, 2016)
Narrative fallacy
	•	Narrative fallacies arise inevitably from our continuous attempt to make sense of the world. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	The explanatory stories that people find compelling are simple; are concrete rather than abstract; assign a larger role to talent, stupidity, and intentions than to luck; and focus on a few striking events that happened rather than on the countless events that failed to happen. Any recent salient event is a candidate to become the kernel of a causal narrative. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	You build the best possible story from the information available to you, and if it is a good story, you believe it (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	What is perverse about the use of knowin this context is not that some individuals get credit for prescience that they do not deserve. (Kahneman, 2012)
Compelling narrative
	•	A compelling narrative fosters an illusion of inevitability (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	A compelling narrative can garner more constructive attention than what is achieved by mere fear appeals, which often fail to improve decisions (17, 18). (Downs, 2014)
	•	This involvement reduces the kind of resistant reactions that may arise in other contexts (5, 7, 12), creating a self- motivating vehicle for information delivery (3, 20). (Downs, 2014)
Conversational narrative
	•	Conversational narrative appears to be more believable than testimonial narrative (26). (Downs, 2014)
Risk narrative
	•	Burgess suggests that contemporary media risk narrative requires a focus for institutional blame attribution, and without a plausible candidate amplification may not acquire momentum. (Breakwell, 2014)
Fiction and nonfiction narratives
	•	Fiction and nonfiction narratives can engage audiences about equally (22), opening the possibility for creating content without needing to remain true to the details of a particular case study. (Downs, 2014)
Narrator voice
	•	Subtle differences in the narrator’s voice can greatly affect the overall tone of the communication, affecting how the audience receives it. A voice that feels too authoritarian can be off-putting, making the audience feel like they are being told what to do. Presenting the same information in a voice that the audience more readily identifies with can greatly increase its impact (44). (Downs, 2014)
	•	Getting the voice right is especially important in domains requiring social negotiation. When communicating about interper- sonal relationships, behavioral expectations, or other social challenges, narratives can take advantage of numerous social tools. These tools include the ability to present a diversity of perspectives, the power to engage emotional reactions, and the demonstration of behavioral modeling. (Downs, 2014)

Narrative approach to science communication
	•	narrative approach to science communication may help audiences to more fully understand how science is relevant to their own lives and behaviors. (Downs, 2014)
Prescriptive scientific narrative
	•	The use of prescriptive scientific narrative can help to overcome challenges specific to scientific concepts, especially the need to reconsider long-held beliefs in the face of new empirical findings. (Downs, 2014)
	•	As with all educational efforts, prescriptive scientific narratives must be evaluated systematically to determine whether they have the desired effects in improving understanding and changing behavior. (Downs, 2014)
Interactivity narrative
	•	Interactivity can provide individuals with the content that is relevant for them, unencumbered by irrelevant information that might otherwise lead to fatigue or dilution of the message (52). (Downs, 2014)
	•	Interactivity provides special benefits for communications using narrative, but also special challenges, such as the need for nonlinear storylines to allow viewers to make choices within a narrative (53). (Downs, 2014)
	•	Allowing audiences a feeling of control in selecting options can promote both involvement and feelings of agency, while still controlling exposure to content. (Downs, 2014)
	•	Interactive narrative science communication provides impor- tant additional benefits. In particular, it allows for structured self- tailoring, delivering the most relevant information to the audience efficiently, while boosting feelings of engagement and agency. (Downs, 2014)
Narrative communication 
	•	Because of the inherent properties of narrative communication, their creators have a special responsibility to ensure even-handedness in selection and presentation of the scientific evidence. The recent transformation in communication and information technology has brought about new platforms for delivering content, particularly through interactivity, which can use structured self-tailoring to help individuals most efficiently get exactly the content that they need. (Downs, 2014)
	•	Use of narrative in science communication can help to over- come these problems by addressing limitations of both the communicator and the audience. Communicators using narrative are forced to consider a context in which the concepts will pro- vide some elucidation, and to make explicit how the new concept expands knowledge by identifying its importance in a narrative voice. The audience then gains a new framework for organizing their knowledge, or reinforces an existing one when they already have a reasonable understanding. (Downs, 2014)
	•	There are numerous benefits of using narrative to communi- cate new information, drawing strength from the fundamental nature of how narrative information is processed (2, 4, 6, 7). A well-designed narrative can be far more appealing than just facts and can capture attention more easily, in part because it can allow the viewer to better process and understand information (2, 16). (Downs, 2014)
	•	When better understanding of science creates a basis for context-specific behavior change, then the narrative can also help to lay the groundwork for remembering to engage in the preferred behavior when the time arises. Many behaviors require real-time decision making, such as choosing a healthy meal, turning down an offered cigarette, or insisting on a condom. Although plans may be made in advance, they are of little use if situational cues overwhelm good general intentions. Narratives can harness com- mon situational cues by incorporating them into the context of the story, turning them into signals inherent in the conflict needing resolution. Thus, the narrative itself can trigger awareness of rele- vant cues, creating memory traces that will be more strongly evoked in the situations where the scientific message is most relevant. (Downs, 2014)
	•	a narrative communication may include alternative stories that are structurally parallel but superficially different in ways that create interest, providing an opportunity for multiple exposures to critical material without making it feel redundant. (Downs, 2014)
Nation
Powerful nation
	•	Powerful nations are not immune to calamity either because their leaders may misperceive threats or miscalculate responses. (Betts, 2007)
NATO
	•	NATO has become the pivotal institution in constructing a new European security architecture. Most importantly, perhaps, the construction of the new security architecture has to a considerable extent been achieved by constructing a new reflexive conception of security. NATO has not only reinvented itself; it has provided a Western forum for reinventing security. (Rasmussen, 2001)
	•	NATO defines itself by the constructive character by which it has set a new security agenda. (Rasmussen, 2001)
	•	NATO has been used as the forum for establishing a Western consensus on the security issues of the post-Cold War world. (Rasmussen, 2001)
	•	The Cold War focused NATO in one direction and made the Alliance focus exclusively on the resources need to defeat the Red Army. (Rasmussen, 2001)
	•	By making itself the institutional centre of European security, NATO has sought to manage the transformation of the Cold War system. It has used the enlargement of its own institutional sphere to define the rules of the new European security system in ways the Alliance believes will guarantee peace. (Rasmussen, 2001)
	•	Central to NATO’s conception of the conditions for security agency in the post- Cold War world is the notion that there exists ‘an environment of continuing change’.  (Rasmussen, 2001)
	•	
Near misses 
	•	The problem is that near misses are often overlooked—or, perversely, viewed as a sign that systems are resilient and working well. (Tinsley et al., 2011)
	•	Recognizing and learning from near misses isn’t simply a matter of paying attention; it actually runs contrary to human nature (Tinsley et al., 2011)
	•	Because near misses can look like successes, they often escape scrutiny. (Tinsley et al., 2011)
	•	typically, design flaws that had gone undetected (Tinsley et al., 2011)
	•	Seeing and attending to near misses requires organizational alert- ness, but no amount of attention will avert failure if people aren’t motivated to expose near misses—or, worse, are discouraged from doing so. In many organizations, employees have reason to keep quiet about failures, and in that type of environment they’re likely to keep suspicions about near misses to themselves (Tinsley et al., 2011)
	•	A near miss often causes hostile reaction, particularly if an appropriate authority must be informed of and incident which had the potential to cause major harm (Wells, 1996)
Negation
	•	ings which are present in a certain object are realized in the next stage. Negation, accordingly, "does not mean simply saying No, or declaring a thing to be non-existent, or destroying it in any way one may choose ... Each kind of thing ... has its own peculiar man- ner of becoming negated, and in such a way that a development results from it, and the same holds good for each type of ideas and conceptions ... This must be learned like everything else." (Feyerabend, 1993)
Negociations
	•	My advice to students when I taught negotiations was that if you think the other side has made an outrageous proposal, you should not come back with an equally outrageous counteroffer, creating a gap that will be difficult to bridge in further negotiations. Instead you should make a scene, storm out or threaten to do so, and make it clear—to yourself as well as to the other side—that you will not continue the negotiation with that number on the table. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	In general, a strategy of deliberately “thinking the opposite” may be a good defense against anchoring effects, because it negates the biased recruitment of thoughts that produces these effects. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	Negotiations, whether unassisted or involving a mediator, can typically be thought o f as moving through three distinct phases: pre-negotiation, integrative negotiation, and implementation. Each involve activities intended to promote the development o f consensual agreements which are sustainable. (Baughman, 1995)
	•	Political constraints to negotiations can also impede initial face- to-face discussions between the parties. (Baughman, 1995)
Negotiators
	•	Negotiators often pretend intense attachment to some good (perhaps missiles of a particular type in bargaining over arms reductions), although they actually view that good as a bargaining chip and intend ultimately to give it away in an exchange. Because negotiators are influenced by a norm of reciprocity, a concession that is presented as painful calls for an equally painful (and perhaps equally inauthentic) concession from the other side. (Kahneman, 2012)
Pre-negotiation
	•	At the initiation of any mediation effort there must be a dispute between two or more parties. (Baughman, 1995)
	•	A final element of the pre-negotiation phase deserving consideration here is joint fact-fmding. In joint fact-finding, parties agree to obtain a common body of information upon which discussions over implications can draw. Joint fact-fmding seeks to avoid the problems of advocacy science, which often serve to frustrate rather than facilitate consensus. Rather than a "my expert versus your expert setting," joint fact-finding has all parties to the dispute agree to the selection and scope of inquiry of a common pool of expertise. (Baughman, 1995)
	•	As the pre-negotiation phase closes, a mediator should be in place; all appropriate parties to the negotiation should be involved and a spokesperson identified; each stakeholder group should have determined that they belong in and are committed to initiating the negotiation process; protocols and an agenda to govern the process should have been consensually developed; and joint fact-finding initiatives should have been undertaken as necessary. (Baughman, 1995)
Integrative Negotiations
	•	In a mediated dispute, the mediator will typically work independently with stakeholders to develop "packaged trades" as proposed solutions. (Baughman, 1995)
	•	The basis of such trades will be found in solution options derived through group brainstorming processes. The mediator will seek to identify differences in the values parties place upon different characteristics of the issue in dispute. If both parties are willing to trade in areas they each assess differently, prospects for each party to emerge from the negotiations with a sense ofhaving gained are very good. (Baughman, 1995)
Neoinstitutionalism
	•	Neoinstitutionalism is predicated on the concept of organizational legitimacy. An organization is granted legitimacy if stakeholders believe an organization is good and/or has a right to continue operations (Allen & Caillouet. 1994: Bedeian, 1989). (Coombs and Holladay, 1996)
	•	From the neoinstitutional perspective, organizations should favor the use of crisis response strategies that reflect efforts to re-establish legitimacy. (Coombs and Holladay, 1996)
	•	"Neoinstitutional research consistently indicates corporate actors use mechanisms and procedures to convey conformity with their institutional environment to enhance legitimacy and survival chances" (Allen & Caillouet. 1994, p. 48). (Coombs and Holladay, 1996)
	•	Neoinstitutionalism and attribution theory suggest three means by which crisis strategies might affect an organizational image: 1. Convince stakeholders there is no crisis.
2. Have stakeholders see the crisis as less negative.
3. Have stakeholders see the organization more positively. (Coombs and Holladay, 1996)
	•	

Net assessment
	•	Reliable net assessments are needed to complete an effective estimative process, so that policymakers can better appreciate Soviet strengths and weaknesses by having systematically compared them with those of the United States--,a function which the ME's are not designed to perform. (CIA, 1978)
Network
	•	The real benefits of the network are to be found in its capacity for distributed computing. (Coker, 2009)
	•	Networks, in particular, have become an important tool for studying complexity. (Holland, 2014)
	•	Looked at from the network point of view, survival depends on routings that provide better use of resources – for example, recirculation of water and bio-carbon in an ecosystem, or an improved multiplier effect for cas flow in an economy. Inside a network community, it is these routings that are favoured. As a consequence, the tags that determine these routings become persistent features of the community. Persistent tags, in turn, become building blocks for further changes, and, consequently, a source o new hierarchical organizations. In this process, thr throughput from lower level niches largely determines the nature of interactions between higher level niches – persistent lowe niches with higher throughput have more influence on the overall organization. (Holland, 2014)
	•	Networks are present in the everyday life of many people. On a typical day, we check emails, update social network profiles, make mobile phone calls, use public transportation, take planes, transfer money and goods, or start new personal and professional relations…In all these cases—consciously or not—we are using networks and their properties.
	•	networks appear in important global phenomena. Financial crises generate domino effects in the web of connections between banks and companies. Pandemics—like avian flu, SARS, or swine flu—spread in the airport network. Climate change can alter the network of relations between species in ecosystems. Terrorism and war target the infrastructure grids of a country. Large-scale blackouts take place in power grids. Computer viruses diffuse in the Internet. Governments and companies can track people’s identity through their social networks and other digital communication tools. Finally, the various applications of genetics depend on the knowledge of the genetic regulatory networks that operate within the cell. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
	•	In all these situations we deal with a large set of different elements (individuals, companies, airports, species, power stations, computers, genes …), connected through a disordered pattern of many different interactions: that is, they all have an underlying network structure. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
	•	Focusing on the network structure allows us to see that faraway elements end up being strongly connected, through incredibly short paths of relation or communication. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
	•	In the study of complex, emergent, and self-organized systems (the modern science of complexity), networks are becoming increasingly important as a universal mathematical framework, especially when massive amounts of data are involved. This is typically the case of individuals accumulating queries in search engines, updates in social websites, payments online, credit card data, financial transactions, GPS positions from mobile phones, etc. In all these situations networks are crucial instruments to sort out and organize these data, connecting individuals, products, news, etc. to each other. Similarly, molecular biology relies more and more on computational strategies to find order in the large amounts of data it produces. The same happens in many other fields of science, technology, health, environment, and society. In all of these, networks are becoming the paradigm to uncover the hidden architecture of complexity. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
	•	networks try to explain how a set of isolated elements are transformed, through a pattern of interactions, into groups and communities. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
	•	a basic feature of the network approach: in networks, topology is more important than metrics. That is, what is connected to what is more important than how far apart two things are: in the other words, the physical geography is less important than the ‘netography’ of the graph. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
	•	The focus on topology is one of its biggest strengths of the network approach, useful whenever topology is more relevant than metrics. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
	•	Networks provide a bridge between the paradigms of a brain divided into specialized areas versus the model of the brain as a whole (not dissimilar to what happens in social sciences, where networks allow us to describe society at a level between individuals and communities). (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
	•	In all networks, almost all the elements of the systems take part in one large connected structure, called a giant connected component. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
	•	This result implies that networks display a very special kind of economy, intrinsic to their disordered structure: a small number of edges, even randomly distributed between nodes, is enough to generate a large structure that absorbs almost all the elements. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
	•	The small-world property consists of the fact that the average distance between any two nodes (measured as the shortest path that connects them) is very small. Given a node in a network (say, Paul Erdős in the co-authorship network), few nodes are very close to it (direct co-authors) and few are far from it (scientists with very high Erdős numbers): the majority are at the average—and very short—distance. This holds for all networks: starting from one specific node, almost all the nodes are at very few steps from it; the number of nodes within a certain distance increases exponentially fast with the distance. Another way of explaining the same phenomenon (the way scientists usually spell it out) is the following: even if we add many nodes to a network, the average distance will not increase much; one has to increase the size of a network by several orders of magnitude to notice that the paths to new nodes are (just a little) longer. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
	•	The small-world property is something intrinsic to networks. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
	•	In word ntworks, polysemy is one main source of shortcuts. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
	•	The presence of these hubs is not specific to the stockbroker’s social network, or to the airport network. Many other systems, when represented as graphs, show similar highly connected vertices, or superconnectors. In many networks, one can see a ‘winner takes all’ tendency: a few nodes attract the majority of connections, and the large remainder of nodes have to share the remaining links. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
	•	in words’ networks, the hubs are the ambiguous or polysemic words: such as ‘arms’, which in English refers both to bodily extremities and weapons, and he quantity of triangles and thus connects to a larger semantic or synonym field. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
	•	Hubs are also present in the networks inside the cell. In the genetic regulatory network, a single gene can control the expression of a large portion of the rest of the genome: in one bacterium (the Caulobacter crescentus), one single regulatory factor (the CtrA) controls 26 per cent of the cell cycle-regulated genes. The p53 molecule is a superconnector of the protein interaction network: the gene associated to this protein is a powerful tumor suppressor, and it is mutated in a large range of tumors. A clear hub of the metabolic network is the Atp molecule (adenosine triphosphate): this plays the role of energy carrier for a large number of biochemical reactions. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
	•	“Even networks seeming to be completely static are subject in fact to some kind of dynamic process. The networks of genes, proteins, and metabolites in the cell, those of neurons in the brain, and those of species in the ecosystem, seem to be fixed in time: genetic regulation, metabolic pathways, neuron connections, or prey–predator relations are relatively stable. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
	•	Preferential attachment is not the only mechanism at work in networks, and not all heterogeneous networks come from this mechanism. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
	•	Domino effects are not uncommon in foodwebs. Networks in general provide the backdrop for large-scale, sudden, and surprising dynamics. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
	•	Network nodes can represent individual entities (people, computers, species, genes…) exchanging material or information (information packets, energy, etc.), or they can represent locations (countries, airports…) exchanging individual entities (goods, travellers…). Within this very broad classification, the range of possible dynamics is enormous. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
	•	The network seems to tolerate a certain amount of chronic dysfunction without too many problems. It relies somehow on alternatives paths, allowing traffic to get around failure. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
	•	Networks are very different from engineered systems. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
	•	It is true that networks can be interesting also if they are not heterogeneous, but it is fair to say that often interesting networks are indeed heterogeneous. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
Communication network
	•	The communication network influences the dynamics of traffic, but this in turn reshapes the network, in a feedback loop. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
Collaboration network
	•	In the network of collaboration between scientists, a large cooperation structure appears, omitting only a few lonely players. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
Ego network
	•	The network with the Medici at the centre is an example of an ego network, a graph composed of a set of nodes with direct ties to a central one (the ego), as well as ties linking them to each other. Whenever one of the latter ties is missing (i.e. two neighbours of the ego are not neighbours to each other) the network has a structural hole. Cosimo’s network was full of structural holes, and his family was able to use them to implement a divide et impera (divide and reign) strategy: the Medici were seen as a third party in many conflicts, and families had to ask their mediation in their relations with other families. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
Genetic network
	•	The genetic regulatory network is divided into subnetworks, associated to specific functions or diseases. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
Internetworking
	•	Internetworking became the motto of many computer scientists. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
Network approach
	•	The network approach focuses all the attention on the global structure of the interactions within a system. The detailed properties of each element on its own are simply ignored. Consequently, systems as different as a computer network, an ecosystem, or a social group are all described by the same tool: a graph, that is, a bare architecture of nodes bounded by connections. This approach was originally developed in mathematics by Leonard Euler and later spread to a wide range of disciplines, including sociology, which has deployed it widely, and more recently physics, engineering, computer science, biology, and many others. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
	•	The network approach also sheds light on another important feature: the fact that certain systems that grow without external control are still capable of spontaneously developing an internal order. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
	•	While the network approach eliminates many of the individual features of the phenomenon considered, it still maintains some of its specific features. Namely, it does not alter the size of the system—i.e. the number of its elements—or the pattern of interaction—i.e. the specific set of connections between elements. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
	•	The network approach tries to complement these two points of view. Many phenomena are impossible to explain if one focuses only on the behaviour of individual elements. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
	•	The network approach is somewhere between the description by individual elements and the description by big groups, bridging the two of them. In a certain sense, networks try to explain how a set of isolated elements are transformed, through a pattern of interactions, into groups and communities. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
	•	a basic feature of the network approach: in networks, topology is more important than metrics. That is, what is connected to what is more important than how far apart two things are: in the other words, the physical geography is less important than the ‘netography’ of the graph. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
	•	The focus on topology is one of its biggest strengths of the network approach, useful whenever topology is more relevant than metrics. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
	•	The network approach reduces complex systems to a bare architecture of nodes and links. This is a substantial simplification, but still the resulting graph may not be so easy to interpret. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
	•	The focus on topology is one of the strengths of the network approach, but it forgets many of the specific features of the elements. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
	•	Timing is important in a large range of networks: for example, scientific publications are arrayed in time, and they can only cite papers that came out in the past. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
Network clustering
	•	In all these cases, it doesn’t matter how many friends you have (your degree), or who they are (for example, whether their degree is similar to or different from yours). What really matters is who your friends’ friends are; in particular whether or not your friends are also friends to each other. This concept is often referred to as transitivity, or clustering. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
	•	Another interesting point about clustering is that in almost all networks, the clustering of a node depends on the degree of that node. Often, the larger the degree, the smaller the clustering coefficient. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
Network dysfunction 
	•	The network seems to tolerate a certain amount of chronic dysfunction without too many problems. It relies somehow on alternatives paths, allowing traffic to get around failure. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
Network graph
	•	Mathematicians call the dots and lines forming it (respectively) vertices and edges. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
	•	In most real-world networks, there may be elements with many connections (and indeed, there are), but in general the graphs are not dense: on the contrary, they are said to be sparse. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
Degree distribution
	•	The outcome of this procedure provides the distribution of the connectivity of the nodes of the social network, that is, the degree distribution of the graph. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
	•	Mathematically speaking, the shape of the degree distribution is well described by a curve called power law. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
	•	The power law implies that there are many more hubs (and much more connected) in heterogeneous networks than in homogeneous ones. Moreover, hubs are not isolated exceptions: there is a full hierarchy of nodes, each of them being a hub compared with the less connected ones. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
	•	Looking at the degree distribution is the best way to check if a network is heterogeneous or not: if the distribution is fat tailed, then the network will have hubs and heterogeneity. A mathematically perfect power law is never found, because this would imply the existence of hubs with an infinite number of connections. However, no real network is infinitely big: this is why the fat tail of the degree distribution always has a cut-off at a maximum value for the degree. Indeed, the size of hubs can be limited by various costs of accumulating connections: for example, neurons cannot accumulate an arbitrary amount of connections, because of their physical and now represents a wide variety of topics in history, philosophy, religion, science, and the humanities. The VSI ve of the structure. In professional collaboration networks, time plays a role: connections cannot be accumulated indefinitely, because at a certain moment the career (or life) of an individual comes to an end. All these and other factors are reflected in the shape of the degree distribution. Nonetheless, a strongly skewed, fat-tailed distribution is a clear signal of heterogeneity, even if it is never a perfect power law. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
Network growth
	•	This realization is due to physicists Albert-László Barabási and Réka Albert. Barabási and Albert put forward a mathematical model of the growth of a network. They imagined a graph that starts with a small set of vertices (even just two or three), connected at random. New nodes are added at a steady rate to this initial nucleus, each of them carrying a given number of links. A simple rule establishes how new nodes are linked: incoming vertices prefer old ones that already have many links. This mechanism is called preferential attachment. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
Network model
	•	Cells or ecosystems are not ‘designed’ but nevertheless work in a robust way. Similarly, social groups and trends arise from an immense variety of different pressures and motivations but still display clear and definite shapes. The Internet and the WWW boomed without the presence of any regulating authority and were promoted by an enormous variety of unrelated agents: however, they usually work in a coherent and efficient way. All these are self-organized processes, i.e. phenomena in which order and organization are not the result of an external intervention or global blueprint but the outcome of local mechanisms or tendencies, iterated along thousands of interactions. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
	•	Network models are able to describe in a clear and natural way how self-organization arises in many systems. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
Network science
	•	The basic approach of network science can be applied to a broad set of systems. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
	•	Network science should avoid the trap of overhyping. Its holistic vision, the revelation of unexpected similarities between widely different systems, and the current cultural fascination with the concept of network bring with them the temptation to think of network science as a ‘theory of everything’. Sociologists, engineers, biologists, and philosophers have warned about the bald generalizations drawn from network theory. Most of this criticism is reasonable, but the results of network science should not be underestimated, nor its potential for future discoveries impaired. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
	•	The first major limitation of network science is the hunger for large-scale data. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
	•	Another criticism points to the fact that network science has found nothing more than fuzzy similarities between different systems and dynamics, but not real universality classes. These are groups of different phenomena that correspond to the same basic mathematical laws (once certain details are discounted). (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
	•	Network science has shown predictive power in several fields. IT is currently being used in consulting, to help organizations to better exploit the skills distributed across its members; in public health, to predict and prevent the spread of infectious diseases; in police and the military, to track terrorist, criminal, or rebel networks; and in several other fields. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
	•	There are many problems to be tackled: among them, making more detailed models to fit specific networks and dynamics; finding new relevant network data; digging deeper in topology to find unnoticed regulatrities and fully explain the existing ones; characterizing small networks and learning how to deal with networks of networkds; connecting biological networks more effectively with the evolutionary paradigm; finding new applciations (for example in drug design); and possibly finding universality classes. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
Network theory 
	•	Network theory, more formally known as graph theory, was put on a firm basis by Denes Konig in the early 20th century, though the use of particular networks, such as inheritance trees, goes beyond Darwin to early times. (Holland, 2014)
Network transitivity
	•	In all these cases, it doesn’t matter how many friends you have (your degree), or who they are (for example, whether their degree is similar to or different from yours). What really matters is who your friends’ friends are; in particular whether or not your friends are also friends to each other. This concept is often referred to as transitivity, or clustering. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
Neuronal network
	•	The neuronal network is divided into big areas, often corresponding to specific functions. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
Real world network
	•	In most real-world networks, there may be elements with many connections (and indeed, there are), but in general the graphs are not dense: on the contrary, they are said to be sparse. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
	•	All real-world networks display some level of modularity. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
	•	As with the Internet and the WWW, most of the real-world networks show a double-edged kind of robustness. They are able to function normally even when a large fraction of the network is damaged, but suddenly certain small failures, or targeted attacks, bring them down completely. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
Sexual interaction networks 
	•	In sexual interaction networks, past and current intercourse can connect us with individuals we would never imagine or desire to be related to. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
Social network
	•	In social networks, the relevance of topology means that social structure matters. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
	•	a large part of social network research is devoted to working out how different kinds of ties affect each other. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
	•	Superconnectors are present in many kinds of network, not only in social ones. Some routers in the Internet have thousands of connections: that is, thousands more than the average router, which has just a few links. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
	•	With respect to social networks, politics, money, religion, language, and culture influence the relations between individuals, but when spaces of freedom are available, the shaping of these networks is not strictly planned. In all these cases, the overall organization of the systems emerges from the collective action of its elements, a bottom-up process of self-organization. This process may explain why many networks, even without being blueprinted, still display a remarkable signature of order like heterogeneity. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
	•	while social networks tend to be assortative. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
	•	Social networks are divided into cliques: for example, studies with adolescents have showed that their behaviours are strongly influenced by the modules to which they belong. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
Technological network
	•	most natural and technological networks tend to be disassortative. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
Weight network
	•	Predation is counted in the number of prey eaten, web pages can be connected by a sporadic link or by a large number of connections, and love can range from slight attraction to furious passion. Such further features correspond to the weights we can add to the links. Weighted networks may arise, for example, as a result of different frequencies of interaction between individuals or entities. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
New-institutionalism
	•	new-institutionalism examines organizational environments as a resource for uncertainty management by supplying the scripts, routines, ideas and forms of management knowledge which formal organizations adopt to deal with a particularly significant aspect of uncertainty, namely legitimacy (Powell and Dimaggio, 1992) (Power, 2009)
	•	Neoinstitutionalism and attribution theory can be merged to form a symbolic approach to crisis management. (Coombs and Holladay, 1996)
New production of knowledge
	•	New Production of Knowledge claims that the decline of science’s normative cultural authority has resulted in an urgent need for science to gain credibility. The way to achieve this is to create arenas for the critical discussion of science, where people- mostly well-educated ones – can participate. (Boholm, 2011)
	•	[…] because of the complexity of the reality with which science is dealing, there is a need to re-think science, to create a science that is richly contextualised, socially robust, and epistemologically eclectic. (Boholm, 2011)
	•	[…] the New Production of Knowledge argues forcefully for a democratisation of science to be achieved through discussion and contestation, the agora seems to be an exclusive place, both interms of actors and arguments. (Boholm, 2011)
New Public Management
	•	New Public Management philosophies, has routinized the forensic examination of decisionmaking processes and outcomes and, in so doing, amplified the salience of failure (Hood et al. 1999) (Rothstein and alt., 2013:218)

New World Order
	•	In the course of the twentieth century governments went much further in offering their citizens ‘freedom from fear’ and ‘freedom from want’, both of which were the cornerstone of Roosevelt’s vision of a New World Order that would be forged on the anvil of war. (Coker, 2009)
News 
	•	variations in the amount of news about the crisis remain dependent on the news-gathering routines of journalists, and thus on indicators of financial performance (H1) and public relations efforts (H2) (Kleinnijenhuis et al., 2015)
	•	changes in the amount of news will be preceded by changes in trade volume (Scheufele et al., 2011) and in PR efforts (Kiousis et al. 2007). (Kleinnijenhuis et al., 2015)
	•	News is any overt act which juts out of the routine of circumstance.… A good public relations man advises his client … to carry out an overt act … interrupting the continuity of life in some way to bring about a response. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	the suppression of news applies equally to the suppression of individual desire. Neither will suppress. With the normal person, the result of this social suppression is to produce an individual who conforms with sufficient closeness to the standards of his group to enable him to remain comfortably within it. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	The basis of the selection was clearly the general standard of the clientele of each individual appear. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
Bad news
	•	The brains of humans and other animals contain a mechanism that is designed to give priority to bad news. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	Kleinnijenhuis, Schultz, Oegema, & Van Atteveldt (2013) found that in the financial crisis of 2007 to 2009, negative news exacerbated the fall in the share prices of banks. Negative news during the recent financial crisis affected not only market volatility, but also the co- movement of national stock markets (Casarin & Squazzoni, 2013). (Kleinnijenhuis et al., 2015)
Big news
	•	All papers features big news. When there is no big news, real editing is needed to select the real news form the semi-news. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
Latest news
	•	In isolation, a poll or stock price do not tell us much about these strengths and weaknesses. They give us the deceptive impression that what is revealed in the present will only become more pronounced with time. It is normal to want to keep up with the latest news, but to base any kind of decision on these snapshots of the moment is to run the risk of misreading the larger picture. (Greene, 2018)
News channels
	•	An almost trivial assumption is that news channels will report on major organizational crises in a negative way. (Kleinnijenhuis et al., 2015)
	•	news about risky industries is largely positive, as long as economic performance is satisfactory, because, among other things, the time available to professional financial journalists in the cost-saving media industry decreased, while corporate investments in public relations increased (Tambini, 2010). (Kleinnijenhuis et al., 2015)
Non-sensational news
	•	It is from the non-sensational news that you see the world and assess, rightly or wrongly, the true value of persons and events. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
Semi-news
	•	“When real estate news breaks, semi-news must go. When real news is scarce, semi-news returns to the front page. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
Niche
	•	This formation of boundaries that mediate interactions between agents leads directly to the notion of ‘niche’. Niche is a widely used term, as in ‘market niche’ or ‘ecological niche’, but it is difficult to define. (Holland, 2014)
	•	The term ‘niche’ is widely used to describe an important part of the hierarchical organization of complex adaptive systems: local use of signals and resources. (Holland, 2014)
	•	Though the niche concept is a concept like ‘complexity’ that resists a sharp definition, the basic idea is that you have a diverse array of agents (organisms, market participants, industries … ) that depend upon each other through an exchange of resources and signals. (Holland, 2014)
	•	At this point, connections have been made between three different ways of presenting a niche: •    Networks provide a precise snapshot of the interactions of agents in a complex system at a given point in time •    The communities in these networks define existing niches within the complex system •    For each community there is a corresponding set of gated urns, and recombination of the tag-sensitive gate conditions provides a precise approach to co-evolutionary succession within the complex system. (Holland, 2014)
Node
	•	Old nodes have a cumulative advantage over new ones. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
	•	Network nodes can represent individual entities (people, computers, species, genes…) exchanging material or information (information packets, energy, etc.), or they can represent locations (countries, airports…) exchanging individual entities (goods, travellers…). Within this very broad classification, the range of possible dynamics is enormous. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
Central node
	•	Central nodes usually act as bridges or bottlenecks: they are almost compulsory stops in the traffic on a network. For this reason, centrality is an estimate of the load handled by a node of a network, assuming that most of the traffic passes through the shortest paths (this is not always the case, but it is a good approximation). For the same reason, damaging central nodes (for example, extinguishing a central species or destroying a central router) can impair radically the flow of a network. Depending on the process one wants to study, other definitions of centrality can be introduced. For example, closeness centrality computes the distance of a node to all others, and reach centrality factors in the portion of all nodes that can be reached in one step, two steps, three steps, and so on. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
Highly connected nodes 
	•	Highly connected nodes seem to play a crucial role, in both errors and attacks. They are the ‘Achilles heel’ of most heterogeneous networks exposed to targeted attacks. In these networks, hubs are mainly responsible for the overall cohesion of the graph, and removing a few of them is enough to destroy it. On the other hand, hubs are also the ‘ace in the hole’ of these networks, when they are exposed to errors and failures: when nodes are removed at random, most of the time the selected nodes come out from the large population with low degree, so as long as hubs are kept untouched, the network stays together. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
Node fitness
	•	“Newcomers often have some intrinsic feature that makes them much more attractive than older players. In this case, the connectivity of a network is not exclusively driven by the degree of the nodes, as in the Barabási–Albert model. On the contrary, a particular character of each node can play a very important role in its ability to gain links. This character is referred to as the fitness of the node, or as its hidden variable, a feature that shapes the structure of the network without being as evident as the number of links. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
	•	Like preferential attachment, it is unlikely that the fitness mechanism is at work in all real-world networks. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
Noise 
	•	consists of signs that point in the wrong direction and obscure the signals that point in the right way. (Honig, 2007)
	•	Scientists often say that any uncertainty in an observation is due to noise, without really defining exactly what the noise is, other than that which obscures our vision of whatever we are trying to measure, be it the length of a table, the number of rabbits in a garden, or the midday temperature. Noise gives rise to observational uncertainty, chaos helps us to understand how small uncertainties can become large uncertainties, once we have a model for the noise. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
	•	observational uncertainties are said to be caused by noise. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
	•	What is the difference between X and S? The unsung hero of science: noise. Noise is the glue that bonds the experimentalists with the theorists on those occasions when they meet. Noise is also the grease that allows theories to slide easily over awkward facts. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
	•	the noise is defined by the distance between X and S, and it makes sense to speak of noise as causing our uncertainty in the state, since we know a True state exists even if we do not know its value. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
	•	The physicists, earth scientists, economists, and other scientists do not know the rule, the full Laws of Nature, relevant to the physical systems of scientific study. And scientific observations are not perfect; they may be invariably uncertain due to observational noise. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
Dynamic noise
	•	random influences that do influence X are called dynamic noise. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
Noise model
	•	Of course a real physicist would never say that the length of the table was 1.370; she would say something like the length was 1.370 ± 0.005, with the aim of quantifying her uncertainty due to noise. Implicit in this is a model of the noise. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
Noise reduction
	•	if our model is perfect, then we can use future observations to learn about the past; this process is called noise reduction.  (Smith and Smith, 2007)
	•	Decreasing the noise increases her ability to determine what is more likely to happen. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
Observational noise
	•	The physicists, earth scientists, economists, and other scientists do not know the rule, the full Laws of Nature, relevant to the physical systems of scientific study. And scientific observations are not perfect; they may be invariably uncertain due to observational noise. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
	•	There is even disagreement as to how to estimate the current state of a system given from noisy observations, which threatens to stop us from making a forecast before we even get started. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
Signal-to-noise ratio
	•	Wohlstetter’s view—that an excess of noise had drowned out the pertinent intelligence signals and warnings—has since become conventional wisdom, and most major studies of surprise attack and intelligence failure employ the con- cepts of signals and noise to at least partly explain why intelligence so often fails and surprise attacks succeed. (Dahl, 2013)
In the words of the intelligence expert Bruce Berkowitz, ‘‘This problem of signal-to-noise ratio is so fundamental in the intelligence business that today, if one refers to the ‘Roberta Wohlstetter problem,’ almost everyone knows exactly what you are talking about.’ (Dahl, 2013)
Non-consequential thinking
	•	Nonconsequential thinking is a veritable plague in the world today that is only growing worse with the speed and ease of access to information, which gives people the illusion that they are informed and have thought deeply about things. (Greene, 2018)
Non linearity
	•	Nonlinearity is defined by what it is not (it is not linear).  (Smith and Smith, 2007)
	•	the world is not linear. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
	•	Like any cultural invasion, the arrival of nonlinear deterministic models with sensitive dependence was sometimes embraced, and sometimes not. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
	•	In mathematical terms, the interactions of interest are non-linear. (Holland, 2014)
Non linear dynamic
	•	One thing that distinguishes nonlinear dynamics from traditional analysis is that the former tends to focus more on the behaviour of systems rather than on the details of any one initial state under particular equations with specific parameter values. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
Non linear system
	•	a nonlinear system will show a disproportionate response. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
	•	Nonlinear systems need not, giving nonlinearity a critical role in the origin of sensitive dependence. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
	•	In practice there is an art of ‘tuning’ parameter values. And while nonlinearity requires us to reconsider how we find ‘good parameter values’, chaos will force us to re-evaluate what we mean by ‘good’. A very small difference in the value of a parameter which has an unnoticeable impact on the quality of a short-term forecast can alter the shape of an attractor beyond recognition. Systems in which this happens are called structurally unstable. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
Not In My Back Yard
	•	The NIMBY (Not In My Back Yard!) label refers to fervent local citizen opposition to siting proposals or land-use activities with potential adverse impacts (Rosa 1988). (Webler and Renn, 1995)
Nous
	•	What consumed Pericles as a thinker and a public figure was how to get out of this trap, how to be truly rational in an arena dominated by emotions. The solution he came up with is unique in history and devastatingly powerful in its results. It should serve as our ideal. In his conception, the human mind has to worship something, has to have its attention directed to something it values above all else. For most people, it is their ego; for some it is their family, their clan, their god, or their nation. For Pericles it would be nous, the ancient Greek word for “mind” or “intelligence.” Nous is a force that permeates the universe, creating meaning and order. The human mind is naturally attracted to this order; this is the source of our intelligence. For Pericles, the nous that he worshipped was embodied in the figure of the goddess Athena. (Greene, 2018)
Normal accident theory
	•	normal accident also moves the discussion from the level of general theories about organizations and environmental uncertainty to the specific characteristics of organizational vulnerability and response (Power, 2009)
	•	the essence of the normal accident: the interaction of multiple failures that are not in a direct operational sequence (Perrow, 1999)
	•	We will encounter this man's dilemma a few more times in this book; it goes to the core of a common organizational problem (Perrow, 1999) 
	•	Of such complexities is the normal accident made (Perrow, 1999)
	•	Nothing is perfect; every part of every system, industrial or not, is liable to failure. (Perrow, 1999)
	•	In our accident is our salvation (Perrow, 1999)
	•	“normal accident theory,” presents a much more pessimistic prediction: serious accident with complex high technology systems are inevitable. (Sagan, 1995)
	•	[…] high reliability theory and normal accident theory lead to very different predictions about the causes and the likelihood of serious nuclear weapons and command and control accidents. (Sagan, 1995)
	•	[…] although such complex organizations may work hard to maintain safety and reliability, serious accidents are nonetheless a “normal” result or an integral characteristic of the system. (Sagan, 1995)
	•	Serious accidents in organizations managing hazardous technologies may be rare, but they are inevitable over time. (Sagan, 1995)
	•	The belief that intelligent design and management will result in complex organizations that are capable of safely operating hazardous technology is an illusion according to this perspective. (Sagan, 1995)
	•	As long as we assume that organizations have goals and those goals have some classical properties of stability, precision and consistency, we can treat an organization as some kind of rational actor. But organizations do not have simple, consistent preference functions. They exhibit internal conflict over preferences. Once such conflict is noted, it is natural to shift from a metaphor of problem solving to a more political vision (March 1981) (Sagan, 1995)
	•	By not treating organization as rational, problem-solving actors, the theory has illuminated the hidden and more capricious aspects of organizational life. (Sagan, 1995)
	•	Normal accidents theorists do not disagree that it can be beneficial to have political elites and organization leaders place higher priority on the objective of safety and reliability (Sagan, 1995)
	•	Even If political elites and organizational leaders have consistent objectives favoring safety, they may be misinformed about the nature of frequency of dangerous operations by lower-level operators, whose interests include keeping their hobs and therefore not getting caught when rules are violated. (Sagan, 1995)
	•	[…] although the normal accidents theory accepts that there can be “organizations with an avowed goal of safe operations,” it treats the step from avowed goals to real organization objectives as very problematic”. (Sagan, 1995)
	•	Inconsistent goals and conflicting interest remain and can increase the risks of accident in important ways. (Sagan, 1995)
	•	The normal accident perspective, in contrast, focuses attention on the potential negative consequences of redundancy and, indeed, maintains that adding redundant part to a complex technological system a can increase the likelihood of accidents […] (Sagan, 1995)
	•	A normal accident perspective, however, in accordance with garbage can model assumptions, would lead to doubts about whether organization leaders know enough about their operations and technology to determine how lover-level authorities should respond in all contingencies. (Sagan, 1995)
	•	Analysts with a normal accidents perspective might agree in principle, but would also point out that an organization simply cannot develop operational experiences with relations to all the unanticipated and undesirable failure modes produced by high interactive complexity in hazardous technologies. (Sagan, 1995)
	•	Normal accidents theorists take a natural open systems perspective in which organizations and members of organizations are self-interested actors with potentially conflicting interests, and in which organizations are strongly influenced by broader political and social forces in the environment. (Sagan, 1995)
	•	The theory predicts that serious accidents are inevitable if the organizations that control hazardous technologies display both high interactive complexity (which produces bizarre and unanticipated failures) and tight coupling (which causes the failures out escalate rapid out of control). (Sagan, 1995)
	•	[…] the continuing desires to maximize production, maintain autonomy, and protect personal reputations, however, can severely impair efforts to improve safety. (Sagan, 1995)
	•	Indeed, from a normal accidents perspective, the fact that there has never been an accidental nuclear weapons detonation or an accidental war is surprising. (Sagan, 1995)
	•	NAT, on the other hand, does recognize the difficulties involved but is unnecessarily pessimistic about the possibility of effectively dealing with them. (Marais et al., 2004)
	•	Charles Perrow’s initial formulation of what has come to be known as Normal Accident Theory (NAT) was developed in the aftermath of the accident at the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant in 1979 (Marais et al., 2004)
	•	some technological systems, accidents are inevitable or “normal”. He defined two related dimensions— interactive complexity and loose/tight coupling—which he claimed together determine a system’s susceptibility to accidents. (Marais et al., 2004)
	•	According to the theory, systems with interactive complexity and tight coupling will experience accidents that cannot be foreseen or prevented. Perrow called these system accidents. When the system is interactively complex, independent failure events can interact in ways that cannot be predicted by the designers and operators of the system. If the system is also tightly coupled, the cascading of effects can quickly spiral out of control before operators are able to understand the situation and perform appropriate corrective actions. In such systems, apparently trivial incidents can cascade in unpredictable ways and with possibly severe consequences. (Marais et al., 2004)
	•	[…] accidents are inevitable in these systems and therefore systems for which accidents would have extremely serious consequences should not be built is overly pessimistic. (Marais et al., 2004)
	•	The argument advanced is essentially that the efforts to improve safety in interactively complex, tightly coupled systems all involve increasing complexity and therefore only render accidents more likely. (Marais et al., 2004)
	•	the only engineering solution he considers to improve safety is redundancy (Marais et al., 2004)
	•	While it is usually not possible to predict all accident scenarios in complex systems, thorough engineering analyses of system hazards can be used to prevent whole classes of potential accidents (Marais et al., 2004)
	•	Perrow himself provides a clue as to how to design safer systems in his identification of the two important factors in system accidents, i.e., reduce the interactive complexity and tight coupling in our designs. (Marais et al., 2004)
	•	Normal Accidents and HROs, both limit the progress that can be made toward achieving highly safe systems by too narrowly defining the problem and the potential solutions. (Marais et al., 2004)
	•	Following Perrow,19 the causes of failure might be:• Human error (Alice forgetting the cycle repair kit, not telephoning Bob in JTAC to warn him)• IT/mechanical problems (Alice’s PC was down for an hour)• The environment (an industrial dispute affecting the buses, and hav-ing an unexpected VIP in JTAC)• Design of the system (the timing of the weekly meeting, not havingsomeone else to see all material first thing when Alice was late) • Procedures used (weekly meetings, unnecessary priority flagging of some emails, where we might note that these procedures are actuallysafety systems introduced into offices to make communication fail-ures less likely)• All of these or none of these (Omand, 2014)

Normalization of deviance
	•	By 'normalized,' I mean the remarkable fact that individual perceptions and concerns notwithstanding, in all official engineering analyses and launch recommendations prior to the eve of the Challenger launch, Morton Thiokol and NASA engineers analyzed evidence that the design was not performing as predicted and reinterpreted it as acceptable and non-deviant. ... [A]s missions continued, ... working engineers gradually expanded the boundaries of acceptable risk. ... The critical decision was the first one, when, expecting no damage to the O-ring, in-flight damage occurred and they found it acceptable. (Vaughan, 1997, p. 85; emphases in original) (Gummer, 1998)
	•	Gradually, in their formal engineering risk assessments, the work group accepted more and more risk. Each of these decisions, taken singly, seemed correct, routine, and, indeed, insignificant and unremarkable, but they had a cumulative directionality, stunning in retrospect. ... Starbuck and Milliken called it an example of 'fine-tuning the odds until something breaks.' (Vaughan, 1997, p. 88) (Gummer, 1998)
	•	Because of the innovating, uncertain character of the technology, they were working in an organization culture where having problems was expected and taken for granted. (Gummer, 1998)
	•	Taking this uncertainty and risk into account before missions began, in 1981 NASA created a document titled 'The Acceptable Risk Process,' in which the agency acknowledged that after they had done everything that could be done, the shuttle would still contain residual risks. ... This cultural context contributed to the normalization of deviance because having problems was unremarkable and routine. ... What, in retrospect, appeared to be clear signals of potential danger that should have halted shuttle flights were interpreted differently at the time by the engineers responsible for risk assessments. (Vaughan, 1997,p. 86) (Gummer, 1998)
	•	After the disaster, the Presidential Commission and other post-tragedy analysts unanimously concluded that policy decisions had been a contributing cause of the tragedy. Political bargains and goal-setting by agency elites had altered the organization culture so that production concerns dominated the space agency. These policy decisions resulted in a three- faceted culture comprised of the space agency's original technical culture, bureaucratic accountability, and political accountability. The standards of engineering excellence that were behind the splendid successes of the Apollo era made up NASA's original technical culture. ‘Integral to that culture was the reliance on and deference to in-house professional technical expertise and experiential knowledge of the technology, known as the 'dirty hands' approach. Also, the original technical culture … required that risk assessments be guided by extensive testing, engineering principles, and rigorous quantitative analysis.’ (Vaughan, 1997,p. 88) (Gummer, 1998)
	•	The original technical culture required that rigorous, scientific, quantitative engineering arguments back up all engineering recommendations. As long as the managers and engineers ... had convincing quantitative data affirming risk acceptability (which they did), they could not interrupt the schedule to do tests necessary to understand why it was operating as it was. Policy decisions and impression management at the top eroded the ability of engineers to live up to some of the precepts of the original technical culture. Once the shuttle was declared operational, engineers could not request money for addition- al developmental testing unless analysis showed a component was an unacceptable risk. (Vaughan, 1997, p. 90; emphasis in original) (Gummer, 1998)
	•	Vaughan [4–6] has developed the concept of ‘‘normalization of deviance’’ to explain how technical flaws can escape the scrutiny of the various safety bodies within NASA5 over time. In many cases, unanticipated problems continue to occur even though nothing particularly catastrophic happens during a given Shuttle mission. This leads to the very pragmatic notion of ‘‘acceptable’’ deviance. (Hall, 2003)
	•	‘‘normalization of deviance’’ where an unpredicted anomaly becomes routine. (Hall, 2003)
	•	“deviance” is virtually never performed with criminal or malicious intent. (Banja, 2010)
	•	[…]phenomena of socialization, institutionalization, and rationalization enable corrupt practices to evolve in white collar organizations (Ashforth & Anand, 2003) (Banja, 2010)
	•	normalization of deviance begins with leadership’s requiring system operators to consistently renew their commitment to patient safety (Vaughan et al., 2005) (Banja, 2010)
	•	System operators must become acutely vigilant about deviant behaviors and practices, and be ready to take aggressive steps to halt their occurrence before they achieve normalization (Gerstein, 2008) (Banja, 2010)
	•	“normalization of deviance,” which is a degradation of professional, behavioral, and technical standards that increases the probability of a major accident or harm. (Knox and Simpson, 2011)
	•	Normalization of deviance (“slide to failure”) must be understood as unavoidable unless cumulative evidence and professional standards are actively used instead of individual experience, care processes are continuously monitored, and importantly, an absence of poor outcomes is not used as a indication that care is universally safe. (Knox and Simpson, 2011)
	•	This incremental process is a gradual erosion of normal procedures that would never be tolerated if proposed in 1 single, abrupt leap. Instead, small incremental deviations are observed and tolerated. Lacking an accident, they become “normalized.” (Prielipp et al., 2010)
	•	Normalization of deviance breaks the safety culture, substituting a slippery slope of tolerating more and more errors and accepting more and more risk, always in the interest of efficiency and on-time schedules. This toxic thinking often ends with a mindset that demands evidence that these errors would destroy the vehicle (or harm a patient), instead of demanding proof that the shuttle (or patient) is safe and not being harmed. The boundaries are soon pushed to extremes without understanding where and why the original limits were established. (Prielipp et al., 2010)
	•	“normalization of deviance,” the tendency over time to accept anomalies—particularly risky ones—as normal. Think of the growing comfort a worker might feel with using a ladder with a broken rung; the more times he climbs the dangerous ladder without incident, the safer he feels it is. For an organization, such normalization can be catastrophic. (Tinsley et al., 2011)
	•	normalization of deviance and outcome bias, along with other factors, conspired to obscure the grave implications of the near misses. (Tinsley et al., 2011)
	•	The normalization of signals of danger created the tragedy of the Challenger. (Simmons et al., 2011)
	•	normalization of deviance affects project management practices in the areas of 1) project proposals and strategic misrepresentation, 2) client/contractor relationships, and 3) planning and scheduling dynamics. (Pinto, 2014)
	•	The term "normalization of deviance" was first coined by Diane Vaughan, a sociologist' who studied the Challenger disaster and found a series of missteps, flawed assumptions, and a culture of risk-taking. (Pinto, 2014)
	•	"Social normalization of deviance means that people within the organization become so much accustomed to a deviant behavior that they don't consider it as deviant, despite the fact that they far exceed their own rules for the elementary safety's (from Villeret interview with Vaughan, 2008). (Pinto, 2014)
	•	normalization of deviance is the role that the “gradualism” phenomenon plays in promoting these concerns. (Pinto, 2014)
	•	acclimatization to "deviance" behavior occurs as a process of steps, sometimes over an extended -period. The unacceptable behavior does not occur all at once, but rather, may serve as the summation of multiple decisions made or avoided, with no visible or discernible negative effects. Thus, the potential for catastrophe is never envisioned as an option until it occurs. In a project setting, we see gradualism occur in scope adjustment, safety standards modification, or; incremental changes to plans and other control documentation (Eden et al., 2005; Winch, 2013) and often experience the effects that gradualism plays in ballooning project costs and schedules (Pinto, 2014)
	•	Normalization of deviance, on the other hand, is a mindset that the organization's actors adopt as cultural norms during the project development cycle. This behavior anticipates errors but more critically, it seeks to reduce perceptions of these errors to normal operating procedure. When "the unexpected" fully migrates to "the accepted," the danger for organizations is that they have rationalized away destructive behaviors or created an environment where deviance is permitted to thrive. (Pinto, 2014)
	•	normalized deviance differs from the more commonplace nature of organizational accidents due to engineering overreach (Petroski, 1992) or other design or development failures. Errors, particularly due to unexpected risk factors (e.g., "unknown-unknowns") will continue to remain a part of organizational life despite firms' attempts to identify and therefore minimize their effects as much as possible, leading to the "normal accidents" which are the price paid for the failure to jointly design technology and organization (Perrow, 1999). Further, some risks are accepted as a process of rational cost-benefit analysis, as has been argued to have occurred with NASA's decision to launch Challenger in the face of technical concerns. (Pinto, 2014)
	•	normalization of deviance, individuals, teams, and organizations repeatedly drift away from what are acceptable standards of practice until the drift has become the norm. (Pinto, 2014)
	•	normalization of deviance does not only occur as the result of deliberate efforts to deceive or violate norms, but also as a result of corporate cultures that promote counter-productive behaviors, seemingly with the best intentions. (Pinto, 2014)
	•	The normalization of deviance is a critical issue facing organizations, none more so than those engaged in project-based work (Pinto, 2014)
	•	normalization of deviance affects project-based work are not presupposed to be an exhaustive list. (Pinto, 2014)
	•	The end result of the gradualism of normalization of deviance, left unidentified and unchecked, is to make the process of managing projects increasingly difficult and will result in dysfunctional outcomes, ultimately diminishing a project organization's ability to perform either efficiently or effectively. (Pinto, 2014)
	•	Perrow and Guillen's is more political-organizational. (Clarke, 1999)
Normative debate
	•	The idea of the normative debate is very close to Bruce Acker- man’s notion that liberalism is based on a constrained dialogue (Douglas, 2005:135)
	•	normative debate is a fumbling, half-coherent process (Douglas, 2005:136)
	•	normative debate has to paper over the cracks in the logic so that a sufficiently strong consensus can emerge to protect the market from subversion (Douglas, 2005:141)
Norms
	•	We have norms for a vast number of categories, and these norms provide the background for the immediate detection of anomalies such as pregnant men and tattooed aristocrats. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	The norms specify a typical or average size for these animals, and they also contain information about the range or variability within the category. (Kahneman, 2012)
Social norms
	•	Conforming to social norms, you will listen more to others than to your own voice. (Greene, 2014)
	•	La transgression des normes ne provoque pas seulement une réaction collective de répression. C’est ainsi que G. Devereux (1970, p. 119) a pu écrire : « Pour sa part, la société accorde une reconnaissance explicite à tout déviant, même le plus extrême, et cela de manière parfois fort étonnante. Roheim et moi, nous avons tous deux eu l’occasion d’observer, dans deux sociétés primitives différentes, la condamnation avec admiration du mâle incestueux (...). Le prestige romantique du déviant reflète dans une certaine mesure l’acceptation imparfaite de la norme, même de la part des individus les mieux adaptés, et leur identification avec le ‘héros’, le grand criminel et l’excentrique qui osent la défier. » (Mannoni, 1985)

	•	Cette ambivalence apparaît nettement dans les termes qu’utilise, par exemple, la presse à grand tirage pour parler de ces individus. Les journalistes, faisant appel à une mythologie de bazar et mélangeant les genres, désignent les Carlos et Mesrine comme des êtres hybrides, mi-chevaliers mi-démons, mi-Robin des Bois, mi-Fantômas. Ce qui n’empêche pas la foule de trouver réconfortant le spectacle de leur exécution. (Mannoni, 1985)
Notional normality
	•	‘notional normality’ whereby working practices are sustained by sufficiently accurate individual and organizational beliefs about the world that can accommodate accumulating problems up to the point that those beliefs are challenged by a major disaster or crisis (Turner and Pidgeon 1997: pp. 71ff). (Rothstein, 2003)
	•	Notionally normal starting points (a) Initial culturally accept beliefs about the world and its hazards. (b) associated precautionary norms set out in laws, codes of practices, more and folkways. (Turner and Pidgeon, 1997)
	•	The notionally normal stage refers in this case to the beliefs held about the hazards of mining and the precautionary procedures needed to deal with them in the area of the Cambrian Colliery, Glamorgan, up to 7 May 1965. In the words of the official report: Everyone concerned at the colliery regarded the Pentre Seam and the P26 face in particular as virtually gas-free. 'The management were no doubt fortified in this belief by the fact that the statutory mine samples never showed more than 0.38 per cent firedamp ..:26 The pit was thus one in which there was virtually no firedamp, a belief confirmed by regular checks, and therefore a pit in which there was little need for anxiety about ventilation and procedures associated (Turner and Pidgeon, 1997)
	•	In fact, we may consider all events, not merely accidental or unexpected ones, as having both an energy and an information component. People move towards their goals by directing energy in an orderly fashion, guided by appropriate information, in order that their desired outcome is produced. Disasters, accidents and all forms of unintended consequences may be considered as the results of energy which at some point was combined with misleading or inadequate information from the point of view of the individuals or the organization concerned. Although we talk about 'creating' energy, we never create it in any real sense, for we merely take potential energy which is locked up in one form or another, whether as food or as fuel, and redirect it for our own purposes. (Turner and Pidgeon, 1997)
	•	the construction of a phase model of events which includes the following six phases: a notionally normal starting point; an incubation period; terminated by a precipitating event; which leads to the onset of the disaster; rescue and salvage dealing with the immediate problems after the disaster; and a final stage of full cultural readjustment to the surprise associated with the precipitating event (Turner and Pidgeon, 1997)
	•	‘notionally normal' starting point for the development of disasters. From this starting point, for each disaster or large-scale accident which emerges, we have suggested that there is an 'incubation period', before the disaster, which begins when the first of the ambiguous or unnoticed events which will eventually accumulate to provoke the disaster occurs, moving the community away from the notionally normal starting point. Large-scale disasters rarely develop instantaneously, and the incubation period provides time for the resources of energy, materials and manpower which are to produce the disaster to be covertly and inadvertently assembled. (Turner and Pidgeon, 1997)
	•	Stage 1: Initial beliefs and norms. At this stage events are reasonably “normal.” Culturally held beliefs about hazards are sufficiently accurate to enable individuals and group to deal successfully with problems. The community adheres to normative prescriptions (embodied in laws and codes of practice, “common sense”, and folkways) which are consonant with accepted beliefs and which enable the community to cope with the world. When unfortunate consequences result from violation of these prescriptions there is no need for cultural readjustment, such incidents are labelled as accident, are not surprising, and the attribution of their cause to violation serves to strengthen the force of existing prescription. This stage is the notional starting point for disaster development. (Stech, 1979)
	•	On the basis of ‘incubation theory’, the starting point for serious disaster analysis must be the ‘notional normality’ embodied in routine patterns of activity which inhibit intelligent risk processing. From this point of view, crises and catastrophes do not just happen suddenly; they are in an important sense ‘organised’ and have their origins in failures of management and intelligence processes over a long period of time. Even apparently surprise or random acts (the terrorists attacks of 11 September 2001; the Turkish earthquake) are being traced to historical organisational and intelligence failures (fragmentation in security and police services; non-compliance with construction regulations). In the light of incubation theory, a risk management approach docused on organisation processes, such as enterprise risk management (ERM) and its variants, seems rational and functional. And yet, as suggested above, an intensified concern for organisational process may also incubate risks of its own, not least the failure to see, imagin or act upon the ‘bigger picture’. (Power, 2004)
	•	From a    bounded rationality perspective,    officials’ understandings  and  perceptions  of  risk  are  bounded  within  organisational  paradigms of  what  is  possible, legitimate  and  important  (e.g.  Hawkins  and  Thomas,  1989:  7; Manning, 1989: 61).24 Complementary work on groupthink (Janis, 1972) and notional normality (Turner  and  Pidgeon,  1997)  similarly invoke  models of organisational behaviour that filter out problems that threaten or undermine organisational practices at  the  expense  of  long-term problem-solving.  From such  standpoints,  rationales guiding   bureaucratic   perceptions   of   risk   and   behaviour   embody   institutional ‘irrationalities’  and,  as  such,  are  likely to  diverge  from often  posited,  but  rarely examined, ‘expert’ or ‘objective’ rationales. (Rothstein, 2003)

Noun phrases
	•	In Generative Grammar, noun phrases (NPs) are category labels that are of central importance. Many syntactic rules (or the modern equivalent of rules) employ this category label. 
	•	The Generative Grammar claim is that it has no meaning, nor do other labels of the same type, and so syntactic rules written with it are autonomous from semantics. (Tomasello, 1998)
	•	NP is a highly meaningful category. (Tomasello, 1998)
	•	An NP is an element in an utterance that is used in discourse to isolate and identify for the listener some "thing" where "thing" is simply a way of construing an aspect of experience, however abstract and intangible, as a bounded entity on analogy with a concrete object (Hopper & Thompson, 1984; Langacker, 1987b). (Tomasello, 1998)
Numeric extrapolation

O
Objective
	•	[…] ’objective’ in the sense that they should lend themselves neither to subjective interpretations by the researcher (in the sense that two investigators applying the same techniques should obtain the same results), not to the expressive subjectivity of the individual studied (in the sense that two people with similar states should give similar answers) (Corbetta, 2003)

Observable objects
	•	observable objects. The elements of internal control and risk management systems provide just this; they are necessary conditions for an ideal of reflexive governance with its language and categories of self-observation (Power, 2009)
Observation
Personnal observation
	•	Personal observations by intelligence analysts and agents can be as deceptive as secondhand accounts. Most individuals visiting foreign countries become familiar with only a small sample of people representing a narrow segment of the total society. Incomplete and distorted perceptions are a common result. (Heuer, 1999)
Observational skills
	•	in developing these observational skills you will notice a physical change in yourself and in your relation to people. You will become increasingly sensitive to people’s shifting moods and even anticipate them as you feel inside something of what they’re feeling. Taken far enough, such powers can make you seem almost psychic, as they did with Milton Erickson. (Greene, 2018)
Observational terms
	•	notice how theories ("operative character" of all mo- tion: essential correctness of sense reports), which are not formulated explicitly, enter the debate in the guise of observational terms. We realize again that observational terms are Trojan horses which must be watched very carefully. (Feyerabend, 1993)
	•	concepts that are hidden in observation statements are not likely to reveal themselves in the more abstract parts of language. (Feyerabend, 1993)
	•	the content of a concept is determined also by the way in which it is related to perception. (Feyerabend, 1993)
Oceanic feeling
	•	Entering a state of flow with our work or cultivating deeper levels of empathy with people (see chapter 2) will give us more such moments and satisfy the urge. We feel oneness with the work or with other people. We can take this even further by experiencing a deeper connection to life itself, what Sigmund Freud called “the oceanic feeling.” (Greene, 2018)
Odd
Language of odd
	•	There is a language for odds; in fact there are two--the precise mathematical language of the actuary or the race track bookie and a less precise though useful verbal equivalent. We did not use the numbers, however, and it appeared that we were misusing the words. (Kent, 1964)
Official
	•	officials cannot avoid generalizations, and generalizations are theoretical. (Betts, 2007)
	•	Officials’ theories are usually the generalizations they have derived from personal experience and from insti- tutional folklore and doctrine. (Betts, 2007)
Opening-up
	•	Opening-up needs to mean open-mindedness, it needs to mean asking new questions and it needs to mean listening to a much wider range of perspectives. (Stilgoe et al., 2006)
Open-ended evaluation procedure
	•	Open-ended evaluation procedures reduce the risk of underestimating people's understanding in cases where their frame of reference differs from that of the evaluator. They reduce the risk of overestimating people's knowledge in cases where people harbor misconceptions that the evaluators do not suspect. (Bostrom et al., 1994)
	•	They reduce the risk of overestimating people's knowledge in cases where people harbor misconceptions that the evaluators do not suspect. They can measure what "sticks" in readers' minds, as well as what information people are able to apply in solving problems. On the other hand, open-ended procedures are expensive to administer and their scoring has an obviously subjective element (which is hidden in structured procedures, where one does not see the variety of interpretations given to particular ques- tions and answers). (Bostrom et al., 1994)
Operation
Effects-based operations
	•	Effects-based operations is the name of a methodology in which the desired effect of any action, regardless of its scope, has to be identified first. (Coker, 2009)
Operation principles
	•	Today, it recognizes twelve principles of operation. Nine are the so-called traditional principles: objective, offensive, mass, economy of force, manoeuvre, unity of command, security, surprise and simplicity. Three others have been added which were originally developed for opera- tions other than war: restraint, perseverance and legitimacy. (Coker, 2009)
Operational
Operational readiness
	•	‘Operational readiness’ is the difference between the current and the full combat potential of existing military units. This difference is minimized by training and by stockpiling munitions, spare parts and supplies, and the maintenance of wartime manpower and materiel levels. (Frühling, 2014)
	•	Maintaining forces at high levels of operational readiness is therefore expensive, and difficult over extended periods. (Frühling, 2014)
	•	Reducing reaction time through maintaining highoperational readiness can reduce the severity of a possible strategic surprise. (Frühling, 2014)
	•	because operational readiness comes at significant cost, using warning time for mobilization can be a more efficient use of resources, which would result in larger forces being available overall. (Frühling, 2014)
Structural readiness
	•	‘structural readiness’, which refers to the degree to which the military potential inherent in its population and economy is translated into formed military units. These units can be manned by reservists but would require additional equipment and training to be brought into combat-ready state if required. (Frühling, 2014)

Mobilization readiness
	•	Over even longer timeframes, countries can choose to focus on ‘mobilization readiness’: the degree to which preparations have been made to transform the military potential of a nation into force structure. (Frühling, 2014)
	•	Mobilization readiness is based on military technology being available, and mobilization plans and industrial capacity being organized to manage the surge of inputs required for creatingmilitary forces. (Frühling, 2014)
	•	It can refer to timescales as short as weeks or even days, for surges of industrial production with existing machinery and tools, to many years if major unitsare to be formed, equipped and trained. (Frühling, 2014)
	•	Mobilization readiness or reserve forces are options, with industrialmobilization or call-up as the second stage investments. (Frühling, 2014)
Operational evaluation
	•	operational evaluation (particularly in protracted unconven- tional wars such as Vietnam and Iraq), there is the problem of overload from the high volume of finished analyses, battlefield statistics, reports, bulletins, reconnaissance, and communications intercepts flowing up- ward through multiple channels at a rate exceeding the capacity of of- ficials to absorb or scrutinize them judiciously. (Betts, 2007)

Operator
	•	operators will include not only those actually running the system (nuclear plant operators, pilots, ship officers) but others in attendance on regular shifts, such as first-level supervisors, maintenance personnel, low-level engineering personnel, and laborers and assisting personnel. (Perrow, 1999)
	•	operators worry most about utility. (Betts, 2007)

Opinion
	•	As Judge Learned Hand wrote, "Opinions are at best provisional hypotheses, incompletely tested. The more they are tested, after the tests are wellscrutinized, the more assurance we may assume, but they are never absolutes. So, we must be tolerant of opposite opinions or varying opinions by the very fact of our incredulity of our own." (Gates, 1992)
	•	Le mécanisme de la contagion est si puissant que, devant son action, l'intérêt personnel lui-même s'évanouit. Et c'est pourquoi toute opinion devenue populaire finit toujours par s'imposer avec une grande force aux couches sociales les plus élevées, quelque visible que puisse être l'absurdité de l'opinion triomphante. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Le propre du prestige est d'empêcher de voir les choses telles qu'elles sont et de paralyser tous nos jugements. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Les foules toujours, les individus le plus souvent, ont besoin, sur tous les sujets, d'opinions toutes faites. Le succès de ces opinions est indépendant de la part de vérité ou d'erreur qu'elles contiennent; il dépend uniquement de leur prestige. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	La disparition actuelle des croyances générales et la diffusion extrême de la presse rendent de nos jours les opinions de plus en plus mobiles. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Impuissance des gouvernements à diriger comme jadis l'opinion.—L'émiettement actuel des opinions empêche leur tyrannie. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	À côté des éléments psychologiques irréductibles d'une race se rencontrent des éléments mobiles et changeants. Et c'est pourquoi, en étudiant les croyances et les opinions d'un peuple, on constate toujours un fonds très fixe sur lequel se greffent des opinions aussi mobiles que le sable qui recouvre le rocher. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Les croyances et les opinions des foules forment donc deux classes bien distinctes. D'une part, les grandes croyances permanentes, qui durent plusieurs siècles, et sur lesquelles une civilisation entière repose, telles, par exemple, autrefois, la conception féodale, les idées chrétiennes, celles de la Réforme; tels de nos jours, le principe des nationalités, les idées démocratiques et sociales. D'autre part, les opinions momentanées et changeantes, dérivées le plus souvent des conceptions générales, que chaque âge voit naître et mourir: telles sont les théories qui guident les arts et la littérature à certains moments, celles, par exemple, qui ont produit le romantisme, le naturalisme, le mysticisme, etc. Elles sont aussi superficielles, le plus souvent, que la mode, et changent comme elle. Ce sont les petites vagues qui naissent et s'évanouissent sans cesse à la surface d'un lac aux eaux profondes. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Les grandes croyances générales sont en nombre fort restreint. Leur naissance et leur mort forment pour chaque race historique les points culminants de son histoire. Elles constituent la vraie charpente des civilisations. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Il est très facile d'établir une opinion passagère dans l'âme des foules, mais il est très difficile d'y établir une croyance durable. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Tous ceux contraires aux croyances générales et aux sentiments de la race n'ont qu'une durée éphémère, et le fleuve détourné reprend bientôt son cours. Les opinions qui ne se rattachent à aucune croyance générale, à aucun sentiment de la race, et qui, par conséquent, ne sauraient avoir de fixité, sont à la merci de tous les hasards ou, si l'on préfère, des moindres changements de milieu. Formées par suggestion et contagion, elles sont toujours momentanées; elles naissent et disparaissent parfois aussi rapidement que les dunes de sable formées par le vent au bord de la mer. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	l'impuissance des gouvernements à diriger l'opinion. Jadis, et ce jadis n'est pas fort loin, l'action des gouvernements, l'influence de quelques écrivains et d'un tout petit nombre de journaux constituaient les vrais régulateurs de l'opinion. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Épier l'opinion est devenu aujourd'hui la préoccupation essentielle de la presse et des gouvernements. Quel est l'effet produit par un événement, un projet législatif, un discours, voilà ce qu'il leur faut savoir sans cesse; et la chose n'est pas facile, car rien n'est plus mobile et plus changeant que la pensée des foules, et rien n'est plus fréquent que de les voir accueillir avec des anathèmes ce qu'elles avaient acclamé la veille. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Cette absence totale de direction de l'opinion, et en même temps la dissolution des croyances générales, ont eu pour résultat final un émiettement complet de toutes les convictions, et l'indifférence croissante des foules pour ce qui ne touche pas nettement leurs intérêts immédiats. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Aujourd'hui, devant la discussion et l'analyse, toutes les opinions perdent leur prestige; leurs angles s'usent vite, et il en survit bien peu qui nous puissent passionner. L'homme moderne est de plus en plus envahi par l'indifférence. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Les foules ont des opinions imposées, jamais des opinions raisonnées. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	The mental equipment of the average individual consists of a mass of judgments on most of the subjects which touch his daily physical or mental life. These judgments are the tools of his daily being and yet they are his judgments, not on a basis of research and logical deduction, but for the most part dogmatic expressions accepted on the authority of his parents, his teachers, his church, and of his social, his economic and other leaders. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	“If we examine the mental furniture of the average man,” says William Trotter, the author of a comprehensive study of the social psychology of the individual,1 “we shall find it made up of a vast number of judgments of a very precise kind upon subjects of very great variety, complexity, and difficulty. He will have fairly settled views upon the origin and nature of the universe, and upon what he will probably call its meaning; he will have conclusions as to what is to happen to him at death and after, as to what is and what should be the basis of conduct. He will know how the country should be governed, and why it is going to the dogs, why this piece of legislation is good and that bad. He will have strong views upon military and naval strategy, the principles of taxation, the use of alcohol and vaccination, the treatment of influenza, the prevention of hydrophobia, upon municipal trading, the teaching of Greek, upon what is permissible in art, satisfactory in literature, and hopeful in science. “The bulk of such opinions must necessarily be without rational basis, since many of them are concerned with problems admitted by the expert to be still unsolved, while as to the rest it is clear that the training and experience of no average man can qualify him to have any opinion upon them at all. The rational method adequately used would have told him that on the great majority of these questions there could be for him but one attitude—that of suspended judgment.” (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	No idea or opinion is an isolated factor. It is surrounded and influenced by precedent, authority, habit and all the other human motivations. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	It is therefore apparent that these and the other institutions which modify public opinion carry on against a background which is also in itself a controlling factor. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
Changing opinion
	•	les changements qui surviennent dans ces opinions sont parfois beaucoup plus superficiels que réels, et que toujours ils portent l'empreinte des qualités de la race. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Ce n'est pas le nom donné aux opinions, ni des adaptations trompeuses qui changent le fond des choses. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Tous ceux contraires aux croyances générales et aux sentiments de la race n'ont qu'une durée éphémère, et le fleuve détourné reprend bientôt son cours. Les opinions qui ne se rattachent à aucune croyance générale, à aucun sentiment de la race, et qui, par conséquent, ne sauraient avoir de fixité, sont à la merci de tous les hasards ou, si l'on préfère, des moindres changements de milieu. Formées par suggestion et contagion, elles sont toujours momentanées; elles naissent et disparaissent parfois aussi rapidement que les dunes de sable formées par le vent au bord de la mer. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	De nos jours, la somme des opinions mobiles des foules est plus grande qu'elle ne le fut jamais; et cela, pour trois raisons différentes: La première est que les anciennes croyances perdant de plus en plus leur empire, n'agissent plus comme jadis sur les opinions passagères pour leur donner une certaine orientation. L'effacement des croyances générales laisse place à une foule d'opinions particulières sans passé ni avenir. La seconde raison est que la puissance des foules devenant de plus en plus grande et ayant de moins en moins de contrepoids, la mobilité extrême d'idées que nous avons constatée chez elles, peut se manifester librement. La troisième raison enfin est la diffusion récente de la presse qui met sans cesse sous les yeux des foules les opinions les plus contraires. Les suggestions que chacune d'elles pourrait engendrer sont bientôt détruites par des suggestions opposées. Il en résulte que chaque opinion n'arrive pas à s'étendre et est vouée à une existence très éphémère. Elle est morte avant d'avoir pu se répandre assez pour devenir générale. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	l'impuissance des gouvernements à diriger l'opinion. Jadis, et ce jadis n'est pas fort loin, l'action des gouvernements, l'influence de quelques écrivains et d'un tout petit nombre de journaux constituaient les vrais régulateurs de l'opinion. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	L'opinion des foules tend donc à devenir de plus en plus le régulateur suprême de la politique. (Lebon, 1895)
Opinion manufacturing
	•	“the compliance professions,” those groups and often clandestine organizations that exist to manufacture public thought, opinion and behavior on behalf of political and corporate clients. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	The conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in democratic society. Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of our country. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	“Crystallization,” in the field of physical chemistry, describes the process by which an amorphous entity—a gas or suspension in fluid form—is transformed into a solid coherent mass. For Bernays, “crystallizing public opinion” was about taking an “ill-defined, mercurial and changeable group of individual judgments” and transforming them into a cohesive and manageable form. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	Bernays portrayed the public relations practitioner as an instrumental social scientist, a resolute student of human motivation. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	The public relations counsel, he argued, specialized in understanding the public mind and knowing how to create those circumstances that would gain public attention to consolidate public opinion. A pivotal aspect of the PR counsel’s “wide range of instruments and techniques,” as Bernays described them, was an intimate knowledge of those “mediums … through which public attention is reached and influenced.… the channels of thought and communication.” (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	“Crowds have always undergone the influence of illusions,” he wrote, “Whoever can supply them with illusions is easily their master. Whoever attempts to destroy their illusions is always their victim.” For Le Bon, to exert control over the social order in a democratic age a “small intellectual aristocracy,” adept in the application of mass psychology, was essential. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	Evoking a metaphor inspired by the recent invention of the phonograph, Tarde argued, “the conversations of individuals … are forced to follow the groove of their borrowed thoughts. One pen suffices to set off a million tongues.” (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	Of particular interest to Trotter, and to Bernays, was the “herd instinct,” the unceasing need to gain the approval and camaraderie of the social group. The individual Trotter wrote, is “more sensitive to the voice of the herd than to any other influence. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	Describing the peculiar aptitude of the public relations counsel, Bernays maintained “it is his capacity for crystallizing the obscure tendencies of the public mind before they have reached definite expression, which makes him so valuable.”  (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	Public Opinion declares that the “significant revolution of modern times is not industrial or economic or political, but the revolution which is taking place in the art of creating consent among the governed.” He goes on: “Within the life of the new generation now in control of affairs, persuasion has become a self-conscious art and a regular organ of popular government. None of us begins to understands the consequences, but it is no daring prophecy to say that the knowledge of how to create consent will alter every political premise. Under the impact of propaganda, not necessarily in the sinister meaning of the world alone, the only constants of our thinking have become variables. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	It has been demonstrated that we cannot rely upon intuition, conscience, or the accidents of casual opinion if we are to deal with the world beyond our reach.” (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	The best examples, of course, of the increasing importance of public opinion to industries which until recently scarcely concerned themselves with the existence or non-existence of a public opinion about them, are those industries which are charged with a public interest. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	First of all, there are the circumstances and events he helps to create. After that there are the instruments by which he broadcasts facts and ideas to the public; advertising, motion pictures, circular letters, booklets, handbills, speeches, meetings, parades, news articles, magazine articles and whatever other mediums there are through which public attention is reached and influenced. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	A great deal, I think myself, of the crucial part of what looks to the worker and the reformer as deliberate misrepresentation on the part of newspapers, is the direct outcome of a practical difficulty in uncovering the news, and the emotional difficulty of making distinct facts interesting unless, as Emerson says, we can ‘perceive’ (them) and can ‘set about translating (them) at once into parallel facts.’” (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	In view then of the possibility of a malleable public opinion the counsel on public relations, desiring to obtain a hearing for any given cause, simply utilizes existent channels to obtain expression for the point of view he represents. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	Because of the importance of channels of thought communication, it is vital for the public relations counsel to study carefully the relationship between public opinion and the organs that maintain it or that influence it to change. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	The public and the press, or for that matter, the public and any force that modifies pubic opinion, interact. Action and interaction are continually going on between the forces projected out to the public and the public itself. The public relations counsel must understand this fact in its broadest and most detailed implications. He must understand not only what these various forces are, but he must be able to evaluate their relative powers with fair accuracy. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	The influence of any force which attempts to modify public opinion depends upon the success with which it is able to enlist established points of view. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	The institutions which make public opinion conform to the demands of the public. The public responds to an equally large degree to these institutions. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	many splendid newspapers have accomplished as leaders in public movements. The New York Evening Post is another example, it having long led popular demand for vocational guidance and control. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	Powerful standards control the very institutions which are supposed to help form public opinion. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	In tracing the interaction of institution upon public and public upon institution, one finds a circle of obedience and leadership. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	It is therefore apparent that these and the other institutions which modify public opinion carry on against a background which is also in itself a controlling factor. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	It is as untrue to contend that public opinion is manufactured as it is to contend that public opinion governs the agencies which mould it. The public relations counsel must continually realize that there are always these limitations to his effectiveness. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	The public relations counsel is not needed to persuade people to standardize their points of view or to persist in their established beliefs. The established point of view becomes established by satisfying some real or assumed human need. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	The public relations counsel can come forward, first, as the representative of established things when their security is shaken, or when they desire greater power; and second, as the representative of the group which is struggling to establish itself. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	The training of the public relations counsel permits him to step out of his own group to look at a particular problem with the eyes of an impartial observer and to utilize his knowledge of the individual and the group mind to project his clients’ point of view. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	The difficulty of establishing and building new channels of approach to the public is shown best by an examination of the principal mediums which are available to the public relations counsel who desires to direct public thought to the problems of the group he represents. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	The cost of establishing a paper with a wide appeal, which will have the facilities of gathering news, of printing and distributing it, is such that groups can no longer depend upon their own organs of expression. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	People accept the facts which come to them through existing channels. They like to hear new things in accustomed ways. They have neither the time nor the inclination to search for facts that are not readily available to them. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
Ready to think
	•	Mais on ne saurait oublier qu’il existe également des modes affectives, sentimentales ou d’opinions. Ce que M. Poniatowski (1978) appelle le « prêt-à-penser ». (Mannoni, 1985)
Public opinion
	•	la nature de l’opinion publique reste très complexe ; car elle touche d’une part à un système de croyances fortement enracinées et cristallisées au niveau tant collectif qu’individuel ; d’autre part à des processus événementiels affectés d’une forte contingence. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	« l’opinion publique est, suivant l’expression d’Y. Castellan (op. cit., p. 217), le jugement social d’une communauté consciente sur les questions d’intérêt general. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Cet apparent aspect discursif ne doit cependant pas faire oublier qu’elle est fonction des déterminations socioculturelles, socio-économiques, de l’appartenance à un groupe. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Des facteurs divers et multiples interviennent pour l’influencer : famille, école, cercles et cénacles, mais surtout les mass media. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Ajoutons seulement que n’importe quoi peut alimenter n’importe quand. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Les mass media exercent, en outre, une influence sur l’opinion publique qui est tantôt fabriquée par eux de toutes pièces, tantôt profondément modifiée. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	La disparition actuelle des croyances générales et la diffusion extrême de la presse rendent de nos jours les opinions de plus en plus mobiles. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Impuissance des gouvernements à diriger comme jadis l'opinion.—L'émiettement actuel des opinions empêche leur tyrannie. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	“the compliance professions,” those groups and often clandestine organizations that exist to manufacture public thought, opinion and behavior on behalf of political and corporate clients. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	Public opinion has entered life at many points as a decisive factor. Men and movements whose interests will be affected by the attitude of the public are taking pains to have themselves represented in the court of public opinion by the most skillful counselors they can obtain. The business of the public relations counted is somewhat like the business of the attorney—to advise his client and to litigate his causes for him. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	Public opinion is a term describing an ill-defined, mercurial and changeable group of individual judgments. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	Public opinion is the aggregate result of individual opinions—now uniform, now conflicting—of the men and women who make up society or any group of society. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	In order to understand public opinion, one must go back to the individual who makes up the group. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	There is a divergence of opinion as to whether the public mind is malleable or stubborn—whether it is a passive or an active element. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	Uniformity is, in fact, largely natural and only partly artificial. Public opinion may be as much the producer of “insidious propaganda” as its product. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	where broad ideas are involved, criticisms of the state of the public’s mind and of its origin come most frequently from groups that are out of sympathy with the accepted point of view. They find the public unreceptive to their point of view, and justly or unjustly they attribute this to the influence of antagonistic interests upon the public mind. These groups see the press, the lecture platform, the schools, the advertisements, the churches, the radio, the motion picture screen, the magazines daily reaching millions. They see that the preponderant point of view in most, if not all, these institutions conforms to the preponderant state of mind of the public. They argue from the one to the other and reach their conclusions without much difficulty. They do not stop to think that agreement in point of view between the public and these institutions may often be the result of the control exercised by the public mind over these institutions. Many outside forces, however, do go to influence pubic opinion. The most obvious of these forces are parental influence, the school room, the press, motion pictures, advertising, magazines, lectures, the church, the radio. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	press stands preeminent among the various institutions which are commonly designated as leaders or molders of the public mind. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	the man who is outside the current of prevailing public opinion should regard the daily press as a coercive force. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	other influences beside the press enter into the making of a public opinion and that these forces must never be disregarded in the estimate of the quality and stability of a prevalent public opinion. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	the daily press and the other leading forces merely accept, reflect and intensify established public opinion and are, therefore, responsible for the uniformity of public reaction. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	Naturally the press, like other institutions which present facts or opinions, is restricted, often unconsciously, sometimes consciously, by various controlling conditions. Certain people talk of the censorship enacted by the prejudices and predispositions of the public itself. Some, such as Upton Sinclair, ascribe to the advertisers a conscious and powerful control of publications. Others, like Walter Lippmann, find that an effective barrier between the public and the event exists in the powerful influence which, he says, is exerted in certain cases on the press by the so-called quality public which the newspapers’ advertisers which to reach and among whom the newspapers must circulate if the advertising is to be successful. Mr. Lippmann observes that although such a restriction may exist, much of what may be attributed to censorship in the newspaper, often is actually inadequate presentation of the events it seeks to describe. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)

	•	The truth is that while it appears to be forming the public opinion on fundamental matters, the press is often conforming to it. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	Ralph Pulitzer nevertheless agrees with Mr. Mencken that the opinion of the press is set by the public; and he justifies “muckraking”2 by finding it neither “extraordinary nor culpable that people and press should be more interested in the polemical than in the platitudinous; in blame than in painting the lily; in attack than in sending laudatory coals to Newcastle.” (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	of the modern press on its less commendable side, we are bound to admit that newspapers, like governments, fairly reflect the people they serve. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	“The editor does not nonchalantly project his thoughts into the void. He listens for the echo of his words. His reaction to his supporters is not unlike Gladstone’s definition of the intimate connection between the orator and his audience. As the speaker gets from his hearers in mist what he gives back in shower, so the newspaper receives from the public as well as it gives back to it. Too often it gets as dust what it gives back as mud; but that does not alter the relations. Action and reaction are all the while going on between the press and its patrons. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	What they want and what they get are fused by some mysterious alchemy. The press, the lecturer, the screen and the public lead and are led by each other. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)

	•	The standards of fitness created in the minds of the publishers express the point of view of a mass of readers, and this enables the newspapers to achieve and maintain circulation and financial success. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	In the press there is a very human tendency to compromise between giving the public what it wants and giving the public what it should want. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	It is therefore apparent that these and the other institutions which modify public opinion carry on against a background which is also in itself a controlling factor. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	It is as untrue to contend that public opinion is manufactured as it is to contend that public opinion governs the agencies which mould it. The public relations counsel must continually realize that there are always these limitations to his effectiveness. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	The difficulty of establishing and building new channels of approach to the public is shown best by an examination of the principal mediums which are available to the public relations counsel who desires to direct public thought to the problems of the group he represents. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	The public relations counsel works with public opinion. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	Public opinion is the product of individual minds. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	Individual minds make up the group mind. And the established order of things is maintained by the inertia of the group. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	Changed conditions can make possible modifications in the public point of view. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
Self opinion
	•	We humans like to believe that we are consistent and mature, and that we have reasonable control over our lives. We make decisions based on rational considerations, on what will benefit us the most. We have free will. We know who we are, more or less. But in one particular aspect of life these self-opinions are all easily shattered—when we fall in love. (Greene, 2018)
Optimism 
Optimists
	•	Optimists believe that the decisions they make are more prudent than they really are, and loss-averse decision makers correctly reject marginal propositions that they might otherwise accept. (Kahneman, 2012)
Exaggerated optimism
	•	Exaggerated optimism protects individuals and organizations from the paralyzing effects of loss aversion; (Kahneman, 2012)
Optimistic bias
	•	Optimistic biases also appear for positive events: people regard themselves as more likely than others to experience financial success, career advancement, and long life(6). Pessimistic biases (8) are rare. (Weinstein, 1989)
	•	Optimism may also arise when ambiguous risk factors are inter-preted in a biased manner. (Weinstein, 1989)
	•	Optimism is greatest for hazards with which subjects have little personal experience, for hazards rated lowin probability, and for hazards judged to be controllable by personal action. (Weinstein, 1989)
	•	Optimism is also strong ifpeople think that signs of vulnerability appear early (as they think is true of diabetes, alcoholism, and asthma), so that an absence of present signs means they are exempt from future risk. (Weinstein, 1989)
	•	One idea is that optimistic biases represent attempts to shield ourselves from the fear of being harmed. (Weinstein, 1989)
	•	Optimistic biases are produced by simple cognitive errors. (Weinstein, 1989)
	•	Cognitive errors do not provide an adequate explanation for optimistic biases because they do not explain why pessimistic biases almost never appear.
	•	The notion that optimistic predictions are actively constructed, rather than arising from simple mentalerors, is supported by instances where reasoningis distorted to yield self-serving predictions. (Weinstein, 1989)
	•	Optimistic biases in personal risk perceptions are important because they may seriously hinder efforts to promote risk-reducing behaviors. (Weinstein, 1989)
	•	Optimism about personal risks is associated with less depression. (Weinstein, 1989)
	•	Optimism about successful performance leads people to try harder on difficult tasks, so that they realy do succeed more often. (Weinstein, 1989)
	•	A general tendency to be optimistic may even have positive consequences for physical health. (Weinstein, 1989)
	•	People believe that negative events are less likely to happen to them than to others, and they believe that positive events are more likely to happen to them than to others. (Weinstein, 1980)
	•	optimistic biases were generally regarded as evidence of defensiveness or wishful thinking. (Weinstein, 1980)
	•	Presumably, the stronger the affect, the stronger the distortion of reality. (Weinstein, 1980)
	•	Among negative events, the more undesirable the event, the stronger the tendency to believe that one's own chances are less than average; among positive events, the more desirable the event, the stronger the tendency to believe that one's own chances are greater than average. (Weinstein, 1980)
	•	If people focus only on their own circumstances, they may conclude incorrectly that their chances differ from those of other people. (Weinstein, 1980)
	•	The greater the perceived probability of an event, the stronger the tendency for people to believe that their own chances are greater than average. (Weinstein, 1980)
	•	Previous personal experience with an event increases the likelihood that people will believe their own chances are greater than average. (Weinstein, 1980)
	•	To explain why people would say that their chances are greater than average for positive events but less than average for negative events by using these hypotheses would require that positive events always be associated with high probability or high personal experience and that negative events always be associated with low probability or low personal experience. (Weinstein, 1980)
	•	If an event is perceived to be controllable, it signifies that people believe there are steps one can take to increase the likelihood of a desirable outcome. Because they can more easily bring to mind their own actions than the actions of others, people are likely to conclude that desired outcomes are more likely to happen to them than to other people. (Weinstein, 1980)
	•	The preceding argument assumes that people generally bring to mind actions that facilitate rather than impede goal achievement. (Weinstein, 1980)
	•	The greater the perceived controllability of a negative event, the greater the tendency for people to believe that their own chances are less than average; the greater the perceived controllability of a positive event, the greater the tendency for people to believe that their own chances are greater than average. (Weinstein, 1980)
	•	For many events—contracting lung cancer and becoming an alcoholic, for example—people may have a stereotyped conception of the kind of person to whom this event happens. If they do not see themselves as fitting the stereotype, the repre- sentativeness heuristic suggests that people will conclude that the event will not happen to them, overlooking the possibility that few of the people who experience the event may actually fit the stereotype. (Weinstein, 1980)
	•	If stereotypes of the victim tend to serve an ego-defensive function, people would seldom see themselves as representing the type of person who falls prey to misfortune. Furthermore, if stereotypes are defensive, an indi- vidual's image of the people who experience positive events would overemphasize his or her own characteristics. These tendencies would exaggerate optimistic biases for any event associated with a stereotype. (Weinstein, 1980)
	•	eople may be struck by the superficial differences between themselves and the stereotype (differences such as sex, age, or appearance) and fail to see more fundamental similarities between themselves and the people to whom the event occurs. This would lead people to conclude that the event will not happen to them, producing optimism for negative events but pessimism for positive events. (Weinstein, 1980)
	•	optimistic biases arise because people tend not tothink carefully about their own and others'circumstances or because. (Weinstein, 1980)
	•	The optimistic bias refers to people’s tendency to think their risk is less than that of their peers. (Klein and Helweg-Larsen, 2002)
	•	The optimistic bias refers to people’s tendency to think their risk is less than that of their peers. It is a remarkably resilient phenomenon that researchers have investigated exten- sively (Weinstein and Klein, 1996). (Klein and Helweg-Larsen, 2002)
	•	People believe that they are less at risk than their peers for many negative events, such as getting cancer, becoming alcoholics, getting divorced, or getting injured in a car accident (Weinstein, 1980). The optimistic bias exists for both men and women and across age and educational levels (Weinstein, 1987). (Klein and Helweg-Larsen, 2002)
	•	The optimistic bias can be assessed either directly or indirectly (Weinstein and Klein, 1996). When the optimistic bias is assessed directly, an individual makes a single comparative risk estimate of his or her likelihood of experiencing a future event relative to a target’s likelihood of that same event. The target is usually ‘‘an average other’’ of similar age and gender. When the optimistic bias is assessed indirectly, the individual makes two estimates, one estimate of his or her own likelihood and a separate estimate of a target’s likelihood of an event occurring in the future. (Klein and Helweg-Larsen, 2002)

Unrealistic optimism
	•	According to popular belief, people tend to think they are invulnerable. They expect others to be victims of misfortune, not them-selves. Such ideas imply not merely a hopeful outlook on life, but an error in judgment that can be labeled unrealistic optimism. (Weinstein, 1980)
	•	people may be unrealistically optimistic because they lack certain information needed to make accurate risk assessments or use procedures to judge future probabilities that introduce systematic errors. (Weinstein, 1980)
Option (defense planning)
	•	The term ‘option’ is usually used in the defence planning literature to refer to a candidate solution under consideration. (Frühling, 2014)
	•	it too has a precise original meaning in the financial context, where options are standardized financial contracts that give the buyer the right to sell or to buy an underlying asset at an agreed price in the future. (Frühling, 2014)
	•	Options allow to split an investment into two stages: first for the purchase of the option itself, and a discretionary second stage if the option is exercised. The value of an option derives from the fact that new information becomes available between these two stages, which the buyer of the option can use to make a second decision in the future. (Frühling, 2014)
	•	‘real options’: they too are investments that do not generate profits immediately, but provide the opportunity to invest again, once more information isavailable. (Frühling, 2014)
	•	Many investments in the defence context are also realoptions. (Frühling, 2014)
Opportunity
	•	In general use, opportunity is defined as “a favourable juncture of circumstances” (Merriam-Webster’s Dictionary), “a chance to do something or an occasion when it is easy for you to do something” (Longman), “a chance to do something, or a situation in which it is easy for you to do something” (Macmillan), “a time or set of circumstances that makes it possible to do something” (Oxford), or “an occasion or situation which makes it possible to do something that you want to do or have to do, or the possibility of doing something” (Cambridge). (Newsome, 2013)
	•	FrameNet defines opportunity as “a situation not completely under the afent’s control and usually of a limited duration” that gives the agent “a choice of whether or not to participate in some desirable event.”. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	In general sense, an opportunity is a positive situation or good fortune (an antonym of threatening situation). (Newsome, 2013)
	•	[…] some authorities define an opportunity as both a positive risk and the source (akin to a positive hazard) of a positive risk. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Opportunity is sometimes used as the source of a positive risk, but we should not want to lose the unique meaning of opportunity as a faborable situation. (Newsome, 2013)
Opportunists
	•	Opportunists, on the other hand, have no particular speciality. They depend instead on their skill to sniff out any kind of opportunity in the environment an seize upon it. They are in states of constant tension and require continual stimulation. (Greene, 2014)
Order
	•	An ‘order’ suggests that it can be enforced (pacification) or policed, or secured against external and internal threats. 
	•	“Ordre et désordre ne se séparents pas”, souligne G. Balandier (1988, p. 12). Même lorsqu’il n’y paraît pas, dans les sociétés traditionnelles notamment qui sont des sociétés d’ordre, le désordre poursuit son “travail cache” et, à tout moment, “le désordre peut se traduite en ordre par l’effet de l’imaginaire, du symbolique et des pratiques ritualiséees. Le pouvoir lui-même y apparaît comme une machine qui a la capacité de traiter le désordre et de le convertir en énergie poisitive” (ibid.). (Mannoni, 1985)
Ordinal ranking
	•	The respondent’s task can be made easier by asking the respondent to rank the risk on an ordinal scale, rather than to assess the risk abstractly. (Newsome, 2013)
Organisation
	•	an organization is a set of procedures for argumentation and interpretations as well as for solving problems and making decisions (March and Olsen, 1976)
	•	Organizations, rather than individuals, are the critical agents of any so-called risk society because it is primarily ‘in these contexts that hazards and their attendant risks are conceptualized, measured and managed’ (Short 1992: 4). Organizations are both centres for processing and handling risks and potential producers and exporters of risk. (Hutter and Power, 2005) 
	•	organizations must exhibit conformity to rational risk management principles (Power, 2009)
	•	Organizations are seen as “natural” in that they (as is natural with all social groups) actively pursue goals of narrow self-interest, such as their own security and survival, and not just their official goals, such as profit, production, or reliability. (Sagan, 1995)
	•	Organizations are also seen as “open” in that they are constantly interacting with the outside environment, both influencing and being influenced by boarder social and political forces (Sagan, 1995)
	•	Organizations will seek to maintain their autonomy against outside pressures and numerous studies have noted the degree to which tensions exist between an industry and a regulatory agency created by the political authorities to monitor its behaviour. (Sagan, 1995)
	•	Organizations not only harm us, but are alone capable of salvation when things go awry. This dependence on organizations is appropriate, even helpful, most of the time. Complex, formal organizations, on balance, are better at solving big problems—including responding to disasters—than individuals, small groups, or nations. Most of the time at least. (Clarke, 1999)
	•	organizations, again most of the time, are better planners than individuals, small groups, etc. The reason organizations are better planners is partly because they have unique and often extended access to many types of resources (Clarke, 1999)
	•	Organizations, especially large organizations, have more money, person-power, and coordinative capability to accomplish tasks. Organizations also have a property that individuals (at least healthy individuals) don't have—they can differentiate, or splinter and divide themselves into ever finer units. (Clarke, 1999)
	•	organizations can benefit from the experience of the vast number of individual members, storing information, and developing explanations about what works and what doesn't so that others can use it. In this way they make knowledge transitive across individuals. (Clarke, 1999)
	•	
Modern organization
	•	Modem organizations bear us fruits unimaginable to our ancestors, but they can also create tragedy unparalleled in history. It is organizations that create technologies and production processes that give us modern disasters. It is organizations that construct the most important plans for responding to disasters. It is organizations that socially construct risk, danger, and safety. (Clarke, 1999)
	•	I want to develop this view a bit. A signal feature of modem existence is the prevalence of organizations in nearly every aspect of social life. (Clarke, 1999)
Fractal properties of organization
	•	That organizations are fractal means they can overcome the cognitive limitations of individuals when faced with a problem. (Clarke, 1999)
	•	splintering organizations and splintering problems don't guarantee that a good set of solutions will arise (Clarke, 1999)
	•	a broader set of solutions is more likely to emerge from such a process than if a single individual were handed the problem. In other words, when the problems get big, organization is the proper response. (Clarke, 1999)
Organization culture
	•	Of the three main dimensions of an organization (culture, structure, process), culture is probably the easiest to neglect and most difficult to observe and change. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Culture is difficult to observe because it is less tangible than structure and process, but a researcher could directly observe organizational personnel in case they betray normative noncompliance with, negative valuations of, or incorrect beliefs about security and risk management. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Changing a culture is difficult, but obvious solutions include exemplary leadership, more awareness of the desired culture, more rewards for compliance with the desired culture, more punishments for noncompliance, and more enforcement of compliance. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Ultimately, culture is changed and maintained only by congruence with structure and process, training of and communication to personnel of the desired culture, and cultural congruence across all departments and levels from managers downwards. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	“business processes and organizational culture ultimately determine the effectiveness of (interagency) collaboration.” “business processes and organizational culture ultimately determine the effectiveness of (interagency) collaboration.” The report highlighted impediments to collaboration such as “a cultural tradition inconsistent with information sharing; lack of common goals for collaboration across the community; lack of trust in organizations, individuals and systems; lack of perceived mutual benefit to participate in collaboration efforts; and inadequate reward systems to support collaboration.” (Marrin, 2002)
Bad organizational culture
	•	[…] a bad culture is betrayed by repeated failures to implement processes, to exercise authority, or to take responsibility for risk management. Ideally, such repeated failures should be observed currently by regular monitoring and reviewing and should prompt an audit that would diagnose the root causes. (Newsome, 2013)
Organization structure
	•	Structures are patterns of authorities and responsabilities. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Structure is important because security and risk receive improper attention when the responsibilities or authorities are unclear or dysfunctional. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Structure is important also to outsiders who want to know with whom to communicate. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Structure is important to the efficiency of an organization, since clearer authorities and responsabilities reduce the transactions costs and redundant activities associated with confused or redundant authorities. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Two main trade-offs are with the control of the organizational designer: the trade-off between managerial control and burden and the trade-off between domain and cross-domain expertise. (Newsome, 2013)
Small organization
	•	A small organization or operation is likely to be specialized in a certain domain. (Newsome, 2013)
Large organization
	•	In large organizations, with cross-domain functions, domain specializations are required within departments, but are problematic across departments. (Newsome, 2013)
Organization coordination
	•	Coordination between organizations implies benefits such as mutually improved security and reduced collective costs. (Newsome, 2013)
Organization of uncertainty 
	•	It will be argued that the organization of uncertainty in the form of risk management designs and standards is related to expectations of governance and demands for defendable, auditable process. (Power, 2009)
	•	organized uncertainty which motivates this book therefore captures both the sense of organizations as processors of uncertainty (by formal risk management and other means) and the sense of organizations as producers of risk, sometimes resulting from the very effort to seek reliability (Busby, 2006). (Power, 2009)

Organizational behaviour
	•	Organizational behaviour studies the impact of group and other social influences on role-related behaviours, on personal feeling of motivation and commitment, and on communication within the organization setting. (Furnham, 2005)
Organization development
	•	Organizational development concerns planned changes within organizations that can involve people, work procedures, job design and technology, and the structure of organizational relationships. (Furnham, 2005)
Organizational  design
	•	Organizational design conventionally recognizes three main dimensions of an organization, and this chapter’s sections study each of these in turn: culture, structure, and process. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Defects of organizational design are seldom clearly greater than those of alternatives, and legal inhibitions seldom, if ever, caused an otherwise avoidable failure in warning. (Betts, 2007)
Organizational culture
	•	Organizational culture is a set of values and norms that pervade military and intelligence organizations to the point of changing individual belief systems and creating shared perceptions. It purportedly leads group members to ignore deviant facts that contradict the common conceptions. This conformism stems from the need to maintain consensus and espirit de corps in the agency. (Honig, 2007)
	•	Different organizations have different cultures, a generalization as true for intel- ligence and national security agencies as it is for businesses. Knowledge is trans- mitted and the task at hand approached in highly different ways, with profound implications for overall performance. (Byman, 2005)

Organized anarchy
	•	such organizational anarchies” exhibit three general models. (Sagan, 1995)
	•	First, instead of having clear and consistent objectives, “the organization operates on the basis of a variety of inconsistent and ill-defined preferences.” (Sagan, 1995)
	•	Second, such organizations use extremely “unclear technology” in their operations
	•	Third, there is extremely “fluid participation” in the organization’s decision-making process. (Sagan, 1995)
Organized uncertainty
	•	‘Organized uncertainty' is an inherently paradoxical idea which signifies that efforts to construct a knowledge of things as risks creates new forms of uncertainties (Power, 2009)
Othello’s error
	•	Non-verbal cues are much more ambiguous and indirect. There is no dictionary to tell you what this or that means. It depends on the individual and the context. If you are not careful, you will glean signs but quickly interpret them to fit your own emotional biases about people, which will make your observations not only useless but also dangerous. If you are observing someone you naturally dislike, or who reminds you of someone unpleasant in your past, you will tend to see almost any cue as unfriendly or hostile. You will do the opposite for people you like. In these exercises you must strive to subtract your personal preferences and prejudices about people. Related to this is what is known as Othello’s error. (Greene, 2018)
	•	In the play Othello by Shakespeare, the main character, Othello, assumes that his wife, Desdemona, is guilty of adultery based on her nervous response when questioned about some evidence. In truth Desdemona is innocent, but the aggressive, paranoid nature of Othello and his intimidating questions make her nervous, which he interprets as a sign of guilt. What happens in such cases is that we pick up certain emotional cues from the other person—nervousness, for instance—and we assume they come from a certain source. We rush to the first explanation that fits what we want to see. But the nervousness could have several explanations, could be a temporary reaction to our questioning or the overall circumstances. The error is not in the observing but in the decoding. (Greene, 2018)
Otherness
	•	Our natural tendency is to project onto other people our own beliefs and value systems, in ways in which we are not even aware. When it comes to studying another culture, it is only through the use of our empathic powers and by participating in their lives that we can begin to overcome these natural projections and arrive at the reality of their experience. To do so we must overcome our great fear of the Other and the unfamiliarity of their ways. We must enter their belief and value systems, their guiding myths, their way of seeing the world. Slowly, the distorted lens through which we first viewed them starts to clear up. Going deeper into their Otherness, feeling what they feel, we can discover what makes them different and grasp their reality. This ability to understand from the inside-out is an essential part of mastery.  (Greene, 2014)
Outcome
	•	Outcomes are “a description of salient features of the future strategic context, with an associated level of confidence” (U.K. Ministry of Defense [MOD], 2010a, pp. 5–6) (Newsome, 2013)
Overeducation
	•	Overeducation describes the extent to which an individual possesses a level ofeducation in excess of that which is required for their particular job. (McGuinness, 2006)
	•	Overeducation is potentially costly to the economy, the firm and the individual.At a macroeconomic level, national welfare is potentially lower than would be thecase if the skills of all overeducated workers were fully utilized within the economy; in addition, it may be that tax revenues are also being wasted onequipping individuals with non-productive education. At a firm level, there issome evidence to suggest that overeducation is associated with lower productivity. (McGuinness, 2006)
	•	As individuals, overeducated workers, by virtue of the fact that a proportion oftheir educational investment is unproductive, are likely to earn a lower return ontheir investment relative to similarly educated individuals whose jobs match theireducation. (McGuinness, 2006)
	•	Overeducated workers may also incur non-transitory costs associatedwith lower levels of job satisfaction (again see Tsanget  al., 1991; Battuet  al.,2000). It is also possible that previously well-matched workers in the economy willbe ‘bumped down’ in the labour market and, perhaps out of it entirely, as over-educated workers move into lower level occupations thus raising the mean educa-tional level within these occupations rendering some previously adequatelyeducated individuals undereducated. (McGuinness, 2006)
	•	In fact, Sloane (2003) arguesthat the major contribution of the overeducation literature has been to widen thedebate on the importance of job characteristics in determining wages thus broad-ening the human capital framework. (McGuinness, 2006)
Over-estimation
	•	over-estimation, that temporary suspension of the critical pendulum, was only an artifice for luring forth the soul of the thing.” (Greene, 2018)
Overlay
	•	The secondcondition occurs when the direct presence of outside powers in a region isstrong enough to suppress the normal operation of security dynamicsamong the local states. This condition is called overlay, which normallyinvolves extensive stationing of armed forces in the area overlain by theintervening great power(s) and is quite distinct from the normal process ofintervention by great powers into the affairs of local security complexes. (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	Overlay means one or more external powers moves directly into theregional complex with the effect of suppressing the indigenous securitydynamic. (Buzan et al., 1997)
P
Panic
	•	Panics are typically set off by highly vivid cases, or clusters of cases, that receive concentrated media attention (Weinstein, 1989, p. 46). (Loewenstein et al., 2001)
	•	« comportements dans les catastrophes », mais la plupart des autres auteurs optent pour le terme pourtant plus littéraire et ambigu de « panique ». (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	il semble, que « catastrophe » et « panique » soient liées par un rapport de causalité, l’une déterminant l’autre. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	une panique a de fortes chances de se produire s’il existe une conjoncture socio-économique sensibilisante, comme la menace d’un conflit ou d’une guerre, d’une catastrophe imminente, ou encore d’un moment de crise, d’inflation ou de récession. En second, la panique touche principalement les personnalités fragiles, présentant un degré élevé d’émotivité ou d’anxiété ». (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Mais quoi qu’il en soit des réactions comportementales observées, elles sont toutes étroitement liées à la personnalité individuelle qu’elles expriment seulement en en exagérant les traits. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	la condition nécessaire pour qu’apparaisse une panique : il faut qu’une possibilité de fuite existe, mais qu’elle soit contrebalancée par la menace d’être pris au piège. (Mannoni, 1985)
Public panic
	•	Fear increases arousal Attacks of panic can be seen at a societal level (Bartholomew, 1997). Such social panics are characterized by an explosion of public concern about a problem—typically unconnected with any sudden change in the underlying risk—followed by an also-sudden collapse of concern (Weinstein, 1989, p. 37).  and arousal increases the intensity of new fear responses (Lang, 1995). (Loewenstein et al., 2001)
	•	public panics seem to be fueled, in part, by an interplay between anxiety, fear, and subjective probabilities. (Loewenstein et al., 2001)
Panic process
	•	Pour cet auteur, on peut distinguer trois périodes : précritique, caractérisée par la présence de deux attitudes divergentes (le danger est nié ou, au contraire, très exagéré), critique ou phase de choc, pendant laquelle les individus gardent leur sang-froid, sont complètement inhibés ou hyper-agités, postcritique comportant des réactions émotionnelles importantes liées au bouleversement affectif et social ou à la crainte du retour de la catastrophe, certains sujets restant marqués à vie. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Mais quoi qu’il en soit des réactions comportementales observées, elles sont toutes étroitement liées à la personnalité individuelle qu’elles expriment seulement en en exagérant les traits. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	la condition nécessaire pour qu’apparaisse une panique : il faut qu’une possibilité de fuite existe, mais qu’elle soit contrebalancée par la menace d’être pris au piège. (Mannoni, 1985)
Pandemic
	•	Pandemics—like avian flu, SARS, or swine flu—spread in the airport network. Climate change can alter the network of relations between species in ecosystems. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
	•	Epidemics spread in networks both at the global level (for example, through the airport network) and at the local level: infectious diseases that jump from person to person depend on individuals’ social networks. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
Pandemic spread
	•	In the 14th century, physical distance was a leading factor in the spread of an epidemic. In the modern networked world, an infection can jump on a plane and reach the opposite side of the planet in a few hours. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
Paper
Options papers
	•	Often it is important to decisionmakers to know how to get to the least bad outcome, to limit the damage. I think options papers work very well here, especially if they are delivered after bad news forces key policymakers to focus on an issue. (Davis, 1995)
Parents
Enmeshers
	•	the parents could be enmeshers—overinvolved in the child’s life, suffocating it with attention, isolating it from others, and living through its advancement as a means to validate their own Self-worth. (Greene, 2018)
Paradigm
	•	A paradigm provides a common set of puzzles that guides research. (Honig, 2007)
	•	Abandonment of a fundamental paradigm may owe as much to the death or retirement of an older generation of scientists as to the success of the new model in winning them over. (Weiss, 2008)
	•	Accepted ways of explaining reality. (Greene, 2014)
	•	sometimes these paradigms end up dominating our way of thinking. (Greene, 2014) 
	•	We routinely look for patterns in the world that confirm the paradigms we already believe in. (Greene, 2014)
	•	The things that do not fit the paradigm—the anomalies—tend to be ignored or explained away. (Greene, 2014)
Paradigm change
	•	Now, if there are events, not necessarily arguments, which cause us to adopt new standards, including new and more complex forms of argu- mentation, will it then not be up to the defenders of the status quo to provide, not just arguments, but also contrary causes? (Virtue without terror is ineffective, says Robespierre.) And if the old forms of argumentation turn out to be too weak a cause, must not these defenders either give up or resort to stronger and more "irrational" means? (It is very difficult, and perhaps entirely impossible, to combat the effects of brainwashing by argument.) (Feyerabend, 1993)
Paradoxes
	•	Paradoxes are favoured by philosophers for the insights they provide; as Bertrand Russell once remarked, the work of good philosophy is to begin with a statement that is regarded as too obvious to be of interest and from it to deduce a conclusion no one will believe (Barrow 2005:22). (Coker, 2009)
Parameters
	•	In physical models, parameters are used to represent things like the temperature at which water boils, or the mass of the Earth, or the speed of light, or even the speed with which ice ‘falls’ in the upper atmosphere. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
	•	Many models contain ‘free’ parameters, meaning parameters which, unlike the speed of light or the freezing point of water, we do not already know with good accuracy. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
	•	best parameters are those whose predictions fall closest to their targets. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
Paris
	•	Cette forme de vaisseau avait aussi frappé les scribes héraldiques ; car c'est de là, et non du siège des normands, que vient, selon Favyn et Pasquier, le navire qui blasonne le vieil écusson de Paris. (Hugo and Chamarat, 1998)
Parisian
	•	voilà maître Andrea obligé de vivre comme un fils de famille parisien, en bizeautant des cartes ou en pipant des dés. Kindle Edition. (Dumas, 1998)
Pareto improvement
	•	Pareto improvement is a reallocation of resources (e.g. a decision to develop) that makes at least one individual better off without making anyone worse off (Torriti and Ikpeb, 2014)
Pareto optimality
	•	Pareto efficiency/optimality is achieved when it is impossible to make one individual better off without making at least one other individual worse off (Torriti and Ikpeb, 2014)
	•	Under Pareto efficiency, an outcome is more efficient if at least one person is made better off and no one is made worse off (Torriti and Ikpeb, 2014)
	•	An allocation is defined as "Pareto efficient" or "Pareto optimal" when no further Pareto improvements can be made (Torriti and Ikpeb, 2014)
Parliamentary assembly
	•	Les foules parlementaires présentent la plupart des caractères communs aux foules hétérogènes non anonymes. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Les assemblées parlementaires représentent des foules hétérogènes non anonymes. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Le régime parlementaire représente d'ailleurs l'idéal de tous les peuples civilisés modernes. Il traduit cette idée, psychologiquement erronée mais généralement admise, que beaucoup d'hommes réunis sont bien plus capables qu'un petit nombre de prendre une décision sage et indépendante sur un sujet donné. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Nous retrouvons dans les assemblées parlementaires les caractéristiques générales des foules: le simplisme des idées, l'irritabilité, la suggestibilité, l'exagération des sentiments, l'influence prépondérante des meneurs. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Le simplisme des opinions est une de leurs caractéristiques les plus importantes. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	On y rencontre dans tous les partis, chez les peuples latins surtout, une tendance invariable à résoudre les problèmes sociaux les plus compliqués par les principes abstraits les plus simples, et par des lois générales applicables à tous les cas. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Les foules parlementaires sont très suggestibles; et, comme pour toutes les foules, la suggestion émane de meneurs possédant du prestige; mais, dans les assemblées parlementaires, la suggestibilité a des limites très nettes qu'il importe de marquer. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Sur des questions générales: renversement d'un ministère, établissement d'un impôt, etc., il n'y a plus du tout de fixité d'opinion, et les suggestions des meneurs peuvent agir, mais pas tout à fait comme dans une foule ordinaire. Chaque parti a ses meneurs, qui ont parfois une égale influence. Il en résulte que le député se trouve entre des suggestions contraires et devient fatalement très hésitant. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	à chaque législature, une Chambre a des opinions très fixes et d'autres opinions très indécises. Au fond, les questions générales étant les plus nombreuses, c'est l'indécision qui domine, indécision entretenue par la crainte constante de l'électeur, dont la suggestion latente tend toujours à contre-balancer l'influence des meneurs. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Ce sont cependant les meneurs qui sont en définitive les vrais maîtres dans les discussions nombreuses où les membres d'une assemblée n'ont pas d'opinions antérieures bien arrêtées. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	La nécessité de ces meneurs est évidente puisque, sous le nom de chefs de groupes, on les retrouve dans les assemblées de tous les pays. Ils sont les vrais souverains d'une assemblée. Les hommes en foule ne sauraient se passer d'un maître. Et c'est pourquoi les votes d'une assemblée ne représentent généralement que les opinions d'une petite minorité. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Les meneurs agissent très peu par leurs raisonnements, beaucoup par leur prestige. Et la meilleure preuve, c'est que si une circonstance quelconque les en dépouille, ils n'ont plus d'influence. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Ce prestige des meneurs est individuel et ne tient ni au nom ni à la célébrité. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	«Les assemblées politiques sont le lieu de la terre où l'éclat du génie se fait le moins sentir. On n'y tient compte que d'une éloquence appropriée au temps et au lieu, et des services rendus non à la patrie, mais aux partis. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Dans une assemblée parlementaire, le succès d'un discours dépend presque uniquement du prestige que l'orateur possède, et pas du tout des raisons qu'il propose. Et, la meilleure preuve, c'est que lorsqu'une cause quelconque fait perdre à un orateur son prestige, il perd du même coup toute son influence, c'est-à-dire le pouvoir de diriger à son gré les votes. Quant à l'orateur inconnu qui arrive avec un discours contenant de bonnes raisons, mais seulement des raisons, il a des chances d'être seulement écouté. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Lorsque les assemblées parlementaires se trouvent montées à un certain degré d'excitation, elles deviennent identiques aux foules hétérogènes ordinaires, et leurs sentiments présentent par conséquent la particularité d'être toujours extrêmes. On les verra se porter aux plus grands actes d'héroïsme ou aux pires excès. L'individu n'est plus lui-même, et il l'est si peu qu'il votera les mesures les plus contraires à ses intérêts personnels. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	L'histoire de la Révolution montre à quel point les assemblées peuvent devenir inconscientes et obéir aux suggestions les plus contraires à leurs intérêts. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Les assemblées parlementaires suffisamment excitées et hypnotisées présentent les mêmes caractères. Elles deviennent un troupeau mobile obéissant à toutes les impulsions. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Il s'en faut de beaucoup heureusement que tous les caractères que nous venons de décrire dans les assemblées parlementaires se manifestent constamment. Elles ne sont foules qu'à certains moments. Les individus qui les composent arrivent à garder leur individualité dans un grand nombre de cas; et c'est pourquoi une assemblée peut élaborer des lois techniques excellentes. Ces lois ont, il est vrai, pour auteur un homme spécial qui les a préparées dans le silence du cabinet; et la loi votée est en réalité l'œuvre d'un individu, et non plus celle d'une assemblée. Ce sont naturellement ces lois qui sont les meilleures. Elles ne deviennent désastreuses que lorsqu'une série d'amendements malheureux les rendent collectives. L'œuvre d'une foule est partout et toujours inférieure à celle d'un individu isolé. Ce sont les spécialistes qui sauvent les assemblées des mesures trop désordonnées et trop inexpérimentées. Le spécialiste est alors un meneur momentané. L'assemblée n'agit pas sur lui et il agit sur elle. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Malgré toutes les difficultés de leur fonctionnement, les assemblées parlementaires représentent ce que les peuples ont encore trouvé de meilleur pour se gouverner et surtout pour se soustraire le plus possible au joug des tyrannies personnelles. Elles sont certainement l'idéal d'un gouvernement, au moins pour les philosophes, les penseurs, les écrivains, les artistes et les savants, en un mot pour tout ce qui constitue le sommet d'une civilisation. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Le premier de ces dangers est la conséquence forcée des exigences et de l'imprévoyance des foules électorales. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Le second des dangers mentionnés plus haut, la restriction forcée des libertés par les assemblées parlementaires, moins visible en apparence est cependant fort réel. Il est la conséquence des innombrables lois—toujours restrictives—dont les parlements, avec leur esprit simpliste, voient mal les conséquences, et qu'ils se croient obligés de voter. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	indépendant de son électeur, n'a pas réussi à s'y soustraire. Herbert Spencer, dans un travail déjà ancien, avait montré que l'accroissement de la liberté apparente devait être suivi d'une diminution de la liberté réelle. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Cette restriction progressive des libertés se manifeste pour tous les pays sous une forme spéciale, que Herbert Spencer n'a pas indiquée, et qui est celle-ci: La création de ces séries innombrables de mesures législatives, toutes généralement d'ordre restrictif, conduit nécessairement à augmenter le nombre, le pouvoir et l'influence des fonctionnaires chargés de les appliquer. Ils tendent ainsi progressivement à devenir les véritables maîtres des pays civilisés. Leur puissance est d'autant plus grande, que, dans les incessants changements de pouvoir, la caste administrative est la seule qui échappe à ces changements, la seule qui possède l'irresponsabilité, l'impersonnalité et la perpétuité. Or, de tous les despotismes, il n'en est pas de plus lourds que ceux qui se présentent sous cette triple forme. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Cette création incessante de lois et de règlements restrictifs entourant des formalités les plus byzantines les moindres actes de la vie, a pour résultat fatal de rétrécir de plus en plus la sphère dans laquelle les citoyens peuvent se mouvoir librement. Victimes de cette illusion qu'en multipliant les lois l'égalité et la liberté se trouvent mieux assurées, les peuples acceptent chaque jour de plus pesantes entraves. (Lebon, 1895)

Parliamentary regime
	•	Le régime parlementaire représente d'ailleurs l'idéal de tous les peuples civilisés modernes. Il traduit cette idée, psychologiquement erronée mais généralement admise, que beaucoup d'hommes réunis sont bien plus capables qu'un petit nombre de prendre une décision sage et indépendante sur un sujet donné. (Lebon, 1895)
Parkinson’s disease
	•	In Parkinson’s disease, a large portion of the neurons can disappear without the patient even noticing. But when this portion exceeds a certain threshold, then the disruptive condition starts to become manifest. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
Part-whole hierarchies
	•	part-whole hierarchies on the other hand, the superordinate concept is thought of as a whole, and the subordinate concept as a component or a part of it. (Sottilotta, 2016)
Patience
	•	we must develop patience, which is like a muscle that requires training and repetition to make it strong. (Greene, 2018)
Participatory process
	•	In a participatory process, opinions of all affected parties are considered in each phase of the decision. (Vari, 1995)
	•	Participatory processes help to make decisions which are supported by the affected parties. (Vari, 1995)
Parties
Responsible parties
	•	The responsible parties are supposed to manage security and risk as determined by the authorities. (Newsome, 2013)
Partisan
	•	‘Partisan’ thus originally referred only to the leader; gradually, it was applied also to the other members of the ‘partie’/‘Parthey’, the ‘Partheygänger’. (Heuser, 2010b)
	•	They were thus special forces, hired by a government or a general to work alongside regular forces. They were mercenaries, professional soldiers, often hailing from a tribe or ethnic group that specialised on this form of warfare, but they were not fighting for any ideology or even religious cause. (Heuser, 2010b)
	•	They fought in small formations: estimates of what the best size should be differed. (Heuser, 2010b)
Partner
	•	The Canadian government differentiates a contributor from a partner (“an individual, group, organization that might be affected by, or perceive itself to be affected by, an emergency”) (Public Safety Canada, 2012, pp. 19, 71). (Newsome, 2013)
	•	The word partner is often used in the sense of ally, but in risk management, a partner could be sharing negative risks but not necessarily contributing positive risks, so the word partner does not mean the same as contributor. (Newsome, 2013)
Conniving partner
	•	because of our blind spot, we suffer under the irresolute leader, the micromanaging boss, the conniving partner. This is the source of endless tragedies in history, our pattern as a species. (Greene, 2018)
Parochialism 
	•	prevents the analysts from seeing the big picture. (Honig, 2007)
Pattern
	•	Psychologist and political scientist Deborah Larson explains,Patterns are collections of cues that usually go together ... birds have beaks, wings, and feathers. A state that is planning to attack will mobilize its troops on the border, stockpile supplies, issue threats, etc. (Honig, 2007)
	•	A pattern is any distinctly organized sequence. (Brown, 2018)
	•	real patterns don’t go on forever. (Stewart, 2013)
Highly consistent patterns
	•	Highly consistent patterns are most often observed when the input variables are highly redundant or correlated. (Tversky and Kahneman, 1974)
Pattern of amity and enmity
	•	The pattern of amity and enmity is normally best understood by starting the analysis from the regional level, and extending it towards inclusion of the global actors on the one side and domestic factors on the other. (Buzan and Wæver, 2003) 
Pattern of conflict
	•	pattern of conflict stems from factors indigenous to the region – such as, for instance, in South Asia or in the Middle East – and outside powers cannot (even if heavily involved) usually define, desecuritise, or reorganise the region. (Buzan and Wæver, 2003)
Pattern of who fears or likes
	•	The specific pattern of who fears or likes whom is generally not imported from the system level, but generated internally in the region by a mixture of history, politics, and material conditions. (Buzan and Wæver, 2003)
Pattern recognition
	•	the cognitive phenomenon of ‘‘pattern recognition’’ enables experienced experts (e.g., doctors, master chess players) to immediately perceive patterns, even in voluminous data with many contradictory signals.This extraordinary feat is possible since patterns stored in Long-Term Memory enable experts to process many bits of information together as a single chunk or schema. (Honig, 2007)
Recuring pattern
	•	A recurring pattern means that some properties of world states recur, even though the states themselves do not recur. (Holland, 2014)
Peack experience
	•	These are moments in which you are lifted out of the daily grind and you sense that there is something larger and more sublime in life that you have been missing. (Greene, 2018)
	•	They have the effect, as they did with Chekhov, of altering your attitude for good. They expand what you think about your possibilities and about life itself, and the memory is something you will always return to for supreme inspiration. (Greene, 2018)
Peer-review
	•	Peer review is a complex issue, one that is widely misunderstood by the public and by some individuals in the regulatory and legal systems. (Michaels, 2008)
	•	Peer review is just one component of a larger quality control process through which scientific knowledge is developed and tested—a process that never ends. (Michaels, 2008)
	•	Articles that have been published in peer-review journals are assumed, often mistakenly,to be of high quality. This is not necessarily so. (Michaels, 2008)
	•	Peer review, or independent review by experts, is a pillar of modern science, a phenomenally complex enterprise in which scientists are constantly evaluating and building upon each other’s work. (Michaels, 2008)
Peer-review procedures
	•	Quality-control and peer-review procedures are particularly important when new approaches are introduced into the risk-assessment process. (National Research Council (U.S.) et al., 2009)
	•	peer-review program gives attention to new approaches and individual risk assessments. (National Research Council (U.S.) et al., 2009)
Peer-review “spirals”
	•	Peer-review “spirals” involve repeated reviews that return assessments to the agency for further revision because the agency has not responded adequately to science-based recommendations in earlier reviews or because of science-policy debates or inadequacies in the peer-review process itself (GAO 2001). (National Research Council (U.S.) et al., 2009)
Penetration
	•	What links the overarching pattern of distribution of power among the global powers to the regional dynamics of RSCs is the mechanism of penetration. (Buzan and Wæver, 2003)
	•	Penetration occurs when outside powers make security alignments with states within an RSC. (Buzan and Wæver, 2003) 
Perceptions
	•	A concept or perception, as Jervis and Lebow stated, can be changed either when one gets new unequivocal information that runs counter to one’s perception or when a changed reality hits one in the face. (Kahana, 2002)
	•	The process of perception links people to their environment and is critical to accurate understanding of the world about us. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	perception is demonstrably an active rather than a passive process; it constructs rather than records “reality.” (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Perception implies understanding as well as awareness. It is a process of inference in which people construct their own version of reality on the basis of information provided through the five senses. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	We tend to perceive what we expect to perceive. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	A corollary of this principle is that it takes more information, and more unambiguous information, to recognize an unexpected phenomenon than an expected one. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Perception is also influenced by the context in which it occurs. Different circumstances evoke different sets of expectations. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Initial exposure to blurred or ambiguous stimuli interferes with accurate perception even after more and better information becomes available. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	people form some sort of tentative hypothesis about what they see. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	The early but incorrect impression tends to persist because the amount of information necessary to invalidate a hypothesis is considerably greater than the amount of information required to make an initial interpretation. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	The problem is not that there is any inherent difficulty in grasping new perceptions or new ideas, but that established perceptions are so difficult to change. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	People form impressions on the basis of very little information, but once formed, they do not reject or change them unless they obtain rather solid evidence. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	the greater the ambiguity of the stimuli, the greater the impact of expectations and pre-existing images on the perception of that stimuli. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	early judgment adversely affects the formation of future perceptions. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Concepts and schemata stored in memory exercise a powerful influence on the formation of perceptions from sensory data. (Heuer, 1999)

Inaccurate perception
	•	Comprehending the nature of perception has significant implications for understanding the nature and limitations of intelligence analysis. The circumstances under which accurate perception is most difficult are exactly the circumstances under which intelligence analysis is generally conducted—dealing with highly ambiguous situations on the basis of information that is processed incrementally under pressure for early judgment. This is a recipe for inaccurate perception. (Heuer, 1999)

Perceptions of risks
	•	Perceptions of risks to public health varied by infectious disease (Roberts, 2001b)
Perception of control
	•	perceptions of control are associated with perceptions of personal risk estimates rather than target risk estimates. The greater one’s perception of control, the lower one’s personal risk estimates. (Klein and Helweg-Larsen, 2002)
Perception management
	•	Perception management can be difficult as legitimacy is dynamic and a company can lose legitimacy due to shifts in the interests of their relevant publics or the composition of their relevant publics (O’Donovan 2002). (Summerhays and de Villiers, 2012)
Perseveration
	•	the willingness to adhere to a line of thought once begun, even when evidence points to the contrary. (Goodman, 2007)

Performance
	•	performance is a behavioral construct. (LePine et al., 2000)
	•	Performance designates an agent’s behavioural repertoire at a point in time, typically specified by a set of conditional IF/THEN rules. (Holland, 2014)
Performance history
	•	Performance history is one manifestation of stability. When an organization has a history of crises, an individual crisis should be perceived as more stable than a crisis that has happened only once. The greater the perceived stability of a crisis, the stronger perceptions of organizational responsibility should be (Griffin, 1994). The more publics perceive an organization as responsible for a crisis, the stronger a crisis's negative impact on the organization should be. (Coombs and Holladay, 1996)
Contextual performance
	•	team members' contextual performance can be thought of as the building blocks of teamwork. (LePine et al., 2000)
	•	involves behaviors that support the social, organizational and psychological environment in which task behaviors are performed. (LePine et al., 2000)
	•	Contextual performance is similar to other behavioral patterns studied in the organizational behavior domain, such as prosocial organizational behavior (Brief & Motowidlo, 1986),  organizational citizenship behavior (Organ,  1988), and extra-role behavior (Van Dyne, Cummings & Parks, 1995). (LePine et al., 2000)
	•	Contextual performance, on the other hand, should be more strongly related to individual differences in personality characteristics than to individual differences in ability. (LePine et al., 2000)
	•	Contextual performance dimensions, on the other hand, are more strongly related to personality predictors (Campbell, McHenry & Wise, 1990; LePine & Van Dyne, in press (a)); Motowidlo &  Van  Scotter,   1994). (LePine et al., 2000)
	•	contextual performance is  likely to become even more important for organizational effectiveness if organizations evolve toward increasingly organic structures that rely more and more heavily on relatively autonomous teams in order  to adapt to increasingly turbulent and unpredictable environments. (LePine et al., 2000)
	•	contextual performance is importantly different from task performance in at least three ways. First, task activities vary considerably across jobs  whereas contextual activities tend to be more similar across jobs. (Borman and Motowidlo, 1997)
	•	contextual performance has a  significant impact on overall performance ratings. (Borman and Motowidlo, 1997)
Task performance
	•	task performance, involves behaviors that directly transform or directly support the transformation of raw materials into the organization's products. Examples of behaviors that contribute to this type of performance include operating a machine in a manufacturing plant or purchasing raw materials to be used in the production process. (LePine et al., 2000)
	•	Task performance should be more strongly related to individual differences in ability than to individual differences in personality characteristics. (LePine et al., 2000)
	•	Task performance can be defined as the effectiveness with which job incumbents perform activities that contribute to the organization's technical core either directly by implementing a part of its technological  process, or indirectly by providing it with needed materials or services (Borman & Motowidlo, 1993). (Borman and Motowidlo, 1997)
Job performance
	•	Job performance can be defined generally as the degree to which an individual helps the organization  achieve its goals (Campbell,  1983). (LePine et al., 2000)
Performance behaviors
	•	Performance behaviors are coherent action. (LePine et al., 2000)
People
	•	See people as facts of nature. They come in all varieties, like flowers or rocks. There are fools and saints and sociopaths and egomaniacs and noble warriors; there are the sensitive and the insensitive. They all play a role in our social ecology. (Greene, 2018)
	•	You must accept diversity and the fact that people are what they are. That they are different from you should not be felt as a challenge to your ego or self-esteem but as something to welcome and embrace. (Greene, 2018)
	•	From this more neutral stance, you can then try to understand the people you deal with on a deeper level, as Chekhov did with his father. The more you do this, the more tolerant you will tend to become toward people and toward human nature in general. Your open, generous spirit will make your social interactions much smoother, and people will be drawn to you. (Greene, 2018)
Authentic people
	•	In the course of our lives we inevitably meet people who appear to be especially comfortable with themselves. They display certain traits that help give this impression: they are able to laugh at themselves; they can admit to certain shortcomings in their character, as well as to mistakes they have made; they have a playful, sometimes impish edge to them, as if they have retained more of the child within; they can play their role in life with a little bit of distance (see the last section of chapter 3). At times they can be charmingly spontaneous. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Those who emit that air of authenticity signal to us another possibility—that of being an adult who has managed to integrate the child and the adult, the dark and the light, the unconscious and the conscious mind. We yearn to be around them. Perhaps some of their energy will rub off on us. (Greene, 2018)
Peuple
	•	Le peuple, au moyen-âge surtout, est dans la société ce qu'est l'enfant dans la famille. Tant qu'il reste dans cet état d'ignorance première, de minorité morale et intellectuelle, on peut dire de lui comme de l'enfant : Cet âge est sans pitié.Hugo, Victor. (Hugo and Chamarat, 1998)
	•	Un peuple est un organisme créé par le passé, et qui, comme tout organisme, ne peut se modifier que par de lentes accumulations héréditaires. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Les peuples ne sont pas gouvernés comme le voudraient leurs caprices d'un moment, mais comme l'exige leur caractère. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Le caractère des peuples et non les gouvernements conduit leurs destinées. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Les peuples sont gouvernés par leur caractère, et toutes les institutions qui ne sont pas intimement moulées sur ce caractère ne représentent qu'un vêtement d'emprunt, un déguisement transitoire. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Le grand facteur de l'évolution des peuples n'a jamais été la vérité, mais bien l'erreur. Et si le socialisme est si puissant aujourd'hui, c'est qu'il constitue la seule illusion qui soit vivante encore. Malgré toutes les démonstrations scientifiques, il continue à grandir. Sa principale force est d'être défendu par des esprits ignorant assez les réalités des choses pour oser promettre hardiment à l'homme le bonheur. (Lebon, 1895)
Pericles
	•	Pericles was beloved, and his opinion would matter more than anyone’s, but despite the Athenians’ respect for him, they found him a very peculiar leader—more of a philosopher than a politician. To those old enough to remember the start of his career, it was truly surprising how powerful and successful he had become. He did nothing the usual way. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Then Pericles entered public life around 463 BC, and Athenian politics would never be the same. His first move was the most unusual of all. Although he came from an illustrious aristocratic family, he allied himself with the growing lower and middle classes of the city—farmers, oarsmen in the navy, the craftsmen who were the pride of Athens. He worked to increase their voice in the Assembly and give them greater power in the democracy. This was not some small faction he now led but the majority of Athenian citizens. It would seem impossible to control such a large, unruly mob of men, with their varied interests, but he was so fervent in increasing their power that he slowly gained their trust and backing. (Greene, 2018)
	•	As his influence grew, he started to assert himself in the Assembly and alter its policies. He argued against expanding Athens’s democratic empire. He feared the Athenians would overreach and lose control. He worked to consolidate the empire and strengthen existing alliances. When it came to war and to serving as a general, he strove to limit campaigns and to win through maneuvers, with minimal loss of lives. To many this seemed unheroic, but as these policies took effect, the city entered a period of unprecedented prosperity. There were no more needless wars to drain the coffers, and the empire was functioning more smoothly than ever. (Greene, 2018)
	•	What Pericles did with the growing surplus of money startled and amazed the citizenry: instead of using it to buy political favors, he initiated a massive public building project in Athens. He commissioned temples, theaters, and concert halls, putting all of the Athenian craftsmen to work. Everywhere one looked, the city was becoming more sublimely beautiful. He favored a form of architecture that reflected his personal aesthetics—ordered, highly geometric, monumental yet soothing to the eye. His greatest commission was that of the Parthenon, with its enormous forty-foot statue of Athena. Athena was the guiding spirit of Athens, the goddess of wisdom and practical intelligence. She represented all of the values Pericles wanted to promote. Singlehandedly Pericles had transformed the look and spirit of Athens, and it entered a golden age in all of the arts and sciences. (Greene, 2018)
	•	What was perhaps the strangest quality of Pericles was his speaking style—restrained and dignified. He did not go in for the usual flights of rhetoric. Instead, he worked to convince an audience through airtight arguments. This would make people listen closely, as they followed the interesting course of his logic. The style was compelling and calming. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Unlike any of the other leaders, Pericles remained in power year after year, decade after decade, putting his total stamp on the city in his quiet, unobtrusive way. He had his enemies. This was inevitable. He had stayed in power so long that many accused him of being a secret dictator. He was suspected of being an atheist, a man who scoffed at all traditions. That would explain why he was so peculiar. But nobody could argue against the results of his leadership. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Pericles himself valued bold and adventurous action. He loved the spirit of Athena and the inspiration she brought. He wanted Athenians to feel love for their city and empathy for their fellow citizens. What he envisioned was a state of balance—a clear understanding of why we feel the way we do, conscious of our impulses so that we can think without being secretly compelled by our emotions. Pericles wanted the energy that comes from impulses and emotions to serve our thinking self. That was his vision of rationality, and our ideal. (Greene, 2018)
Peril
	•	Peril is something that is close to the risk and it has negative, non-profitable results. (Tchankova, 2002)
Persistence
	•	Do not be afraid to exaggerate the role of willpower. It is an exaggeration with a purpose. It leads to a positive self-fulfilling dynamic, and that is all you care about. See this shaping of your attitude as your most important creation in life, and never leave it to chance. (Greene, 2018)
Personnel psychology
	•	Personnel psychology examines the important role of individual differences in selecting and placing employees, appraising the level of employees’ work performance and in training recently hired, as well as veteran, employees to improve various aspects of their job-related behaviour. (Furnham, 2005)
Personnel
Generalists personnel
	•	generalists, rather than specialists, are perhaps more likely to see unexpected connections and cope with them. (Perrow, 1999)
Specialized personnel
	•	Specialized personnel tend not to bridge the wide range of possible interactions (Perrow, 1999)
Personality
	•	The word personality comes from the Latin persona, which means “mask.” In the public we all wear masks, and this has a positive function. If we displayed exactly who we are and spoke our minds truthfully, we would offend almost everyone and reveal qualities that are best concealed. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Having a persona, playing a role well, actually protects us from people looking too closely at us, with all of the insecurities that would churn up. In fact, the better you play your role, the more power you will accrue, and with power you will have the freedom to express more of your peculiarities. If you take this far enough, the persona you present will match many of your unique characteristics, but always heightened for effect. (Greene, 2018)
Personality theory
	•	In conversations we frequently hear personality referred to in such a way that individuals seem to be without discrimination in their risk-aversion or risk-taking propensities: someindividuals love risk taking so they take many risks, while others are risk averse and seek to avoid as many risks as they can. (Wildavsky and Dake, 1990)
Perspective
	•	The longer you can take the better, because perspective comes with time. Consider this like resistance training—the longer you can resist reacting, the more mental space you have for actual reflection, and the stronger your mind will become. (Greene, 2018)
Philosophy
	•	Philosophy and art speak volumes about what a culture believes about the nature of man, the role of government, and the temporal world. (Petersen, 2003)
	•	apprendre n'est pas savoir ; il y a les sachant et les savants : c'est la mémoire qui fait les uns, c'est la philosophie qui fait les autres.– Mais ne peut-on apprendre la philosophie  ? – La philosophie ne s'apprend pas ; la philosophie est la réunion des sciences acquises au génie qui les applique : la philosophie , c'est le nuage éclatant sur lequel le Christ a posé le pied pour remonter au ciel. (Dumas, 1998)
Confucian philosophy
	•	Confucian philosophy identifies five basic relationships emperor to subject, father to son, husband to wife, elder brother to younger brother, and friend to friend. Note that only one is considered to be between equals, and friend-to friend relationships are rare. Thus, friendship means something different in China than it does in the United States when Beijing calls someone an old friend of China, it is an attempt to confer a sense of obligation on the honouree and the notion that the normal order of things is superior inferior helps to explain why China often acts as it does. (Petersen, 2003)
Physiologically based pharmacokinetic 
	•	a valid PBPK model can estimate the dose that a human needs to ingest to achieve the same circulating blood concentration of benzene (or its metabolite phenol). (Williams and Paustenbach, 2002)
Pilot study
	•	[…] what a pilot study involves is a scaled-down version of the (at this stage proposed) survey procedure. The aim is to try out, not to secure the first survey responses. The intention is to challenge the proposed instrument, so that it can be adjusted for better effect, not to hope that all goes well and that pilot responses can be used in the final analysis (Davies et al., 2002)
Plagiarism
	•	in a phrase that is itself stolen from the nineteenth century plagiarist Comte de Lautréamont, that ‘Plagiarism is necessary. Progress depends on it. It sticks close to an author’s phrasing, exploits his expressions, deletes a false idea, replaces it with the right one. (Debord, 2012)
	•	Ideas improve. The meaning of words participates in the improvement. Plagiarism is necessary. Progress implies it. It squeezes the phrase of an author, makes use of its expressions, rubs out a false idea, replaces it with a true idea. (Debord, 2012)
Plague
	•	With the plague, no one is spared, no matter their wealth or station in life. Everyone is equally at risk. Feeling personally vulnerable and seeing the vulnerability of everyone else, people’s normal sense of difference and privilege is melted away, and an uncommon generalized empathy emerges. This could be a natural state of mind, if we could only envision the vulnerability and mortality of others as not separate from our own. (Greene, 2018)
Plan
	•	A plan is designed to lead to a positive, desired objective. If people considered the possible negative and positive consequences equally, they might find it hard to take any action. Inevitably they veer toward information that confirms the desired positive result, the rosy scenario, without realizing it. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Plans are a form of language, a way of expressing or communicating some thing. That "thing" can be anything from a claim about some mundane activity that will happen tomorrow (e.g. an appointment book) to a claim that super-knowledge allows experts to make decisions about a very vague future (e.g. the US Department of Energy's plans to bury high level radioactive waste safely). (Clarke, 1999)
	•	language, and hence a plan, is meaningful when it is shared. Language must be directed at someone else and that someone must share the meaning if what is being communicated is to be more than incoherent gibberish. (Clarke, 1999)
	•	plans are inherently idealized; they can't anticipate all contingencies. They would become too cumbersome and in fact might even strike us as unreal in their overattention to detail. Yet successful planning in cases of earthquakes, volcanoes, train wrecks, and the like show that such idealized conditions can derive from concrete histories and thereby lose their fantastic character. The important point is that representations of such capabilities come to be believed by people who work in organizations and by people who those organizations are supposed to protect. Those representations, inthe case of fantasy documents, are more rhetorical than accurate representations of what organizations can do. (Clarke, 1999)
	•	The plan does not depend on 'public' opinion, or an individual's opinion; it depends on an organization functioning to do theOwork and give public information." (Clarke, 1999)
	•	Some plans are fine-grained, others are quite coarse. What the plans share is that they are entirely made up, fantasies that grow out of an managerial need to do something about potentially grave danger. As these organizations do their planning they transform uncertainty into risk, and the main tool they use in that transformation is a rhetorical one. For now I want to introduce the three main sets offantasy documents I'll talk about: contingency plans for major oil spills, evacuation plans for civilian nuclear plants, and civil defense and post- nuclear war survival plans. (Clarke, 1999)
	•	Plans are, therefore, much more than blueprints for future action; they are also rhetorical devices designed to convince others of something. Symboli- cally, plans are public declarations that planners, or the planning orga- nization, have thought carefully about some problem and have developed the necessary wisdom and power to establish dominion over it. (Clarke, 1999)
Emergency plan
	•	An emergency plan is a “a document or collection of documents that sets out the overall framework for the initiation, management, co-ordination and control of personnel and assets to reduce, control or mitigate the effects ofan emergency” (U.K. Cabinet Office, 2013). (Newsome, 2013)
	•	occupant emergency plan is a spe- cialized document that describes the procedures and protocols used to protect occupants of the facility in an emergency. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	Similar to a security plan, an emergency management plan is a written document that communicates the policies and procedures to be followed in the event of an emergency. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	Emergency management plans are known under different names throughout the industry. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	An emergency contingency plan, unlike a security plan, is not executed on a daily or routine basis; rather, it is used only in the event of an emergency or for training purposes. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	Generally and for purposes of this text, an emergency may be defined as any event or combination of events that have the potential to negatively impact the organization’s mission or components of that mission for a period of time and that require immediate response and action to continue normal mission operations. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	Emergencies should be defined for the specific organization or industry for which the emer- gency management plan is written. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	Although not all types of emergencies can be foreseen, planning for the most predictable crisis will move the organization a long way toward being prepared for unforeseen emergencies. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	emergency management plans are reactive and should be prepared to address an emergency that is imminent or has already occurred, not to mitigate an emergency that can still be prevented. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	Security and risk management departments are typically the units charged with preparing and maintaining the emergency management plans. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	An emergency management plan has several critical elements. These elements may include an organizational chart of key response personnel, resource lists, on-site and off-site shelter locations, critical asset lists, location of vital records, mutual aid agreements, and law enforcement and other emergency response contact information. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	The organizational chart of key emergency response personnel is essential to the emergency management plan. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	Emergency response personnel should also meet on a regular basis to refine the plan, review their roles, and ensure the availability of resources. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	Although the security manual and emergency management plans serve as the primary policies and procedures of an effective security program, other policies should be developed as needed to address security personnel and phys- ical security measures. (Vellani, 2007)
Functionnal plan
	•	I've emphasized the importance of experience informulating functional plans. (Clarke, 1999)
Planning
	•	Everyone plans. (Clarke, 1999)
	•	Larger social units plan too. A youth organization plans to ask for money, a church plans to save souls, a corporation plans an expansion, a country plans a foreign invasion. Large social units that don't plan are judged ineffective, poorly managed, irresponsible, or sometimes just plain dumb. (Clarke, 1999)
	•	planning is a prosaic, and ubiquitous, fact of life (Clarke, 1999)
	•	organizations and experts use plans as forms of rhetoric, tools designed to convince audiences that they ought to believe what an organization says. In particular, some plans have so little instrumental utility in them that they warrant the label "fantasy document." (Clarke, 1999)
	•	rational, common-sense planning is possible under conditions of relatively low uncertainty (Clarke, 1999)
	•	Planning then becomes a sign that organizations hang on themselves, advertising their competence and forethought, announcing to all who would listen (Clarke, 1999)
	•	organizations try to control the uncontrollable. (Clarke, 1999)
	•	organizations plan are to get something done and to tell themselves what to do  (Clarke, 1999)
	•	planning is a strategic thing, a course of action chosen to maximize utilities, profits, or interests. (Clarke, 1999)
	•	the plan, if it is to be a good one, should specify as closely as possible which strategies the department will use to build on existing strengths and minimize existing weaknesses. (Clarke, 1999)
	•	Planning helps provide favorable conditions because if needs, wants, and gaps can be delineated then their costs (monetary and otherwise) can be calculated more easily, which can facilitate coordination and reduce waste. (Clarke, 1999)
	•	By drawing on collective memory and allocating resources to planning, organizations make the troubles they face more predictable. Put differently, when organizations plan they construct a map of which contingencies are to be considered relevant  (Clarke, 1999)
	•	organizations pay the most attention to uncertainties that have some important bearing on effectiveness. (Clarke, 1999)
	•	planning and uncertainty is that they are inversely related: the more planning, the less uncertainty. (Clarke, 1999)
	•	Operational, functional planning is what we usually think about when we bother to think about planning at all. Individuals and organizations expend considerable strategic energy in making functional plans that realize interests, utilities, or profits. But there are cases where the plan and the planning process themselves are the function. Sometimes organizations collect information but don't use it, or use their very collection efforts to signal that they are doing something about a problem.' Sometimes planning is more symbolically than operationally useful, the plans representing something other than a real capability to imagine the future and prepare for it. (Clarke, 1999)
	•	To make a plan is to claim expertise because planning, especially 
	•	high-technology planning, requires that organizations and experts lay claim to mastery and thoughtfulness about some issue. (Clarke, 1999)
	•	planning is deeply, unavoidably political. (Clarke, 1999)
	•	‘Planning’ is ‘a formalized procedure to produce [an] articulated result, in the form of an integrated system of decisions’. Its essenceare analysis and the processing of information. (Frühling, 2014)
	•	Planning is an inherently interactive, social process. A s books, speeches, and curses are directed at others, so are plans. (Clarke, 1999)
Functional planning
	•	Functional planning is when actors have meaningful history to draw on and some reasonable, estimable probability that their plans can actually accomplish their goals. The history and conceptual scheme necessary to make good sense of that history allow actors to have some confidence that their predictions are likely to work out according to expectations. There are two views of functional planning, one from common sense and one from scholarship on organizations. (Clarke, 1999)
	•	organizations attend mainly to uncertainties about whatever constraints might impede organizational success, though he focuses chiefly on information, or the most important kinds of "news" for organizational functioning. (Clarke, 1999)
Planning fallacy
	•	[…] planning fallacy to describe plans and forecasts that are unrealistically close to best-case scenarios could be improved by consulting the statistics of similar cases (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	The optimism of planners and decision makers is not the only cause of overruns (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	The failures of forecasting in these cases reflect the customers’ inability to imagine how much their wishes will escalate over time. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	The so-called planning fallacy, to which I personally plead guilty, is an example of a problem in which base rates are not given in numerical terms but must be abstracted from experience. (Heuer, 1999)
Planung der Restabfallbehandlung in der Region Norschwarzwald 
	•	PAN is made up of representatives of each county's parliament with a governing board consisting of their leading executives. (Lofstedt, 1999)
	•	PAN's professional staff have backgrounds in engineering, economics, and local planning. (Lofstedt, 1999)
	•	PAN was set up as the main vehicle to achieve the intra- regional waste plan as stipulated in federal legislation passed by the German Federal authorities. (Lofstedt, 1999)
	•	PAN hoped that by having citizens participate in the decision making process the final sitings of the plants would be more publicly acceptable, as citizens would be seen to have influenced the final decision. (Lofstedt, 1999)
Pleasure
Immediate pleasure
	•	We tend also to grab for things that offer immediate pleasure, even if we know about the negative long-term consequences. That is why people continue to smoke, drink, do drugs, or engage in any self-destructive behavior in which the destruction is not immediate and dramatic. (Greene, 2018)
Pleasure pursuit
	•	No matter the objects of the pursuit, they tend to lead to a dynamic of diminishing returns. The moments of pleasure we get tend to get duller through repetition. We need either more and more of the same or constantly new diversions. Our need often turns into an addiction, and with the dependency comes a diminishing of health and mental powers. We become possessed by the objects we crave and lose ourselves. Under the influence of drugs or alcohol, for instance, we can temporarily feel transported beyond the banality of our lives. (Greene, 2018)
Point estimates
	•	Point estimates refer to the use of a single value for each risk model parameter. resulting in a final estimate of risk that is also a single value. (Williams and Paustenbach, 2002)
Poisson regression models 
	•	Poisson regression models have played a prominent role in recent analyses of associations between indices of air quality in various urban areas and health outcomes such as mortality (Schwartz and Dockery, 1992; Schwartz, 1993) and hospital admissions (Burnett et al., 1994; Moolgavkar et al.. 1997) for specific causes (respiratory disease, heart disease). I n these analyses, daily counts of events (deaths or hospital admissions) in a defined geographical area arc regressed against levels of air pollution as measured at monitoring stations in that area. (Moolgavkar and Leubeck, 2002)
Polarity
Unipolarity
	•	Unipolarity might in its extreme form be an exception to this rule; when both sides of a local conflict are dependent on the same power, it is possible for that power to pressure the conflicting parties into peace processes (Buzan and Wæver, 2003)
Polarization
	•	Persistent nonconvergence — polarization — is in fact pathological. It occurs when factual issues become entangled in antagonistic cultural meanings that transform positions on them into badges of loyalty to opposing groups. (Kahan, 2015)
Polarization of attitudes
	•	Attitude polarization can certainly be “created” by pitting the beliefs of two extremes against each other, but this is unlikely to be an accurate charac- terization of the public at large. (van der Linden, 2016)
Polarization of view
	•	Polarization of views and escalation of rhetoric by partisans typically occur and new recruits are drawn into the conflicts. These social alignments tend to become anchors for subsequent interpretations of risk management and may become quite firm in the face of conflicting information. (Kasperson et al., 1988)
Police
	•	La justice et plus exactement la police — que l’on nomme précisément les forces de l’ordre — ont la mission officielle de garantir les biens et les personnes. (Mannoni, 1985)
Policy
	•	policy is about the future (Stilgoe et al., 2006)
	•	The reality of policy is that evidence is seldom tidy, facts can rarely be separated from values and decisions are needed quickly (Stilgoe et al., 2006)
	•	In practice, ‘policy’ finds its expression in what Terry L. Deibel referred to as ‘the statements and actions of government’, or ‘the output of what is often called the “policy process”’. (Frühling, 2014)
Policy inaction
	•	policy inaction (e.g. when lives are lost as a result of failure to prohibit a dangerous drug or evacuate a dangerous area) (Hood and Jones, 1996)
Policy-maker
	•	policy-maker consequently expects that his policies will achieve only part of what he hopes and at the same time will produce unanticipated consequences he would have preferred to avoid (Lindblom, 1959)
	•	policy-makers are willing to stretch the boundaries of advisory committees, and they are willing to rethink what they expect from experts, advice to government will benefit. (Stilgoe et al., 2006)
	•	Despite what most people think, experts and policymakers are not the same people, and to confuse the two, as Americans often do, corrodes trust among experts, citizens, and political leaders. (Nichols, 2017)
	•	Policy-makers have to judge whether to act on a risk on the basis of scenarios that present the risks involved in acting as well as in not acting. (Rasmussen, 2006) 
	•	Policy-makers are very good at providing rationalizations to argue away awkward evidence, since they are well used to selecting evidence to argue a posi- tive case for some new policy.  (Omand, 2014)
	•	As consumers of intelligence, most policymakers rely on finished intelligence — raw information which has been processed, analyzed, and evaluated after collection. They constantly demand the best intelligence possible so they can reduce uncertainties before making decisions and implementing policy. However, there is no such thing as perfect intelligence — deception, lack of collection assets, cultural biases, and myriad other factors can taint the process prior to analysis ever occurring. (Stack, 1997)
	•	Policymakers need abbreviated, focused analytical products from the intelligence community. Even with the lengthier estimates, the intelligence community should affirm to policymakers the most likely course of events after processing and evaluating the available evidence. (Stack, 1997)
	•	Only through these types of estimates can strategic-level intelligence agencies properly "serve" the policymakers. (Stack, 1997)
	•	Policymakers must define the questions, not the answers. (CIA, 1978)
	•	Policymakers are political animals. (Petersen, 2003)
	•	all policyinakers, regardless of theft training, area of expertise, or track record, believe themselves to be excellent political analysts. (Petersen, 2003)
	•	Policymakers know they are politically savvy that is why they are in the positions they are in in the positions they are in and they have tremendous and justified confidence in their own political judgment. (Petersen, 2003)
	•	they consume vast amounts of raw intelligence the same stuff intelligence analysts are reading and they often have friends with powerful connections who share information with them hut not with the Intelligence Community. (Petersen, 2003)
	•	Policymakers may or may not question the physics that underpins the missile report or the numbers that support the economic outlook item, but they will argue politics. (Petersen, 2003)
	•	policymakers are overwheliningly people people. They think in terms of people, not history or trends. They see politics as people making deals, people maneuvering for advantage, people acting. Historical precedents and larger political, military, economic, or social forces register less than individuals. From a policy-makers perspective, France, China, Russia, etc. do not act, their counterparts in these countries act. History is made by powerful people like themselves. (Petersen, 2003)
	•	policymakers have met the people intelligence analysts write about. In many cases, they have known them for years, both in and out of power. As a result, senior officials believe that they know these people in a way that the analyst does not and cannot. It is hard to dispute this. Policymaker therefore inclined to believe that the analyst has little to offer beyond a few facts. (Petersen, 2003)
	•	policymakers believe they read all people equally well. One reason they are where they are is because they have excellent people skills. Policymakers will acknowledge the importance of culture, but they are convinced that they can see through the culture to the person. And, given some time, they believe that the can read intentions and influence the other person. especially if they have met the individual more than once. (Petersen, 2003)
	•	Policy­makers, like analysts, are "prisoners of the intelligence we collect." The more the policymaker knows about the capabilities of analysts, the more help he can get to meet the chal­lenges of his office. (Davis, 1995)
	•	Policymakers need support from intelligence to help deal with uncertainty. (Davis, 1996)
	•	the policymaker has to be the analyst of last resort in making assessments for the President and other principals. (Davis, 1996)
	•	the policymaker as assessor of foreign countries and challenges needs all the help he or she can get. (Davis, 1996)
	•	Policymakers are like surgeons. They don’t last long if they ignore what they see when they cut an issue open. (Davis, 1996)
	•	The serious policy official recognizes the power of policy bias and has a powerful incentive to do all he or she can to insure against the influence of bias and wishful thinking during the working out of analytic assumptions. (Davis, 1996)
	•	Policymakers want to succeed and cannot do so without sound assumptions. (Davis, 1996)
	•	challenges to policy assumptions have to be handled carefully. Policymakers will not gladly give up hard-fought premises; yet to succeed they cannot stick with faulty ones. (Davis, 1996)
	•	Policy-makers on the other hand are used to trying to shape the world as they would like it to be, and are resistant to being told of evidence that runs counter to that belief. (Omand, 2014)
	•	For policymakers, however, knowing the truth is a means, not an end—a means to getting the right things done. What the right things are de- pends less on what is than on what should be, less on the truth than on what should be made to become true. As pragmatists, officials know they must bound their aims within the limits of what is possible, but the ultimate aims are matters of values. (Betts, 2007)
	•	As Amos Kovacs reminds us, “Our walls are lined with books we should have read.” For policymakers especially, “attention is a scarce resource”. (Betts, 2007)
	•	Policymak- ers tend toward optimism, since whatever they do is futile or worse if desirable results are not achieved. (Betts, 2007)
	•	Policymakers tend to leave options open and hold onto their goals even if they are not achieving them, and they are comfortable juggling what analysts perceive to be incompatible aims. “The policymaker . . . avoids as long as possible the notion that he has to trade off one goal for another.” (Betts, 2007)
	•	The policymaker’s imperative is political: to make deci- sions and produce results, to act quickly and with confidence. Complexity and uncertainty impede decision, and digesting careful analysis increases the time and thought involved. (Betts, 2007)
	•	A policymaker is more likely to prefer papers that are simple, punchy, and conclusive. Attention will focus on the question “What’s the bottom line?” (Betts, 2007)
	•	Policymakers, however, are more interested in papers that are turned out fast, that offer quick responses to help them put out fires. They care about the long term and wish they had more time to think about it, but a kind of temporal Gresham’s law normally operates in decision making: immediate problems drive out distant ones. (Betts, 2007)
	•	The dominant problem for policymakers in using intel- ligence, however, remains time. (Betts, 2007)
	•	Policymakers often complain that the intelligence community does not give them the type of informa- tion they need, but they have trouble giving meaningful guidance for collection and analysis. For some purposes, moreover, it is good for the professionals to take the lead. (Betts, 2007)
	•	As Arthur Hulnick’s surveys have indicated, “Policymakers value research work . . . on the basis of brevity, timeliness and relevance in that order. Intelligence producers tend to reverse those priorities.” (Betts, 2007)
	•	In most instances, policymakers want analysis that gives them the consensus, or the best single estimate, of the intelligence community. (Betts, 2007)
	•	It's time to require national security analysts to assign numerical probabilities to their professional estimates and assessments as both a matter of rigor and of record. Policymakers can't weigh the risks associated with their decisions if they can't see how confident analysts are in the evidence and conclusions used to justify those decisions. (Schrage, 2005)
	•	Analysts and policy makers must transform fragmented and weak data into a coherent vision of the future—a task that challenges even the best minds. Their imaginations must leap, discerning a future threat where none existed in the past. (Byman, 2005)
	•	Analysts’ and policy makers’ biases and preconceptions shape how information is received and analyzed. (Byman, 2005)
	•	Like intelligence analysts, policy makers have biases and see only part of the overall picture. This limited view leads to many mistakes. (Byman, 2005)

Policy-making
	•	Policy-making is a process of successive approximation to some desired objectives in which what is desired itself continues to change under reconsideration. (Lindblom, 1959)
	•	Policy-making is a messy, sometimes chaotic, process because it needs to include social, electoral, ethical, cultural, practical, legal and economic considerations in addition to scientific evidence (Boyd, 2013)
	•	The policymaking process is particularly ill served by assessments that trivialize the challenge of uncertainty by burying honest debate in compromise language and by ignoring high-impact contingencies. (Davis, 1996)
Policy failure
	•	policy failure can lead to surprise if actions were not taken despite intelligence warnings. (Marrin, 2004)
Risk policy
	•	risk policy is a broad frame that embeds a particular risky choice in a set of similar choices. (Kahneman, 2012)
Rational risk policy
	•	Rational risk policy holds that there is only a limited amount of funding available for risk management and this should be used in the best possible way. (Löfstedt, 2005)
Policy goal
	•	Policy goals are the ends crafted not only in a political process, but also that must have political significance. (Gray, 2014)
	•	Policy ends are fuel for political strife and require political legitimation. (Gray, 2014)
	•	Policy ends are not eternal. (Gray, 2014)
	•	The policy ends selected politically today essen- tially comprise judgements, (meaning guesses) that are a mixture of value- flavoured creative endeavour, imagination, and historical education—duly encased, one hopes, in a requirement for prudence. (Gray, 2014)
Policy tools
	•	Policy tools – sometimes called instruments – are the operational devices that regulators use to achieve a protection goal. (Abelkop and Graham, 2014)
	•	They vary from programe to programe but include taxes, subsidies, marketable allowances, quotas, technology and performance standards, deposit-refund programes, registration and licensing schemes, data submission requirements, listing, labeling, insurance mandates, prohibitions, and the assignment of property and liability rights. (Abelkop and Graham, 2014)
Politic of fear
	•	The term ‘politics of fear’ contains the implications that politicians self-consciously manipulate people’s anxieties in order to realize their objectives (Furedi, 2005)
	•	[…] political elites, public figures, sections of the media and campaigners are directly culpable for using fear to promote their agenda. (Furedi, 2005)
	•	The politics of fear is rightly seen as a manipulative project that aims to immobilize public dissent. It is that, but it is also the mantra with which a disconnected elite readily responds in the circumstances of its isolation. (Furedi, 2005)
	•	[…] it absolves its practitioner from having to formulate what it actually stands for. (Furedi, 2005)
Politics
	•	Politics is a product of human nature and of the human need for order in society. (Gray, 2014)
	•	Politics basically always is about relative power; its ubiquity and persistence speak conclusively to the functional necessity for governance. (Gray, 2014)
	•	Politics determines who and what succeeds in the endless struggle for relative power, not the policy and strategy consequences of winning and losing the competition. (Gray, 2014)
	•	Politics rules, but itself can provide only a vital enablement of policy thought and deed that inherently is neutral on matters of judgement on the context of defence planning. (Gray, 2014)
	•	Politics reflect the reality that nearly always there is some room for policy choice, which means there will be room for argument. The choice may well be one entailing selection of which risks to brave and which to attempt to moderate through appeasement, but there will be some scope for choice nonetheless. (Gray, 2014)
	•	Politics is about power, meaning legitimate or other authority, and it is ‘ends’, ‘ways’, and ‘means’. (Gray, 2014)
	•	politics are devoid of substantial content about issue areas. (Gray, 2014)
	•	Politics, like strategy, is what it is. (Gray, 2014)
	•	in politics loyalty was ephemeral. (Greene, 2018)
	•	En politique, mon cher, vous le savez comme moi, il n'y a pas d'hommes, mais des idées ; pas de sentiments, mais des intérêts ; en politique, on ne tue pas un homme : on supprime un obstacle, voilà tout.  (Dumas, 1998)
Political adversary
	•	En politique, mon cher, vous le savez comme moi, il n'y a pas d'hommes, mais des idées ; pas de sentiments, mais des intérêts ; en politique, on ne tue pas un homme : on supprime un obstacle, voilà tout.  (Dumas, 1998)
Political assembly
	•	«Les assemblées politiques sont le lieu de la terre où l'éclat du génie se fait le moins sentir. On n'y tient compte que d'une éloquence appropriée au temps et au lieu, et des services rendus non à la patrie, mais aux partis. (Lebon, 1895)
Political bias
	•	political bias is the strongest predictor of attitudes towards risk (Douglas, 2005:31)
Political correctness
	•	In contemporary polemics over political correctness (see discussion in Cameron 1995), people are in effect accused of saying 'nastier things than they know' (for example if criticised for using a word like denigrate). For Trench, as for many contemporary critics of language on both the 'right' and the 'left', language is the battleground between the forces of good and bad as variously defined. (Hutton, 1998)
Political discourse
	•	Quant au contenu des discours politiques, leur analyse, comme le montre bien celle de R. Ghiglione et de ses collaborateurs (1989, p. 30 sq.), révèle la « restauration de la de la rhétorique (pour ne pas dire la sophistique). (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Et même si l’on peut dire aujourd’hui que le médiatique prime le politique, il convient de rajouter que l’un comme l’autre sont assujettis à l’impératif catégorique du spectaculaire : plaire. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	L’objectif reste la recherche systématique de l’impact qui assure aux media la fidélité de leur public. (Mannoni, 1985)
Political expert
	•	Political experts are those deemed knowledgeable about the process of governance. (Gray, 2014)
Political judgment
Human political judgement
	•	Human political judgement, individual and collective, friendly and hostile, can make a mockery of rational process with its frequent domination by all too subjectively unreasonable intent. (Gray, 2014)
Political issue
	•	When people are asked to predict the outcomes of social and political issues, their predictions tend to coincide with their preferences (Cantril, 1938; Lund, 1925; McGregor, 1938; McGuire, 1960). (Weinstein, 1980)
Political participation
Public participation
	•	participation can enhance the responsiveness and legitimacy of public institutions. (Löfstedt, 2005)
	•	Public participation levels the playing field by providing citizens with an opportunity to influence their representatives. (Löfstedt, 2005)
	•	Public/interest group participation is identified as important in rebuilding the legitimacy of the decision-making process and has prompted an expansion of university-based centres on risk communication and consultancies. (Löfstedt, 2005)
	•	For example, Webler (13) makes a strong argument that evaluation of public participation should be based on “fairness,” permitting people to participate in the interaction, initiate dialogue, challenge and defend claims; and “competence,” using the best available information. Particular emphasis is placed on “right dis- course,” which, among other characteristics, involves mul- tiway communication, consensus-based interaction, critical self-reflection, and “reasonableness”. (Chess and Purcell, 1999)
	•	participant-based goals may vary depending on culture, environmental problem, historical context, and other factors. (Chess and Purcell, 1999)
	•	Public participation has been a major topic of debate and controversy in America, Canada, and all European countries from the beginning of the 19th century. The early development of democracy in the aftermath of the American and French revolutions was characterized by the gradual integration of citizens in the political system. (Webler and Renn, 1995)
	•	Participatory democratic theorists emphasize that democratic institutions must be responsive to the social psychological character of the citizenry (Pateman 1970: 29). (Webler and Renn, 1995)
	•	Public participation is undertaken to attain the ends of system maintenance without satisfying the extraneous needs and desires of the individual participants. (Webler and Renn, 1995)
	•	Public participation is always embedded in broader social decision processes. (Vari, 1995)
	•	
Public involvement
	•	Public involvement in environmental decisions in Western democracies has continuously increased in recent decades. (Vari, 1995)
Political science
	•	Political science is the theory and practice of government and politics, which involves exploring and analysing political systems and political behaviour. The study of political science includes international relations and law, foreign policy, comparative political and studies of superpowers. At national levels political science includes civics, the notion of participation and democracy, political development, public administration and law, justice and public policy. (Winstanley, 2009)
Political scientist
	•	Political scientists have a poor reputation for forecasting, perhaps because the phenomena are difficult to measure, they rely on small populations of data, they reach for invalid correlates, or they rely on unreliable judgments (unreliability may be inherent to political science if only because the subjects are politicized). Consequently, political scientists are highly polarized between different methods. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Considered positively, a political scientist is a person who studies political phenomena scientifically. The descriptor means that political phenomena are examined on objective principles in a systemic way, for the purpose of explanation, which is the role of theory. (Gray, 2014)
Political system
	•	Political systems contain people and institutions who, by their nature (and in the character locally permissible), contend for relative power (understood as influence). (Gray, 2014)
Political risk
	•	political risk could be defined as the probability that the profitability of an investment may be negatively affected by circumstances ascribable either to adverse unforeseen changes (such as revolutions, even when linked to democratization processes, or the outbreak of tribal/ethnic conflict) in the domestic or international political arena, or to governmental policy choices affecting an international investor’s property rights (Sottilotta, 2016)
	•	political risk analysis is a first step in decision making regarding foreign investment optimalization (Sottilotta, 2016)
	•	the political phenomena taking place in a country are hardly the outcome of a pre-existing national identity but rather of the specific pattern of social relations within that country. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
Political risk analysis
	•	Political risk analysis and assessment (PRA) can be described as a practice-driven, forward-looking set of activities performed every day by a plethora of corporate and governmental actors to provide investors with insights into questions that escape the realm of conventional business risks, as they pertain instead to the magmatic and sometimes indecipherable world of sociopolitical events (Sottilotta, 2016)
Political risk analyst
	•	political risk analyst is expected not only to know thoroughly the present conditions of a given country, region or industry but also to be able to inform the decision-maker – that is, his or her client – about the possible futures that lie ahead, considering both the most and the least likely. (Sottilotta, 2016)
Political risk assessment
	•	political risk assessment focuses on problems that call for decisions concerning the implemen- tation of actions (investment), and in a way, deals with decision problems” (Sottilotta, 2016)

Political risk to foreign direct investment
	•	political risk to foreign direct investment can be defined as “the probability that political decisions, events, or conditions will significantly affect the profitability of a business actor or the expected value of a given economic action” (Matthee, 2011, p. 2010) (Sottilotta, 2016)
Political theory (risk perception)
	•	These accounts view the controversies over risk as struggles over interests, such as holding office or party advantage. The view of politics as clashing interests connects conflicts to different positions in society. The hope for explanatory power insuch approaches to risk perception is thus placed on social and demographic characteristics such as gender, age, social class, liberal conservative ratings, and/or adherence to political parties. (Wildavsky and Dake, 1990)
Political uncertainty
	•	the political phenomena taking place in a country are hardly the outcome of a pre-existing national identity but rather of the specific pattern of social relations within that country. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
	•	Les royaumes des rois sont limités, soit par des montagnes, soit par des rivières, soit par un changement de moeurs, soit par une mutation de langage. (Dumas, 1998)
Political warfare
	•	Let me begin with a short definition of political warfare, which may be described as the application of propaganda to the needs of total warfare. It seeks by special knowledge to anticipate and forestall the intentions of the enemy, to commit him to military objectives which appeal to the enemy public but which his forces cannot fulfil, to disturb the morale of the enemy public by secret broadcasting stations allegedly operated by disaffected enemy subjects inside enemy territory, and, in general, to play its part in the various schemes of deception. Described bluntly, its main purpose is to soften the way and render easier the task of the armed forces. (Lockhart, 1950)
	•	Political warfare is a term that is less well established in usage and doctrine, but one that seems useful for describing a spectrum of overt and covert activities designed to support national political-military objectives. (Lord and Barnett, 1989)
	•	[…] characterize political warfare as a general category of activities that includes political actions, coercive diplomacy, and cover political warfare, the latter corresponding roughly to the covert aspect of what the Soviets refer to as “activates measures” […] (Lord and Barnett, 1989)
	•	[…] political warfare is “the forceful political expression of policy,” (Lord and Barnett, 1989)
	•	Political warfare may be overt or covert, but it must provide foreigners true and convincing reasons why they should identify themselves and their cause with the United States (Lord and Barnett, 1989)
Politician
	•	A politician or public figure whom we see as more authentic than others is generally better at projecting such a quality. They know that appearing humble, or discussing their private life, or telling an anecdote that reveals some vulnerability will have the “authentic” effect. We are not seeing them as they are in the privacy of their home. Life in the public sphere means wearing a mask, and sometimes some people wear the mask of “authenticity.” (Greene, 2018)
	•	we tend to believe that someone who adheres to a particular religion or political belief system or moral code must have the character to go with this. But people bring the character they have to the position they occupy or to the religion they practice. A person can be a progressive liberal or a loving Christian and still be an intolerant tyrant at heart. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Politicians are masters at stirring up and exploiting our discontent with present circumstances, but they have no sense of how to spark our imagination about the future. (Greene, 2018)
	•	The politician can tell what to emphasize to his audience, but the ability to estimate group reactions on a large scale over a wide geographic and psychological area is a specialized ability which must be developed with the same painstaking self-criticism and with the same dependence on experience that are required for the development of the clinical sense in the doctor or the surgeon. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)

Politicize
	•	The strict definition of politicize is not ipso facto pejorative. It is “to give a political tone or character” or “to bring within the realm of poli- tics.” And policy—which is, after all, where intelligence is used—is squarely in the realm of politics. (Betts, 2007)
Politicization
	•	Politicization means to make an issue appear to be open, a matter of choice, something that is decided upon and that therefore entails responsibility, in contrast to issues that either could not be different (laws of nature) or should not be put under political control (e.g., a free economy, the private sphere, and matters forexpert decision). (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	Politicization can manifest itself in many ways, but in each case it boils down to the same essential elements: "Almost all agree that it involves deliberately distorting analysis or judgments to favor a preferred line of thinking irrespective of evidence. Most consider 'classic' politicization to be only that which occurs if products are forced to conform to policy-makers' views. A number believe politicization also results from management pressures to drive certain lines of analysis and substantive view-points. Still others believe that changes in tone or emphasis made during the normal coordinations process, and limited means for expressing alternative viewpoints, also constitute forms of politicization." (Gates, 1992)
	•	The issue of politicisation has dogged American intelligence for years and reflects the fact that although we belong to an institution with established norms and procedures, we are all human and prone to make mistakes and errors in judgment. (Gates, 1992)
	•	Politicization is a fighting word, usually invoked as a charge of simple bad faith. In reality, however, it is a complicated phenomenon, which in a few limited respects offers benefits as well as costs. It can be bad or good, and it can flow down or up. (Betts, 2007)
	•	The popular conception of the term focuses only on the bad form and the top-down direction. (Betts, 2007)
	•	Politicization is bad when it suppresses or distorts the truth to promote a political agenda; it can be good when it does not misrepresent but packages information in a way that prevents it from being shunted aside as irrelevant. (Betts, 2007)
	•	It can be exerted from the top down if officials try to make intelligence conform to policy. It can also flow from the bottom up if professionals imbue analysis with their own political biases. (Betts, 2007)
	•	The roots of controversy over politicization lie deep within the contradictions between the dynamics of the analytical process and the decision process, of professional norms and political utility, and of the qualities required for accuracy in analysis and for influence on policy. (Betts, 2007)
	•	Depending on the definition of the term, however, politicization is to some degree inevitable and in some forms necessary. To deal with the problem it is first necessary to consider the term afresh, without the pejorative presumption. (Betts, 2007)
	•	Most of what is seen as illegitimate politicization is only the reflection of what is considered normal controversy in other arenas. It is seen as evil because of the sacred norm that intelligence judgments be more objective, nonpartisan, and scientific than other judgments. (Betts, 2007)
	•	The prevalent conception behind the pejorative connotation is that politicization fabricates or distorts information to serve policy preferences or vested interests. This view covers a multitude of sins, some blatant and crude, some subtle and artful. (Betts, 2007)
	•	Such corruption can be deliberate or unconscious and can happen when operators intent on making a policy work put pressure on intelligence producers to state conclusions that confirm the validity of the policy, or when analysts manipulate information to undermine a policy of which they disapprove. (Betts, 2007)
	•	A more forgiving view is that politicization is not simply a malign choice or intellectually sloppy but a nearly unavoidable condition. (Betts, 2007)
	•	For issues of high import and controversy, any relevant analysis will per- force be politically charged because it will point at least implicitly to a conclusion about policy—whether it will work, whether it addresses the right issue, whether it will have negative side effects, and so on. Various disputes—which elements of information are correct, ambigu- ous, or false; which are important, incidental, or irrelevant; in which context they should be understood and against which varieties of in- formation pointing in a different direction they should be assessed—are in effect, if not intent, disputes about which policy judgment stands or falls. (Betts, 2007)
	•	The prevalent concept is that politicization is the top-down dictation of analytical conclusions to support preferred policy. This view dominates discussion of the problem, but examples are seldom seen in stark form. (Betts, 2007)
	•	The more forgiving view sees politicization as a subtle contamination of analysis by policy predispositions. This concept is manifested far more frequently, but there is no consensus about what should be done to cope with it. (Betts, 2007)
	•	Politicization in either sense exists in the eye of the beholder whose political preferences are inconsistent with the implications of the analysis. (Betts, 2007)

Top-down politicization
	•	The form of politicization that evokes the most direct protests is the top-down variety, whereby policymakers dictate intelligence conclusions. (Betts, 2007)
Botton-up politicization
	•	The reverse form—bottom-up coloration of products by the biases of the working analysts who produce intelligence—is frequently charged by the policymakers. (Betts, 2007)
	•	Politicization can operate unconsciously from the bottom up if analysts let their own policy biases contaminate their writing. (Betts, 2007)

Bidirectional politicization
	•	A variation between these two forms is one that operates in both directions, mediating between the contrasting mind-sets of policymakers and analysts. This involves the shaping of intelligence products by analysts’ managers in their capacity as editors or institutional brokers and in ways that original drafters sometimes consider inconsistent with evidence and motivated by policy concerns. If done properly, managers’ editing should be the benign form of politicization, bringing intelligence “within the realm of politics” without corrupting it. (Betts, 2007)
	•	Heavy editorial management, however, is easily seen by working analysts as pandering. Accusations of politicization flow when unconscious bot- tom-up bias and bias in editorial management collide. (Betts, 2007)
Politicization of intelligence
	•	the relationship risks politicization, which is the manipulation of intelligence data and assessments to support policy. (Marrin, 2004)
	•	Theoretically, obtaining both the objectivity and accuracy inherent in intelligence that is outside the chain of command and the relevancy derived from a close policy support should be possible. (Marrin, 2004)
	•	The problem of politicization is as old as old as the intlligence business. (Gates, 1992)
	•	I believe the first line of defense against politicisation and analytic distortions is our own integrity. (Gates, 1992)
	•	Perceptions of politicization or other kinds of intentional distortion tend to arise in the absence of an open, creative environment that encourages give-and-take. (Gates, 1992)
	•	Also, unwarranted concerns about politicization can arise when analysts themselves fail to understand their role in the process. We do produce a corporate product. If the policymaker wants the opinion of a single individual, he or she can (and frequently does) consult any one of a dozen outside experts on any given issue. Your work, on the other hand, counts because it represents the well-considered view of an entire directorate and, in the case of of National Estimates, the entire Intelligence Community. Analysts themselves must play a critical role in making the system work. They must do their part to help foster an open environment. Analysts must understand and practice the corporate concept. They must discard the academic mindset that says their work is their own, and they must take into account the views of others during the coordination process. (Gates, 1992)
	•	Accountability requires that analysts and managers  understand each other's viewpoints and work together in producing the best analysis they can. (Gates, 1992)
	•	In its examination of politicization, the task force concluded that "the solution to the problem of politicization, broadly defined, is not so much a matter of mechanisms as it is confidence in the integrity and capabilities of our people. For our recommendations to yield positive results, every Agency employee from the DCI on down must demonstrate adherence to the principles of integrity on which objective analysis rests, and civility, which fosters a trusting, creative environment." (Gates, 1992)
	•	In the end, preventing distortion of our analysis depends on where all of us draw the line day in and day out. We must draw a line:• Between producing a corporate product and supressing different views.• Between adjusting stylistic presentation to anticipate your consumer's predilections and changing the analysis to pander to them.• Between making order out of chaos and suppressing legitimate debate.• Between viewing reporting critically and using evidence selectively.• Between avoiding wishy-washiness and pretending to be more certain than we are.• Between being a team player and being a careerist• Between maintaining efficiency and and suppressing legitimate debate.• Between providing leadership and fostering a fearful, oppressive climate. (Gates, 1992)
	•	Policymakers are often dissatisfied with what they get from intelligence analysts, while analysts are frustrated when what they produce is apparently misused or not used at all. Conflicting constraints and incentives shape the work of people in both groups. When tension emerges, the issue of politicization is close behind. (Betts, 2007)
	•	If intelligence managers bear primary responsibility for making their products useful or even used, however, their vulnerability to charges of politicization increases. (Betts, 2007)
	•	Everyone knows politicization is bad. It is assumed to damage the credibility of intelligence. Some believe that it is not much of a problem, but virtually no one believes it is a good thing. For the most part this view is correct—especially when we think only in terms of the popular understanding of the concept. (Betts, 2007)
	•	Depending on the definition of the term, however, politicization is to some degree inevitable and in some forms necessary. To deal with the problem it is first necessary to consider the term afresh, without the pejorative presumption. (Betts, 2007)
	•	The real world of policy makes politicization in one form the worst thing that can happen to intelligence; in another form, however, it is the best. The pejorative presumption obscures this point and makes navigating away from the worst and toward the best forms more difficult. (Betts, 2007)
	•	The prevalent conception behind the pejorative connotation is that politicization fabricates or distorts information to serve policy preferences or vested interests. This view covers a multitude of sins, some blatant and crude, some subtle and artful. (Betts, 2007)
	•	Such corruption can be deliberate or unconscious and can happen when operators intent on making a policy work put pressure on intelligence producers to state conclusions that confirm the validity of the policy, or when analysts manipulate information to undermine a policy of which they disapprove. (Betts, 2007)
	•	In one sense, intelligence cannot live with politicization but, in another, policy cannot live without it. The more intelligence matters, the more politicized it will appear to some faction in a policy debate. Grappling with the problem is frustrated by the unwillingness of anyone, on any side of the debate, to admit that their own approach might be politicized. (Betts, 2007)
	•	The irrevocable norm must be that policy interests, preferences, or decisions must never determine intelligence judgments. (Betts, 2007)
	•	Analysts’ awareness of the complexity of the issues they deal with makes them sensitive to the reasons policies will not work. Analysts who complicate and equivocate do not compete as effectively for the limited attention of consumers as those who simplify and advocate— but the latter politicize their product more egregiously. (Betts, 2007)
	•	One frequent complaint of politicization by policymakers was that administration spokesmen often used intelligence selectively in public arguments, “cherry-picking” bits and pieces that supported the case for war against Iraq and not revealing contradictory information or the fact that most intelligence professionals disagreed with the interpretation. (Betts, 2007)
	•	if politicians use intelligence selectively but deny professionals the right to reveal contradictory interpretations, the politicians’ arguments benefit deceptively by bearing the imprimatur of intelligence. This can happen when officials at the highest level declassify pieces of information informally, while professionals cannot. (Betts, 2007)
	•	selective attention to congenial information can become egregious. (Betts, 2007)
	•	If political leaders believe that intelligence is politicized from below, activism to push different questions, assumptions, and approaches to assessment onto the professional agenda is legitimate. Challenging mind-sets should be a two-way street. (Betts, 2007)
	•	The challenge remains to make intelligence relevant without making it dishonest by pulling punches in a way that lets policymakers believe what they want. In practical terms, if intelligence is to be useful, its politicization will be a continuum from more to less, with the least being the aim for which professionals strive, zero being unattainable without denuding an analysis of all connection with political reality. (Betts, 2007)
	•	Minimal contamination by political bias, or open and balanced competition be- tween analysis from different predispositions, must be the norm, but enforcing it may generate just as many charges of politicization as it averts. Much depends on the artful straddling of thin lines by intelligence managers—something not easily done—or on signals sent in the choice of managers. (Betts, 2007)
	•	In turning intelligence disputes into public controversies, intelligence may be damaged, but policy may be served by forc- ing important issues onto the table. (Betts, 2007)
	•	The organizational pluralism of the in- telligence community is the best defense against deceptive and damaging politicization, and that defense may best be provided by unmasking and setting up a competition between predispositions, rather than letting biases sneak into products striving for ideal objectivity. (Betts, 2007)
	•	All contamination of analysis by policy predispositions will never be fully purged from the process. Every analyst’s ideas and assumptions, and those of managers or competing analysts, will be politicizing forces, however muted or constrained professional standards of rigor may make them. Analysis that remains trenchant, rather than descen ing into negotiated mush, will never be politically neutral. (Betts, 2007)
Manipulative politicization
	•	When manipulative politicization is deliberate it is sinful, but it is usually motivated by the best of intentions—to serve what is seen as a good higher than intellectual probity. When it is unconscious it is more innocent but also more insidious because it is harder to pin down and expose. (Betts, 2007)

Pollution
	•	Pollution of the air, water, and land has long been recognized as a problem, but efforts at pollution control have been highly sporadic. (Covello and Mumpower, 1986)
	•	Pollution, for example, is the price we pay for progress. Even pollution levels can be reduced. (Coker, 2009)

Air pollution
	•	Air pollution (due to dust and smoke from wood and coal fires) has been a ubiquitous problem in congested urban areas since ancient times. (Covello and Mumpower, 1986)
Popullation dynamic
	•	As more species are taken into account, the population dynamics can become more and more complicated. This is why a more appropriate description than ‘foodchains’ for ecosystems is the term foodwebs (Figure 5). These are networks in which nodes are species and links represent relations of predation. Links are usually directed (big fishes eat smaller ones, not the other way round). These networks provide the interchange of food, energy, and matter between species, and thus constitute the circulatory system of the biosphere. They are the blood vessels of the Earth. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
Polysemy
	•	Polysemy is created when an old form is used to designate a new idea; it remains in synchrony as a trace of linguistic change. The notion of polysemy (ibid.) also demonstrates Bréal's belief in the progress of language, thought and society. Polysemy is an indicator of intellectual and social progress. It also makes it clear that meaning is not subordinated to form, but that meaning is indeed the real force in language evolution. Polysemy shows, like no other process of semantic change, the accumulated victories of mind over matter. (Hutton, 1998)
Popperian doctrine
	•	To sum up this part of the Popperian doctrine: Research starts with a problem. The problem is the result of a conflict between an expectation and an observation which in turn is constituted by the expectation. (Feyerabend, 1993)
	•	the ideas of the Popperian school were obtained by generalizing solutions for methodological and episte- mological problems. (Feyerabend, 1993)
Popularity is attractive principle
	•	Sociologists have found evidence of indirect mate choice in which people choose their partner not only on the basis of that individual’s personal features, but taking into account as well other people’s opinion. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
	•	For example, a study found that college-age women tend to rate higher a man in a picture where he is surrounded by many other women than the same man photographed alone. A long list of previous partnerships may put a person in a good position to attract even more partners. This is why preferential attachment is also called the popularity is attractive principle. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
Portfolio of force
	•	Portfolio force structures are thus always a compromise, and different from any force structure optimized to deal with only one of the individual risksthat need to be addressed. (Frühling, 2014)
	•	A portfolio organization is usually a trait of a force structure as a whole, when it is designed to be able to generate force packages suited for a number of different, distinct contingencies. (Frühling, 2014)
	•	At the platform level, a portfolio approach would lead to a consistent emphasis on multi-role capable systems, if the portfolio relies on the same forces to operate in several different potential conflicts. (Frühling, 2014)
Portfolio of investments
	•	The basic picture is that defense planners should think of themselves as investing in several classes of activity. Balancing those investments (i.e., balancing the portfolio) requires a mixture of analysis and judgment; decisions on how to do so should be revisited regularly. (Davis, 2000)
	•	This approach stresses operational adaptiveness (first branch), strategic adaptiveness (third branch), and environment shaping (second branch) rather than the myth of one-time decisions, much less one-time optimal decisions. (Davis, 2000)
	•	In the financial context, portfolio theory explains how investors can manage uncertainty regarding future pricesof various assets: If an investor holds a diversified portfolio of several assets, the expected return of the portfolio is the (weighted) average of the component stocks. (Frühling, 2014)
	•	But for a given expected return, the variance of the portfolio return is less than the weighted average of the individual variances. (Frühling, 2014)
	•	Under additional assumptions, a portfolio is thus the optimum solution to a problem in which an investor is confronted with several independent risks, but information is available to assess these risks with relatively high confidence. (Frühling, 2014)
	•	The essence of a portfolio is that it can manage a number of specific risks at the same time. It consists of anumber of assets that all contribute to the reduction of each individual risk – through the covariance between asset prices in the financial example, or because any military system will usually have at least some usefulness in military operations of any kind. (Frühling, 2014)
Positivism
	•	positivism can be described as the ‘received view’ (Hacking, 1981) – that is, a transcultural, cumulative theory of knowledge according to which the reality is a ‘given’ which indeed can be known through empirical experience allowing for scientific generalizations (Sottilotta, 2016)
Positive test strategy
	•	A deliberate search for confirming evidence, known as positive test strategy, is also how System 2 tests a hypothesis. Contrary to the rules of philosophers of science, who advise testing hypotheses by trying to refute them, people (and scientists, quite often) seek data that are likely to be compatible with the beliefs they currently hold. (Kahneman, 2012)
Post-industrial society
	•	A post-industrial society is based on services. Life becomes a game between persons. What counts is not raw muscle power, or energy; what counts is information. (Bell, 1976)
	•	Central to the post-industrial society is the fact that the sources of innovation are the codifications of theoretical knowledge. (Bell, 1976)
Postmodernism
	•	postmodernist movement debuting in the 1960s, inevitably leads to “the point where knowledge becomes a closed system, a language game” (Morçöl, 2001, p. 105) (Sottilotta, 2016)
Post-modern age
	•	The post-modern age has been defined as ‘a more modest modernity’ (Lipton 1999:11), a time when modernity is coming to terms with its own limits. It has been forced to recognize the global consequences of its own initiatives and projects. (Coker, 2009)
Post-modern society
	•	Post-modern society is in this sense characterized by a focus on modernity itself, or, more specifically, by a focus on technology and economic development: on its management, control, unwanted side-effects, and general trustworthiness. (Boholm, 1996)
Postmortem
	•	Post mortem inquiries often reveal poor information handling processes, but it does not follow that these were responsible for the intelligence failures. (Omand, 2014)
Post-trust society
	•	Risk Management in Post-Trust Societies joins the increasing number of efforts adding to the systematic empirical-based understanding of trust. (Cvetkovich, 2005)
	•	Our efforts to understand post-trust risk management should explicitly define concepts and empirically test those conceptualizations. (Cvetkovich, 2005)
Potency value
	•	Potency values are established by EPA (or state health agencies) to reflect the relative toxicity of carcinogenic substances. (Williams and Paustenbach, 2002)
Power
	•	Power began to be defined in terms of energy and the speed which it promoted. (Coker, 2009)
	•	Energy was transformed into force: the translation of political energy (or ideas, such as revolution, nationalism and state power) into overwhelming force at a precise point of impact. Energy subsequently became the central concept of war. (Coker, 2009)
	•	Power without knowledge is useless at best, dangerous at worst. (Betts, 2007)
	•	analysts must understand the three key elements of power, which are culture bound: how power is acquired, the preferred means of wielding power, and the acceptable and unacceptable uses of power. (Petersen, 2003)
	•	Use the appropriate dominance cues to make people think you are powerful, even before you reach the heights. You want to seem like you were destined for success, a mystical effect that always works. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Knowing your environment better will present many opportunities for power. (Greene, 2018)
Power desire
	•	This desire for power is not evil or antisocial; it is a natural response to the awareness of our essential weakness and vulnerability. In essence, what drives much of our behavior is to have control over circumstances, to feel the connection between what we do and what we get—to feel that we can influence people and events to some extent. This mitigates our sense of helplessness and makes the unpredictability of life tolerable. (Greene, 2018)
	•	
Social power
	•	This relationship among subjects is not equal or symmetrical, and the possibility for successful securitization will vary dramatically with the positionheld by the actor. Security is thus very much a structured field in whichsome actors are placed in positions of power by virtue of being generallyaccepted voices of security, by having the power to define security (Bigo1994, 1996, forthcoming). This power, however, is never absolute: No oneis guaranteed the ability to make people accept a claim for necessary secrity action (as even the Communist elites of Eastern Europe learned; seeWaver 1995b), nor is anyone excluded from attempts to articulate alterna-tive interpretations of security. The field is structured or biased, but no oneconclusively "holds" the power of securitization. (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	Use the appropriate dominance cues to make people think you are powerful, even before you reach the heights. You want to seem like you were destined for success, a mystical effect that always works. (Greene, 2018)
	•	On the way to gaining power, people will tend to play the courtier, to seem deferential, to follow the party line, to do what it takes to make it to the top. Once at the top, there are fewer restraints and they will often reveal something about themselves you had not noticed before. Some people stay true to the values they had before attaining a high position—they remain respectful and empathetic. On the other hand, far more people suddenly feel entitled to treat others differently now that they have the power. (Greene, 2018)
	•	you need to take notice of what people reveal once they are in power. So often we think that power has changed people, when in fact it simply reveals more of who they are. (Greene, 2018)
Intuitive power
	•	Intuitive powers at the mastery level are a mix of the instinctive and the rational, the conscious and the unconscious, the human and the animal. It is our way of making sudden and powerful connections to the environment, to feeling or thinking inside things. (Greene, 2014)
Cultural power
	•	What you are doing is creating some space in a cluttered culture, claiming for yourself an open field in which you can finally plant something new. People are dying for the new, for what expresses the spirit of the time in an original way. By creating something new you will create your own audience, and attain the ultimate position of power in culture. (Greene, 2014)
Curse of power
	•	We have come to take such powers for granted and expect everything in life to be so fast and easy.Whatever the cause, it infects all of us, and we must see this sense of entitlement as a curse. It makes us ignore the reality—people have noinherent reason to trust or respect us just because of who we are. It makes us lazy and contented with the slightest idea or the first draft of our work. Why do we have to raise our game or strain to improve ourselves when we feel we are already so great? It makes us insensitive and self-absorbed. By feeling that others owe us trust and respect, we negate their willpower, their ability to judge for themselves, and this is infuriating. We may not see it, but we inspire resentment. And if we become leaders or subleaders, the effect of this curse only gets worse. Unconsciously, we tend to sit back and expect people to come to us with their loyalty and respect for the high position we occupy. We grow defensive and prickly if our ideas are challenged, putting our intelligence and wisdom into question, even on the smallest of matters. We expect certain perks and privileges, and if there are sacrifices to be made, we somehow feel we should be exempted. If we make a mistake, it is always the fault of someone else, or circumstances, or some momentary inner demon beyond our control. We are never really to blame. (Greene, 2018)
	•	We are not aware of how this affects those whom we lead, because we notice only people’s smiles and nods of approval at what we say. But they see through us. They feel the entitlement we project, and over time it diminishes their respect and disconnects them from our influence. At a certain tipping point, they may turn against us with a suddenness that is shocking. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Like Elizabeth, we must realize that we are actually in a weak position, and we must struggle to adopt the opposite attitude: We expect nothing from the people around us, from those whom we lead. We are not defensive or sitting back but completely active—everything we get from others, and most definitely their respect, must be earned. We have to continually prove ourselves. We have to show that our primary consideration is not ourselves and our sensitive egos but the welfare of the group. We must be responsive and truly empathetic to people’s moods, but with limits—to those who show themselves to be mostly self-promoting, we are tough and merciless. We practice what we preach, working harder than others, sacrificing our own interests if necessary, and being accountable for any mistakes. We expect the members of the group to follow our lead and prove themselves in return. (Greene, 2018)
	•	With such an attitude, we will notice a very different effect. People will open themselves to our influence; as we move toward them, they move toward us. They want to win our approval and respect. With such an emotional connection, we are more easily forgiven for mistakes. The group energy is not squandered on endless infighting and the clashing of egos but is directed toward reaching goals and accomplishing great things. And in achieving such results, we can forge an aura of authority and power that only grows with time. What we say and do seems to carry extra weight, and our reputation precedes us. (Greene, 2018)
Power outage
Large-scale power outages 
	•	Large-scale power outages reveal the connectedness of power grids. These systems deliver electricity across large distances from central points to cities and industrial areas. Carefully planned in the beginning, they grow more and more intricate over time. Nowadays, generators, transformers, and substations, connected by high-voltage transmission lines, constitute a network that spans several regions and often several countries (as the 2003 example shows). It is clear that such networks require careful maintenance to prevent criticalities. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
Powerful individual
	•	Individuals who are powerful (through position, expertise or some other route) are more likely to be able to retain their own personal representations and to be able to influence the development of social representations shared by others. (Breakwell, 2014)
	•	On the way to gaining power, people will tend to play the courtier, to seem deferential, to follow the party line, to do what it takes to make it to the top. Once at the top, there are fewer restraints and they will often reveal something about themselves you had not noticed before. Some people stay true to the values they had before attaining a high position—they remain respectful and empathetic. On the other hand, far more people suddenly feel entitled to treat others differently now that they have the power. (Greene, 2018)
	•	you need to take notice of what people reveal once they are in power. So often we think that power has changed people, when in fact it simply reveals more of who they are. (Greene, 2018)
Practice
	•	concentrated practice over time cannot fail but produce results. (Greene, 2014)
Pragmatism
	•	Being realistic and pragmatic is what makes us humans so powerful. It is how we overcame our physical weakness in a hostile environment so many thousands of years ago, and learned to work with others and form powerful communities and tools for survival. Although we have veered away from this pragmatism, as we no longer have to rely on our wits to survive, it is in fact our true nature as the preeminent social animal on the planet. In becoming more realistic, you are simply becoming more human. (Greene, 2018)
Prayer
	•	pour l'homme heureux, la prière demeure un assemblage monotone et vide de sens, jusqu'au jour où la douleur vient expliquer à l'infortuné ce langage sublime à l'aide duquel il parle à Dieu. (Dumas, 1998)
Precautionary principle
	•	the "precautionary principle" is based in large part on societal preferences for future environmental protection and safety in situations where very little is known about a chemical or agent. (Williams and Paustenbach, 2002)
	•	The precautionary principle movement began in Europe in the early 1990s, in which the view was adopted that it would be prudent to work toward the elimination of environmental releases at any measurable quantity of non-naturally occurring substances. Over the past 5- 10 years, no single definition for this principle has been accepted by all of the various governmental and non-governmental bodies that are interested in this topic. (Williams and Paustenbach, 2002)
	•	the most widely cited definitions, which embodies the central elements, is as follows (Rachel's Hazardous Waste News, 1993): The precautionary principle says that to avoid irreparable harm to the environment and to human health, precautionary action should be taken: Where it is acknowledged that a practice tor substance) could cause harm, even without conclusive scientific proof that it has caused harm or does cause harm. the practice (or emissions of the substance) should be prevented and eliminated. (Williams and Paustenbach, 2002)
	•	[…] the precautionary principle contains several views that many risk analysts find troublesome. First, there is no provision for a risk/risk tradeoff. Second. irrespective of the possible benefits to society, no amount of emissions are deemed acceptable. Third, it is inferred that whomever is promoting a technology that might emit some level of toxicants cannot be expected to be objective in their analysis of the possible risks. (Williams and Paustenbach, 2002)
	•	Critics of the precautionary principle have noted that if adopted, the role of science in the decision making process will be minimized, if not eliminated (Williams and Paustenbach, 2002)
	•	The Principle should be rejected, wrote Sunstein, "not because it leads in bad directions, but because it leads in no direction at all. The principle is literally paralyzing -forbidding inaction, stringent regulation, and every- thing in between." (Sachs, 2011)
	•	"The most serious problem with the strong version of the precautionary principle is that it offers no guidance-not that it is wrong, but that it forbids all courses of action, including inaction." (Sachs, 2011)
	•	Precaution in risk regulation is controversial, in part, because of alack of consensus on what precaution means. (Sachs, 2011)
	•	concept of precaution, from the simplistic "better safe than sorry" to complicated, multipart definitions. (Sachs, 2011)
	•	Precautionary measures (such as bans, restrictions, or labeling and/or warn- ing requirements) can be expensive and complex to implement, and they should not be invoked for trivial dangers, or for activities where there is no credible evidence of a risk. (Sachs, 2011)
	•	the Principle establishes a "stop and think" mechanism under which the risk creator bears the burden both to quantify the risk and to disclose relevant risk data to regulators (such as accident probabilities, toxicity data, health studies, dispersal projections for release of toxic materials, etc.). (Sachs, 2011)
	•	the Principle can be compared to other, nonconstitutional principles that have provided loose guidance to successive administrations, such as the containment doctrine during the Cold War. (Sachs, 2011)
	•	Procedurally, the Principle acts as an information-forcing device. It provides a profit motive for firms to undertake research on the health and environmental risks of their own products and activities. Bearing the burden of proof, firms will have a keen interest in developing the risk assessment data that will facilitate approval by government regulators (consider the investment that drug manufacturers make in clinical trials and in New Drug Applications to the Food and Drug Administration). The Principle flips the perverse incentives that occur under a regulatory regime with a governmental burden of proof, in which regulated firms stand to gain by not developing, or by obfuscating, important risk as- sessment data. (Sachs, 2011)
	•	the Principle reminds both the regulator and the regulated party that risk regulatory decisions carry "distinctive moral weight and responsibility. (Sachs, 2011)
	•	Statutes grounded in Strong Precaution raise the possibility of regulation that is "too early" or that aggressively responds to risks that may later turn out to be less severe than initially believed. But some default decision rule must be chosen, and we should not dis- miss the default presumptions of Strong Precaution out of hand. The most pressing question, rather, is deciding which default decision rules make sense in particular areas of law. (Sachs, 2011)
	•	The Principle is contextual and pragmatic. It allows policy makers to assess the seriousness of risks and to develop appropriate responses in a much more qualitative way than staunch advocates of a cost-benefit test would tolerate. (Sachs, 2011)
	•	the Precautionary Principle helps us choose among alternative regulatory actions (including no action) by countering the cognitive tendency to avoid decisions that involve upfront costs and more distant benefits. (Sachs, 2011)
	•	the Precautionary Principle still plays a useful role by ruling out arguments that all decisions should be postponed due to scientific uncertainty. (Sachs, 2011)
	•	The Precautionary Principle, according to Kysar, approaches complex tradeoffs through deliberation, moral reflection, and appreciation of the limits of human cognition. (Sachs, 2011)
	•	The Principle should be viewed primarily as a framework to guide legislators, rather than a framework to guide regulators, because, at least in U.S. law, the shift in the burden of proof usually requires some legislative authorization. (Sachs, 2011)
	•	The simplest interpretation of the precautionary principle is that “it is better to be safe than sorry.” But the principle comes in many diverse forms, ranging from weak to strong. (Sunstein, 2005)
	•	the precautionary principle often seems motivated by this form of selectivity—favoring the kind of risks that cause tragedies that make headlines, while ignoring the kind that show up only asa result of statistical analysis. (Sunstein, 2005)
	•	The precautionary principle does not provide guidance on how much to regulate; it does not easily allow for weighing the variables that are at stake. (Sunstein, 2005)
	•	the precautionary principle can be paralyzing, providing no direction at all. Balancing costs against benefits ought not to be understood as a way of placing regulators into an arithmetic straightjacket. But it does offer the foundation of a principled approach for making difficult decisions. (Sunstein, 2005)
	•	the precautionary principle describes the philosophy that should be adopted for addressing hazards subject to high scientific uncertainty, and rules out lack of scientific certainty as a reason for not taking preventive action. Although originally formulated in the context of environmental protection, particularly in connection with ‘global’ environmental issues (eg climate change, ozone depletion), the precautionary principle has been applied more widely. (Great Britain and Health and Safety Executive, 2001)
	•	Our policy is that the precautionary principle should be invoked where: there is good reason, based on empirical evidence or plausible causal hypothesis, tobelieve that serious harm might occur, even if the likelihood of harm is remote; and the scientific information gathered at this stage of consequences and likelihood reveals such uncertainty that it is impossible to evaluate the conjectured outcomes with sufficient confidence to move to the next stages of the risk assessment process. (Great Britain and Health and Safety Executive, 2001)
	•	Though the precautionary principle is invoked for hazards where, because of the uncertainty involved, it is not possible to apply the conventional techniques of risk assessment to assess the risks involved whatever the circumstances, it is possible in practice, to use such techniques for operationalising the principle. Uncertainty is overcome by constructing credible scenarios on how the hazards could be realised and thereby making assumptions about consequences and likelihood. The credible scenarios can range from a ‘most likely’ worst case to a ‘worst case possible’ depending on the degree of uncertainty. (Great Britain and Health and Safety Executive, 2001)
	•	Though such risk assessments made on scenarios are inevitably narrower in scope than a full blown risk assessment, this may not be a serious limitation if the scenarios are carefully chosen to reflect what could happen in reality. (Great Britain and Health and Safety Executive, 2001)
	•	We would argue that the management of risks characterized by multiple and high uncertainties should be guided by the precautionary approach. (Renn, 2007b)
	•	The precautionary principle – which is incorpo- rated in much of the ENVI-legislation today – builds on this very acknowledgement that uncertainty is the general condition. (Jørgensen, 2011)
	•	Precaution and substitution are principles that offer some insight for regulators (just as cost-benefit and risk-risk comparison can offer insight); but they are not operational policy tools that regulators can deploy. (Abelkop and Graham, 2014)
	•	The cautionary principle is a basic principle in risk and safety management, expressing that, if the consequences of an activity could be serious and subject to uncertainties, then cautionary measures should be taken or the activity should not be carried out (Aven and Vinnem 2007; HSE 2001). (Aven, 2014)
	•	Although the precautionary principle can be described as expressing a form of cautiousness, it should not be equated with cautiousness in general. (Swedish Chemicals Agency et al., 2007)
	•	First, this is a principle that requires us to be cautious, risk-averse, and on the safe side with respect to possible dangers. Secondly, it requires that we take action even in the absence of full scientific evidence. (Swedish Chemicals Agency et al., 2007)
	•	In accordance with this tradition, we take the precautionary principle to be a principle for decision-making under scientific uncertainty. Since it concerns the relationship between scientific knowledge and regulatory decision-making, it is best understood against the background of an account of the scientific knowledge process and how it can be adjusted to the needs of practical decision-making. (Swedish Chemicals Agency et al., 2007)
	•	The precautionary principle thus interpreted, is not synonymous with the substitution principle.
	•	concerns the criteria for when to take protective action. (Swedish Chemicals Agency et al., 2007)
	•	Whereas standard risk analysis disregards metadoxastic uncertainty, the precautionary principle urges us to focus on it and let it influence decision-making. (Swedish Chemicals Agency et al., 2007)
	•	In the risk-averse world, one regulatory philosophy that has become increasingly fashionable is that of the precautionary principle. (Lofstedt, 2004)
	•	If the use of the precautionary principle is to remain a credible regulatory tool, then it needs to be used within the parameters set out by the European Commission's communication, as its misuse will lead to public and stakeholder distrust of European regulators and worse policymaking overall. (Lofstedt, 2004)
	•	The precautionary principle stresses the importance of prudence in cases of scientific uncertainty (Klinke etal., 2006). (Sjöberg, 2008)
	•	The precautionary principle (or rejection thereof) arguably is the ultimate reflection of the promotion of risk to a societal value. (van Calster, 2008)
	•	The precautionary principle was adopted in international environment law in 1992 on the grounds that ‘the absence of scientific proof of cause−effect relationship . . . should not be used to justify inaction.’ (Coker, 2009)
	•	Anticipatory self-defence was its official legal justification for attacking Afghanistan in 2001. The political reshaping of societies most at risk of fostering terrorism is deemed by some to be a sensible precautionary measure. (Coker, 2009)
	•	the precautionary principle was bound to be highly divisive. (Coker, 2009)
	•	on évoque le principe de précaution, en complément de la prévention, lorsque l’on connaît mal un risque voire lorsqu’on connaît mal son existence, dans l’état des connaissances scientifiques actuelles, et ses dangers de matérialisation. (Dumont, 2011)
Risk problems due to interpretative and normative ambiguity
	•	If risk information is interpreted differently by different stakeholders in society – in other words there are different viewpoints about the relevance, meaning and implications of factual explanations and predictions for deciding about the tolerability of a risk as well as management actions – and if the values and priorities of what should be protected or reduced are subject to intense controversy, risk management needs to address the causes for these conflicting views (von Winterfeldt and Edwards, 1984). (Renn, 2007b)
Strong Precautionary Principle
	•	The Strong Precautionary Principle shifts the burden of proof on the safety of a product or activity from government regulators to private firms. I define it as the view that: (1) regulation should presumptively be applied when an activity or product poses serious threats to human health or the environment, even if scientific uncertainty precludes a full understanding of the nature or extent of the threats; and (2) the burden of overcoming the presumption in favor of regulation lies with the proponent of the risk-creating activity or product. (Sachs, 2011)
	•	The Strong Precautionary Principle can be contrasted with the dominant regulatory framework in the United States, in which government agencies usually bear the burden of proof to show unacceptable risk prior to restricting a product or activity. (Sachs, 2011)
	•	The Principle is not antithetical to a weighing of the costs and benefits of regulatory action. Indeed, critics overlook that a cost-benefit test could be applied within a Strong Precautionary framework, by requiring that the proponent of a risky activity prove that the benefits of the activity outweigh the costs (shifting that analytical burden off the government). (Sachs, 2011)
	•	Strong Precautionary Principle should not be applied dogmatically as a universal framework for managing every risk our society faces. (Sachs, 2011)
	•	Strong Precautionary Principle could be incorporated in concrete statutory provisions while avoiding the parade of horribles alleged by the critics. (Sachs, 2011)
	•	Strong Precautionary Principle suggests that some precautionary regulation should be a default response to serious risks under conditions of scientific uncertainty. 
	•	Strong Precautionary Principle explicitly places the burden on the private proponent of the risk-creating activity to overcome the default by proving that risks are accept- able or reasonable. (Sachs, 2011)
	•	Its language is broad, however, and it is often described in the literature as emblematic of the Strong Precautionary Principle:45When an activity raises threats of harm to human health or the environment, precautionary measures should be taken even if some cause-and-effect relationships are not fully established scientifically. In this context the proponent of an activity, rather than the public, should bear the burden of proof. (Sachs, 2011)
	•	Strong Precaution outlines a framework or stance toward decision making, not a meticulously detailed prescription for action. The details of regulatory design and the timing of response are determined through legislation, not the Principle itself. They will necessarily vary from one regulatory context to another. (Sachs, 2011)
	•	One defining feature of the Strong Precautionary Principle is that it places a governmental entity in a role as a risk gatekeeper. (Sachs, 2011)
	•	The Principle encourages conducting that risk assessment, where possible, on an ex ante, premarket basis, rather than in a reactive posture in response to harm that has already occurred. (Sachs, 2011)
	•	the Strong Precautionary Principle implies a more vigorous role for government to deter mine, ex ante, whether certain products or activities should be prohibited in the marketplace, given their health and environmental risks. (Sachs, 2011)
	•	Strong Precaution is usually operationalized through a governmental licensing, permitting, or preapproval system. In these contexts, the private proponent bears both the burden of production (researching the nature and extent of risks and making such evidence available for governmental review) and the burden of persuasion (demonstrating to the decision maker that specific statutory or regulatory safety standards have been met). (Sachs, 2011)
	•	Strong Precaution sends salutary signals to risk creators: it compels them to research the risks of their activities and sends an unmistakable message that we will not wait until damage is done before requiring some investigation and justification of the potential hazards. It ensures that the public is informed about, and has a say in, the deployment of technologies that may have serious public health impacts. (Sachs, 2011)
	•	A Strong Precautionary framework, in contrast, makes sense where a risk creator's "leap" might cause wide- spread, diffuse harm to others (consider mercury pollution from a power plant or a manufacturer's decision to use endocrine-disrupting chemicals in the plastics for toys). (Sachs, 2011)
	•	Strong Precaution establishes this risk gatekeeping mechanism. It offers both a procedural tool for incentivizing risk research and substan- tive default rules for protecting public health. (Sachs, 2011)
	•	The primary goal under Strong Precaution is to avoid Type II (false negative) decision errors. A risk regulatory regime grounded in Strong Precaution would aim to avoid the false conclusion that there is low risk for products and activities that in fact pose grave risks. (Sachs, 2011)
	•	Strong Precaution applies a default prohibition (or at least restriction) on the activity or product. Strong Pre- caution provides a window of opportunity for advance review of risks, and in implementing the Principle in a particular statute, legislators are making a decision to err on the side of caution when there are conflicting studies or insufficient information to characterize risks accurately.
	•	The Strong Precautionary Principle has become a punching bag for many scholars of risk regulation. (Sachs, 2011)
	•	the Strong Precautionary Principle cannot be a universally applicable approach to all health and environmental dangers. (Sachs, 2011)
	•	that society faces. But it can serve as the platform for protective risk decision making in discrete areas of law, including chemical regulation. (Sachs, 2011)
	•	They often maintain that the Principle is extreme, inflexible, anti-science, anti-growth, or anti- technology." Because Strong Precaution shifts the burden of proof on safety, critics allege that its implementation would prevent promising new technologies from getting off the ground, especially in emerging fields with a high degree of uncertainty about risks. (Sachs, 2011)
	•	the Strong Precautionary Principle would "eliminate technologies and strategies that make human lives easier, more convenient, healthier, and longer." 
	•	he Principle will be applied on the mere "conjecture"9 or "speculation"95 of a threat to health or the environment, suppressing important technolo- gies without any scientific basis. (Sachs, 2011)
	•	the Principle is, ultimately, paralyzing as an ap- proach to risk decision making.' If the Strong Precautionary Principle presumptively requires regulation of activities that present serious threats to health, safety, or the environment, then, according to Sunstein, the Principle will paralyze decision makers because threats may be created both by regulatory inaction and by regulatory action. (Sachs, 2011)
	•	Strong Precaution only seems appealing as an approach to risk because we naturally focus our attention on certain novel "target" risks (such as genetically modified foods or a chemical recently in the news, such as Bisphenol-A) and ig- nore both the opportunity costs of regulation and the risks presented by the status quo. (Sachs, 2011)
	•	the Strong Precautionary Principle as the view that "regulation is required when- ever there is a possible risk to health, safety, or the environment, even if the supporting evidence remains speculative and even if the economic costs of regulation are high." (Sachs, 2011)
	•	the strongest versions of the Pre- cautionary Principle, embodied in his own definition, might reflect "a position that no one is ultimately willing to hold." 
	•	The Strong Precautionary Principle does not impose a burden on any party to prove zero risk, nor does it state that all activities that pose a possible risk must be prohibited. Rather, the Principle, while shifting the burden of proof away from government, deliberately leaves the relevant standard of proofopen-ended and subject to democratic deliberation. The Principle requires that a proponent demonstrate that its product or activity meets a specified standard (predetermined through legislation) for how much risk is tolerable or acceptable in a given issue area. (Sachs, 2011)
	•	the Strong Precautionary Principle is not necessarily anti- thetical to cost-benefit analysis, though it has often been framed this way in the literature. (Sachs, 2011)
	•	In addition to providing flexibility to design risk standards, the Strong Precautionary Principle also affords flexibility to design default regulatory responses in the time period before the proponent has met the burden of proof. The extremist critique suggests that the only response of regulators, acting in accordance with the Strong Precautionary Prin- ciple, is to ban activities that pose possible or potential risks.142 But the Strong Precautionary Principle can be implemented through a variety of defaults beyond simplistic, binary (ban or no-ban) choices. (Sachs, 2011)
	•	the Strong Precautionary Principle clearly provides that the default can be overcome by proof of acceptable risks submitted by the applicant. (Sachs, 2011)
	•	The presence of tradeoffs, however, does not mean that the Strong Precautionary Principle is incoherent or paralyzing. Because of the cen- trality of the "paralysis" theme in the critical literature, I devote substan- tial attention to that critique here before turning to my proposal for re- forms to TSCA. (Sachs, 2011)
	•	Strong Precaution neces- sarily ignores risk-risk tradeoffs is that such tradeoffs can often be addressed within regulatory regimes grounded in Strong Precaution. In- deed, the shift in the burden of proof to proponents may highlight policy alternatives that may not come to light under traditional decision-making frameworks. (Sachs, 2011)
	•	trong Precaution does not inexorably lead to abdication of judg- ment. It does not doom legislators to extremist positions in which known, countervailing risks and the costs of legislation must be ignored. Rather, as the above examples illustrate, legislators can structure a Strong Precautionary regulatory regime to address both the "target risk" and countervailing risks. (Sachs, 2011)
	•	a Strong Precaution- ary regulatory regime need not preclude consideration of the costs and benefits of regulation. (Sachs, 2011)
	•	The Strong Precautionary Principle provides a framework to protect public health and safety, and some advocates of the Principle naturally want to universalize it as a guiding polestar for all areas of risk. (Sachs, 2011)
	•	A second reason that Strong Precaution should not be viewed as universally applicable is that putting government in a risk gatekeeping role can be complex, potentially anticompetitive, and expensive. (Sachs, 2011)
	•	the gatekeeping mechanism of the Strong Precautionary Principle should be reserved for serious threats that cannot be addressed through less intrusive mechanisms. For many forms of risk, there is no need to resort to the aggressive ex ante approach to risk implicit in the Strong Precautionary Principle. (Sachs, 2011)
	•	Critics of Strong Precaution also contend that the Principle locks in a "status quo bias."222 They contend that by adopting a stance of skepti- cism for new products or technologies, the Principle ignores the risks posed by existing products and technologies. (Sachs, 2011)
	•	major element of a Strong Precautionary approach to chemical regulation is a shift in the burden of proof. (Sachs, 2011)
	•	The Strong Precautionary Principle provides a useful framework for managing risk in the face of scientific uncertainty. (Sachs, 2011)
	•	If the strong version of the precautionary principle is taken seriously, extensive regulatory requirements are both required and forbidden. (Sunstein, 2005)
Weak Precautionary Principle 
	•	Weak Precautionary Principle does not prescribe any particular regulatory measures. (Sachs, 2011)
	•	Weak Precautionary Principle, while valid, is a mere "truism," so "banal" as to be hardly worth further scholarly exploration. (Sachs, 2011)
	•	weak versions of the Precautionary Principle permit the government to regulate risks under conditions of scientific uncertainty, 
	•	weak versions are primarily concerned with the timing of governmental decision making. (Sachs, 2011)
	•	Strong Precautionary Principle as the view that: (1) regulation should presumptively be applied when an activity or product poses serious threats to human health or the environment, even if scientific uncertainty precludes a full understanding of the nature or extent of the threats; and (2) the burden of overcoming the presumption in favor of regulation lies with the proponent of the risk-creating activity or product. (Sachs, 2011)
	•	the Weak Precautionary Principle implies a relatively libertarian view of the world, in which regulators are empowered (but not required) to in- tervene in the marketplace to address externalities-"threats of serious or irreversible damage" to the environment. (Sachs, 2011)
Predation
Overpredation
	•	In foodwebs, population dynamics can produce a reorganization of the network. When overfishing pushes a species below a cerain level, the foodweb rearranges the predations and new species take the place of the old one. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
Prediction
	•	a prediction implies certainty (we would be predicting that an event will occur). (Newsome, 2013)
	•	best parameters are those whose predictions fall closest to their targets. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
	•	Prediction allows us to examine the connection between our models and the real world in two somewhat different ways. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
	•	Those who venture to predict have long been criticized even when their forecasts prove accurate, in a technical sense. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
	•	There is always the possibility that a forecast be internally consistent from the modellers’ perspective while actively misdirecting the forecast user’s expectations. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
Future prediction
	•	Predicting the future is something that organizations credibly do all the time; and we know quite a lot about how socialandtechnical systems work, although organizations frequently don't fold that knowledge into their operations.The problem is that they assert an ability to know futures or control events that no one else can know or control. The problem is that the theories they build into their plans have so little valid support that theyare more ideology than knowledge. (Clarke, 1999)
Predictive analytical approach
	•	A predictive analytical approach will require an explicit scale of relative social values. (Starr, 1969)
Preference reversals
	•	Preference reversals have an important place in the history of the conversation between psychologists and economists. (Kahneman, 2012)

Presence
	•	Absence and presence have very primal effects upon us. Too much presence suffocates; a degree of absence spurs our interest. (Greene, 2018)

Presence of future
	•	‘presence of the future’, refers to the definition of current problems by their perceived future consequences. (Griner, 2002)
Presentation
	•	Briefings are a step up, but dependence on them saps intellectual acuity. It takes much longer to hear a given presentation than to read it, further reducing the effective use of limited time, and mediocre analysis seems better than it should when dressed up with PowerPoint, a confident voice, and an entertaining manner. (Betts, 2007)
Prestige
	•	Ce qui contribue surtout à donner aux idées propagées par l'affirmation, la répétition et la contagion, une puissance très grande, c'est qu'elles finissent par acquérir le pouvoir mystérieux nommé prestige. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Tout ce qui a dominé dans le monde, les idées ou les hommes, s'est imposé principalement par cette force irrésistible qu'exprime le mot prestige. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	 C'est un terme dont nous saisissons tous le sens, mais qu'on applique de façons trop diverses pour qu'il soit facile de le définir. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Le prestige peut comporter certains sentiments tels que l'admiration ou la crainte; il lui arrive parfois même de les avoir pour base, mais il peut parfaitement exister sans eux. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Ce sont des morts, et par conséquent des êtres que nous ne craignons pas, Alexandre, César, Mahomet, Bouddha, par exemple, qui possèdent le plus de prestige. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Le prestige est en réalité une sorte de domination qu'exerce sur notre esprit un individu, une œuvre ou une idée. Cette domination paralyse toutes nos facultés critiques et remplit notre âme d'étonnement et de respect. Le sentiment provoqué est inexplicable, comme tous les sentiments, mais il doit être du même ordre que la fascination subie par un sujet magnétisé. Le prestige est le plus puissant ressort de toute domination. Les dieux, les rois et les femmes n'auraient jamais régné sans lui. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	On peut ramener à deux formes principales les diverses variétés de prestige: le prestige acquis et le prestige personnel. Le prestige acquis est celui que donnent le nom, la fortune, la réputation. Il peut être indépendant du prestige personnel. Le prestige personnel est au contraire quelque chose d'individuel qui peut coexister avec la réputation, la gloire, la fortune, ou être renforcé par elles, mais qui peut parfaitement exister sans elles. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Le prestige acquis, ou artificiel, est de beaucoup le plus répandu. Par le fait seul qu'un individu occupe une certaine position, possède une certaine fortune, est affublé de certains titres, il a du prestige, quelque nulle que puisse être sa valeur personnelle. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Le Parthénon, dans son état actuel, est une misérable ruine absolument dépourvue d'intérêt; mais il possède un tel prestige qu'on ne le voit plus tel qu'il est, mais bien avec tout son cortège de souvenirs historiques. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Le propre du prestige est d'empêcher de voir les choses telles qu'elles sont et de paralyser tous nos jugements. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Les foules toujours, les individus le plus souvent, ont besoin, sur tous les sujets, d'opinions toutes faites. Le succès de ces opinions est indépendant de la part de vérité ou d'erreur qu'elles contiennent; il dépend uniquement de leur prestige. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	J'arrive maintenant au prestige personnel. Il est d'une nature fort différente du prestige artificiel ou acquis dont je viens de m'occuper. C'est une faculté indépendante de tout titre, de toute autorité, que possèdent un petit nombre de personnes, et qui leur permet d'exercer une fascination véritablement magnétique sur ceux qui les entourent, alors même qu'ils sont socialement leurs égaux et ne possèdent aucun moyen ordinaire de domination. Ils imposent leurs idées, leurs sentiments à ceux qui les entourent, et on leur obéit comme la bête féroce obéit au dompteur qu'elle pourrait si facilement dévorer. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	le prestige ne se fonde pas uniquement sur l'ascendant personnel, la gloire militaire et la terreur religieuse; il peut avoir des origines plus modestes, et cependant être considérable encore. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Entre les termes les plus éloignés de cette série, on placerait toutes les formes du prestige dans les divers éléments d'une civilisation: sciences, arts, littérature, etc., et l'on verrait qu'il constitue l'élément fondamental de la persuasion. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Consciemment ou non, l'être, l'idée ou la chose possédant du prestige sont par voie de contagion imités immédiatement et imposent à toute une génération certaines façons de sentir et de traduire leur pensée. L'imitation est d'ailleurs le plus souvent inconsciente, et c'est précisément ce qui la rend parfaite. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	bien des facteurs peuvent entrer dans la genèse du prestige: un des plus importants fut toujours le succès. Tout homme qui réussit, toute idée qui s'impose, cessent par ce fait même d'être contestés. La preuve que le succès est une des bases principales du prestige, c'est que ce dernier disparaît presque toujours avec lui. Le héros, que la foule acclamait la veille, est conspué par elle le lendemain si l'insuccès l'a frappé. La réaction sera même d'autant plus vive que le prestige aura été plus grand. La foule considère alors le héros tombé comme un égal, et se venge de s'être inclinée devant la supériorité qu'elle ne lui reconnaît plus. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	C'est toujours avec fureur que les croyants brisent les statues de leurs anciens dieux. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Le prestige enlevé par l'insuccès est perdu brusquement. Il peut s'user aussi par la discussion, mais d'une façon plus lente. Ce procédé est cependant d'un effet très sûr. Le prestige discuté n'est déjà plus du prestige. Les dieux et les hommes qui ont su garder longtemps leur prestige n'ont jamais toléré la discussion. Pour se faire admirer des foules, il faut toujours les tenir à distance. (Lebon, 1895)
Acquired prestige
	•	Le prestige acquis est celui que donnent le nom, la fortune, la réputation. Il peut être indépendant du prestige personnel. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Le prestige acquis, ou artificiel, est de beaucoup le plus répandu. Par le fait seul qu'un individu occupe une certaine position, possède une certaine fortune, est affublé de certains titres, il a du prestige, quelque nulle que puisse être sa valeur personnelle. (Lebon, 1895)
Personnal prestige
	•	Le prestige personnel est au contraire quelque chose d'individuel qui peut coexister avec la réputation, la gloire, la fortune, ou être renforcé par elles, mais qui peut parfaitement exister sans elles. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	J'arrive maintenant au prestige personnel. Il est d'une nature fort différente du prestige artificiel ou acquis dont je viens de m'occuper. C'est une faculté indépendante de tout titre, de toute autorité, que possèdent un petit nombre de personnes, et qui leur permet d'exercer une fascination véritablement magnétique sur ceux qui les entourent, alors même qu'ils sont socialement leurs égaux et ne possèdent aucun moyen ordinaire de domination. Ils imposent leurs idées, leurs sentiments à ceux qui les entourent, et on leur obéit comme la bête féroce obéit au dompteur qu'elle pourrait si facilement dévorer. (Lebon, 1895)
Print
	•	À notre sens, cette pensée avait deux faces. C'était d'abord une pensée de prêtre. C'était l'effroi du sacerdoce devant un agent nouveau, l'imprimerie. C'était l'épouvante et l'éblouissement de l'homme du sanctuaire devant la presse lumineuse de Gutenberg. C'était la chaire et le manuscrit, la parole parlée et la parole écrite, s'alarmant de la parole imprimée ; quelque chose de pareil à la stupeur d'un passereau qui verrait l'ange Légion ouvrir ses six millions d'ailes. C'était le cri du prophète qui entend déjà bruire et fourmiller l'humanité émancipée, qui voit dans l'avenir l'intelligence saper la foi, l'opinion détrôner la croyance, le monde secouer Rome. Pronostic du philosophe qui voit la pensée humaine, volatilisée par la presse, s'évaporer du récipient théocratique. Terreur du soldat qui examine le bélier d'airain et qui dit : La tour croulera. Cela signifiait qu'une puissance allait succéder à une autre puissance. Cela voulait dire : La presse tuera l'église. (Hugo and Chamarat, 1998)
	•	C'était pressentiment que la pensée humaine en changeant de forme allait changer de mode d'expression, que l'idée capitale de chaque génération ne s'écrirait plus avec la même matière et de la même façon, que le livre de pierre, si solide et si durable, allait faire place au livre de papier, plus solide et plus durable encore. Sous ce rapport, la vague formule de l'archidiacre avait un second sens ; elle signifiait qu'un art allait détrôner un autre art. Elle voulait dire : L'imprimerie tuera l'architecture. (Hugo and Chamarat, 1998)
	•	L'invention de l'imprimerie est le plus grand événement de l'histoire. C'est la révolution mère. C'est le mode d'expression de l'humanité qui se renouvelle totalement, c'est la pensée humaine qui dépouille une forme et en revêt une autre, c'est le complet et définitif changement de peau de ce serpent symbolique qui, depuis Adam, représente l'intelligence. (Hugo and Chamarat, 1998)
	•	Sous la forme imprimerie, la pensée est plus impérissable que jamais ; elle est volatile, insaisissable, indestructible. Elle se mêle à l'air. Du temps de l'architecture, elle se faisait montagne et s'emparait puissamment d'un siècle et d'un lieu. Maintenant elle se fait troupe d'oiseaux, s'éparpille aux quatre vents, et occupe à la fois tous les points de l'air et de l'espace. Nous le répétons, qui ne voit que de cette façon elle est bien plus indélébile  ? De solide qu'elle était elle devient vivace. Elle passe de la durée à l'immortalité. (Hugo and Chamarat, 1998)
Probability
	•	The invoking of probability is a symptom of cultural change. (Douglas, 2005)
	•	probability, expressed quantitatively, is a relatively recent idea. Although precursors of contemporary risk analysis can be traced as far back as early Mesopotamia, i t was not until the emergence of probability theory in the 17th century 
	•	that the intellectual tools for quantitative risk analysis became available. (Covello and Mumpower, 1986)
	•	preconditions for the emergence of probability theory were established approximately a century and a half before Pascal, largely because of a change in attitude of the Catholic Church. (Covello and Mumpower, 1986)
	•	Probaility, likelihood, and chance each mean the extent to which something could occur. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Probability implies quantitative expressions (using numbers). (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Quantitatively, probability can be expressed as a number from 0 to 1 or a percentage from 0% to 100%. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	The principles of this interpretation are: 1) Probability is a logical relation between statements. 2) Probability should always be given in relation to a given base of knowledge. 3) Probability is determined a priori, i.e. with no need of experiments. (Rosenberg, 2008)
	•	probability should always be given with the knowledge base that was used to determine it. (Rosenberg, 2008)
	•	the probability of propositions must also be determined a priori. (Rosenberg, 2008)
	•	Probabilities are predicted on the basis of given assumptions, with no connection to the verification of those assumptions by experiments. This is the reason for naming this interpretation ‘a priori’. (Rosenberg, 2008)
	•	some people are uncomfortable with numbers and have difficulty interpreting probabilities. Such people may be more at ease with a qualitative, verbal scale of uncertainty—provided that the words used to define the scale have a definite and clearly understood meaning. (Weiss, 2008)
	•	Mais les rois de nos jours, maintenus dans la limite du probable, n'ont plus l'audace de la volonté. (Dumas, 1998)
	•	Vous tournez dans un cercle vicieux, celui des probabilités. (Dumas, 1998)
Probability theory
	•	probability theory (and the cognitive revolution that it launched) is a phenomenon of the seventeenth century. (Beard, 2011)
	•	probability theory is part of logic. (Rosenberg, 2008)
Probabilistic analyses
	•	Probabilistic analyses are used in the social sciences for individual reactions within a population, but the full power of probabilistic thought has not been tried (Douglas, 2005:48)
	•	political risk analysis and assessment is about estimating the likelihood of future events. (Sottilotta, 2016)
Probability assessment
	•	An assessment of probability improves with assessments of probabilities with the analytical chain from source to risk. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Given good analysis of the risk from hazard to returns, the probability assessment is easier to hander. At the least, we should estimate the probability of the hazard being activated into a threat; the probability of the threat causing the event; and the probability of the event causing the returns. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Our assessment of probability is easier if we can ignore the implausible and assess the plausible. (Newsome, 2013)
Insensitivity to prior probability of outcomes
	•	Insensitivity to prior probability of outcomes. One of the factors that have no effect on representativeness but should have a major effect on probability is the prior probability, or base-rate frequency, of the outcomes. (Tversky and Kahneman, 1974)
Subjective probabilities
	•	subjective probabilities are systematically altered by a procedure in which one's best estimate does not serve as an anchor. (Tversky and Kahneman, 1974)
	•	Modern decision theory (12, 13) regards subjective probability as the quantified opinion of an idealized person. (Tversky and Kahneman, 1974)
	•	The derived probability is subjective in the sense that different individuals are allowed to have different probabilities for the same event (Tversky and Kahneman, 1974)
	•	The major contribution of this approach is that it provides a rigorous subjective interpretation of probability that is applicable to unique events and is embedded in a general theory of rational decision. (Tversky and Kahneman, 1974)
	•	subjective probabilities determine preferences among bets and are not de- rived from them, as in the axiomatic theory of rational decision. (Tversky and Kahneman, 1974) 
	•	The inherently subjective nature of probability has led many students to the belief that coherence, or internal consistency, is the only valid criterion by which judged probabilities should be evaluated. From the standpoint of the formal theory of subjective probability, any set of internally consistent probability judgments is as good as any other. (Tversky and Kahneman, 1974)

Probabilistic analysis
	•	The probabilistic analysis addresses the main deficiencies of the point estimate approach because it imparts more information to risk managers and the public and uses all of the available data (Paustenbach, 2002a)
	•	Probabilistic analyses have in recent years been recognized in regulatory guidance, and EPA's Risk Assessment Forum has published a document of principles for conducting Monte Carlo analyses (Paustenbach, 2002a)
Probabilistic approach
	•	[…] the probabilistic approach is considered to be optimal for characterizing exposures and health risks, because it does not tend to result in overly conservative or non-plausible risk values (Finley et al., 1994: Sielken et al., 1995; Thompson and Graham. 1996: Gargas et at., 1999). (Williams and Paustenbach, 2002)
Probability of an error
	•	Theprobabilityofanerrorcanthenbe estimated from several sources. On the one hand, it may be known what error rates are found for people performing such tasks elsewhere. It may be possible to carry out deliberate experiments, or to use the results of those done elsewhere for other purposes. Finally, it may be possible to extrapolate by starting from what is known about slightly different situations, and then correcting for special causes of ease or difficulty in this particular decision. Analysis of this kind emphasises the importance of the instrumentation available to the operators, of their controls, and of their working environment, since the probability of error does depend on the extent to which they have clear and unambiguous information on which to make their judgements. (Great Britain and Health and Safety Executive, 1992)
Probability of future events
	•	The probability of future events often is inferred from past frequencies (Newsome, 2013)
Probability judgement
	•	In making rough probability judgments, people commonly depend upon one of several simplified rules of thumb that greatly ease the burden of decision. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Using the “availability” rule, people judge the probability of an event by the ease with which they can imagine relevant instances of similar events or the number of such events that they can easily remember. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	With the “anchoring” strategy, people pick some natural starting point for a first approximation and then adjust this figure based on the results of additional information or analysis. Typically, they do not adjust the initial judgment enough. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Expressions of probability, such as possible and probable, are a common source of ambiguity that make it easier for a reader to interpret a report as consistent with the reader’s own preconceptions. The probability of a scenario is often miscalculated. Data on “prior probabilities” are commonly ignored unless they illuminate causal relationships. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	The ability to recall instances of an event is influenced by how recently the event occurred, whether we were personally involved, whether there were vivid and memorable details associated with the event, and how important it seemed at the time. These and other factors that influence judgment are unrelated to the true probability of an event. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	availability in memory influences judgments of probability. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Intelligence analysts have therefore to be brought up to shun vague terms, of the type that slip out when we are not sure but do not want to admit it, such as ‘more or less’, or ‘apparently’, or that standby ‘on the one hand/on the other hand’. The Butler Inquiry found that there was an unjustified mystique amongst the writers of intelligence assess- ments that fine distinctions such as that between ‘intelligence indicates’ and ‘intelligence shows’ would convey meaning to the readers, but in truth such word-smithing passes them by. Words that concentrate meaning in terms of quantifiers (most, several or few) or probabilities (likely, certain) need to be handled with care. Terms such as probably, likely, very likely, or almost certainly are held to indicate a greater than even chance. The terms unlikely and remote indicate a less then even chance that an event will occur; they do not imply that an event will not occur. Terms such as might or may reflect situations in which we are unable to assess the likelihood, generally because relevant information is unavailable, sketchy, or fragmented. Terms such as we cannot dismiss, we cannot rule out, or we cannot discount reflect an unlikely, improbable, or remote event whose consequences are such that it warrants mentioning. (Omand, 2014)
	•	probability statements are used in everyday life, not only in Strategic Intelligence estimations (Rosenberg, 2008)
	•	some people are uncomfortable with numbers and have difficulty interpreting probabilities. Such people may be more at ease with a qualitative, verbal scale of uncertainty—provided that the words used to define the scale have a definite and clearly understood meaning. (Weiss, 2008)
	•	Mais les rois de nos jours, maintenus dans la limite du probable, n'ont plus l'audace de la volonté. (Dumas, 1998)
Availability rule
	•	One simplified rule of thumb commonly used in making probability estimates is known as the availability rule. In this context, “availability” refers to imaginability or retrievability from memory. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	People are using the availability rule of thumb whenever they estimate frequency or probability on the basis of how easily they can recall or imagine instances of whatever it is they are trying to estimate. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	policymakers and journalists who lack the time or access to evidence to go into details must neces- sarily take shortcuts. The obvious shortcut is to use the availability rule of thumb for making inferences about probability. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	the availability rule of thumb is often used to make judgments about likelihood or frequency. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	For intelligence analysts, recognition that they are employing the availability rule should raise a caution flag. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Serious analysis of probability requires identification and assessment of the strength and interaction of the many variables that will determine the outcome of a situation. (Heuer, 1999)
Probability reasoning
	•	Most people do not have a good intuitive grasp of probabilistic reasoning. (Heuer, 1999)
Statistical probabilities
	•	Statistical probabilities are based on empirical evidence concerning relative frequencies. (Heuer, 1999)
Subjective probability
	•	Another approach commonly used in intelligence analysis is to make a “subjective probability” or “personal probability” judgment. Such a judgment is an expression of the analyst’s personal belief that a certain explanation or estimate is correct. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Verbal expressions of uncertainty—such as “possible,” “probable,” “unlikely,” “may,” and “could”—are a form of subjective probability judgment, but they have long been recognized as sources of ambiguity and misunderstanding. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	To express themselves clearly, analysts must learn to routinely communicate uncertainty using the language of numerical probability or odds ratios. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Sherman Kent, the first director of CIA’s Office of National Estimates, was one of the first to recognize problems of communication caused by imprecise statements of uncertainty. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	In briefings and reports, every use of such words as suggests, could, and likely should send up a flare in the analyst mind. Unless these troublesome words are holstered by facts or demonstrated expertise, we are just another opinion in a town full of opinion. (Petersen, 2003)
	•	The problem is not the use of suggests or similar verbs, or even the judgment itself, The problem is that too often that is behind the judgment is invisible to the audience. When no hard evidence is available and analysts are forced in rely on their expertise and experience in making a call, the tradecraft solution is to allow the expertise behind the judgment to show through by using an example from one of the six broad areas of knowledge to illustrate or amplify the point. A historical precedent. the parsing of a foreign word or phrase, or a reference to cultural practice have all been used to good effect in the past to buttress a judgment or establish credibility before offering the judgment. (Petersen, 2003)
	•	if there is no evidence or precedent or cultural factoid to support the judgment we are in effect listing possible outcomes then we should not make the judgment at all, because it tends to undercut not only the credibility of the current work but also the credibility of future work. (Petersen, 2003)
	•	some people are uncomfortable with numbers and have difficulty interpreting probabilities. Such people may be more at ease with a qualitative, verbal scale of uncertainty—provided that the words used to define the scale have a definite and clearly understood meaning. (Weiss, 2008)
	•	
Subjective interpretation
	•	According to the subjective interpretation, probabilities are nothing but propositions that report a subjective feeling of the utterer regarding the future occurrence of the event. (Rosenberg, 2008)
	•	The main difference between the subjective interpretation and the two other interpretations, as the title ‘subjective’ may suggest, is that it is not committed to one true answer to any question regarding probabilities. (Rosenberg, 2008)
Prior probability
	•	In assessing a situation, an analyst sometimes has two kinds of evi- dence available—specific evidence about the individual case at hand, and numerical data that summarize information about many similar cases. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	This type of numerical information is called a base rate or prior probability. The base-rate fallacy is that the numerical data are commonly ignored unless they illuminate a causal relationship. This is illustrated by the following experiment. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	The base rate, or prior probability, is what you can say about any hostile fighter in that area before you learn anything about the specific sighting. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Most people do not incorporate the prior probability into their reasoning because it does not seem relevant. It does not seem relevant because there is no causal relationship between the background information on the percentages of jet fighters in the area and the pilot’s observation. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	The so-called planning fallacy, to which I personally plead guilty, is an example of a problem in which base rates are not given in numerical terms but must be abstracted from experience. (Heuer, 1999)
Relative frequency
	•	the relative frequencies interpretation has only one simple principle: the probability of an event 1⁄4 the relative frequency of its past occurrences. (Rosenberg, 2008)
	•	Those companies have vast databases of statistics that allow them to compute the future probability that a new customer will lose his job, die or have his car stolen. Using those probabilities they can calculate the price of an insurance plan for this customer. The probability according to this interpretation is determined a posteriori rather than a priori: it is only after the data is gathered that one can calculate, precisely, the predicted probability for the event. (Rosenberg, 2008)
	•	In mathematical vocabulary the probability equals the limit of the relative frequency when the number of experiments is infinite. But this definition also renders this interpretation unpractical – we never actually have infinite data in real life. We need to take decisions (personal, political, ethical) on a finite database. Unlike what some people tend to think, having simply a vast number of events (yet a finite one) in the database is not enough to conclude that the computed probability is necessarily true. (Rosenberg, 2008)
	•	The relative frequencies interpretation that is so widespread in the sciences is just not available in the cases of strategic prediction. (Rosenberg, 2008)
Risk probability
	•	Better accountability promotes better analysis. And better analysis comes from the explicit explanations and conversations around probability and risk. (Schrage, 2005)
	•	Mathematics is not a substitute for judgment, nor do equations define analysis. But analyzing risk without probabilities is akin to discussing art without colors. You can do it, but don't be surprised at the sterility of the results. Unfortunately, with evidence I'd weight at 0.8 and a conclusion to which I'd assign a confidence rating of 1.0, I predict that until the intelligence community overcomes its reluctance to go the probability route, it will continue to compromise its ability to adequately assess national security risks and threats. (Schrage, 2005)
Problem solving
	•	The idea of "solving problems" is actually about two phenomena. It is resolving some difficult dilemma so that people can get on with whatever they're doing. We can't trade stocks today until we get somebody to fix these darned phones. But solving problems is also convincing others that deliberate thought and careful consideration are routinely brought to bear on the trouble at hand. (Clarke, 1999)
Professional life
	•	When it comes to a specific job or role to play in society, we have expectations about what is professional. We would be made to feel uncomfortable if our airplane pilot suddenly started to act like a car salesman, or a mechanic like a therapist, or a professor like a rock musician. If such people acted completely like themselves, dropping their masks and refusing to play their roles, we would question their competence. (Greene, 2018)
Professionnalism
Information-processing skills
	•	information-processing skills (e.g., directing the collection system to answer specific questions, discerning differences in deployments), are designed to integrate a complete and comprehensive assessment, based on maximum specific, reliable, and factual knowledge. (Honig, 2007)
Maintaining professional norms
	•	maintaining professional norms, means being impervious to negative influences (policy considerations, cultural prejudices) or to organizational ‘‘pathologies’’ (e.g., parochialism). (Honig, 2007)
Professional risk
	•	Professional risk revolved around correct procedures. (Roberts, 2001b)
Projection
	•	This is by far the most common way of dealing with our Shadow, because it offers almost daily release. We cannot admit to ourselves certain desires—for sex, for money, for power, for superiority in some area—and so instead we project those desires onto others.  (Greene, 2018)
People projection
	•	Keep in mind that when you are the target of other people’s projections, the temptation is to want to live upto their idealization of you, to be their fantasy. You get caught up in their excitement and you want to believe you are as great, strong, or empathetic as they imagine. Without realizing it, you begin to play the role they want you to play. You become the mother or father figure they crave. Inevitably, however, you will come to resent this—you cannot be yourself; you are not appreciated for your true qualities. Better to be aware of this dynamic before it entraps you. (Greene, 2018)
Proliferation
	•	Proliferation is the catchword of insecurity in the age of risk society. (Rasmussen, 2001) 
	•	Proliferation describes the accumulation of a threat across time. (Rasmussen, 2001)
	•	The construction of a risk depends on a scenario that constitutes a ‘real virtuality’ in Beck’s terms. Proliferation describes the logic in that scenario whereby minor problems of the present are constructed as major threats of the future. (Rasmussen, 2001)
Propaganda
	•	For Galileo uses propaganda. He uses psychological tricks in addition towhatever intellectual reasons he has to offer. These tricks are very success- ful; they lead him to victory. But they obscure the new attitude toward experience that is in the making, and postpone for centuries the possibility of a reasonable philosophy. They obscure the fact that the experience on which Galileo wants to base the Copernican view is nothing but the re- sult of his own fertile imagination, that it has been invented. They obscure this fact by insinuating that the new results which emerge are known and conceded by all, and need only be called to our attention to appear as the most obvious expression of the truth. (Feyerabend, 1993)
	•	Propaganda is a purposeful, directed effort to overcome censorship—the censorship of the group mind and the herd reaction. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
Insiduous propaganda
	•	When this uniformity accords with our own beliefs we call it an expression of the public conscience. When, however, it runs contrary to our beliefs we call it regimentation of the public mind and are inclined to ascribe it to insidious propaganda. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	Uniformity is, in fact, largely natural and only partly artificial. Public opinion may be as much the producer of “insidious propaganda” as its product. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
Propagandist
	•	To some the public relations counsel is known by the term “propagandist.” Others still call him press agent or publicity man. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
Propinquity theory
	•	Another theory advanced to justify the appropriation of territories without effective occupation is the old and very ambiguous theory of contiguity and continuity, also called "propinquity." (Conforti, 1986)
	•	According to the propinquity theory, the sovereignty acquired over a part of a geographical unit ipsofacto extends to all parts of the same unit. (Conforti, 1986)
	•	For instance, the sovereignty over an island belonging to an archipelago would entail sovereignty over the whole archipelago; the sovereignty acquired on the coast would entail sovereignty over all land behind thecoast (the "hinterland") up to a natural border. (Conforti, 1986)
Prospect theory
	•	Prospect theory is therefore more complex than utility theory. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	Prospect theory was accepted by many scholars not because it is “true” but because the concepts that it added to utility theory, notably the reference point and loss aversion, were worth the trouble; they yielded new predictions that turned out to be true. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	The fundamental ideas of prospect theory are that reference points exist, and that losses loom larger than corresponding gains. (Kahneman, 2012)
Proteins 
	•	Genes contained in the DNA are transcribed and translated to produce proteins. Proteins play a central role in almost every aspect of life: muscle movement, blood circulation, acting as enzymes, binding to hormones, etc. Moreover, proteins interact with each other: the production of a protein can be facilitated or hindered by the presence of other proteins in the cell. The delicate balance of these reciprocal influences is crucial for life. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
	•	Protein interact, in all the forms in which they can happen, represent a second layer of complexity. For example, several proteins can bind together. These macromolecules behave as molecular machines, performing functions in the machinery of the cell. To do so, they must have the correct geometrical shape to fit with each other. When a protein is folded in the wrong way, several problems can arise. For example, the proteins responsible for the ‘mad cow syndrome’ (Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease) in humans, i.e. the prions, are supposed to be nothing else than misfolded proteins. All the possible physical connections between proteins can be represented as a network. In the protein interaction network the vertices are proteins and an edge is drawn between them if they physically interact in the cell. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
	•	Proteins are not enough for making a cell work. The cell interchanges matter, energy, and information with the environment, through many different molecules, involved in millions of reactions. Hunger, satiety, coldness, and in general all the states experienced by the organism, depend on this set of reactions, called metabolism. The chains of reactions that convert one molecule into another, passing through a series of intermediates steps, are called metabolic pathways. However, reactions in cells rarely follow the pattern of an ordered sequence. For example, the final molecule often interacts with the initial one in order to stop the reaction. This feedback process closes a loop in the chain of reactions. The ensemble of all such paths yields an intricate metabolic network. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
Provocation
	•	c'est une coutume mauvaise que de faire du bruit en provoquant. Le bruit ne va pas à tout le monde, monsieur de Morcerf. (Dumas, 1998)
Pseudo environment
	•	most people’s sense of reality was shaped by what he termed “pseudo-environments.”. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
Psychology
Cognitive psychology
	•	A basic finding of cognitive psychology is that people have no conscious experience of most of what happens in the human mind. Many functions as- sociated with perception, memory, and information processing are conducted prior to and independently of any conscious direction. What appears spontaneously in consciousness is the result of thinking, not the process of thinking. (Heuer, 1999)
Psychological phenomena
	•	The titular founder of scientific psychology, Wilhelm Wundt, divided psychological phenomena into two types: those that could be measured and quantified in the laboratory (e.g., perceptual discriminations, behavioral reactions, etc.) and those that were culturally constituted and so best studied in their natural sociohistorical contexts. (Tomasello, 1998)

Psychometry
Psychometric paradigm
	•	Within the psychometric paradigm, people make quantitative judgments about the current and desired riskiness of diverse hazards and the desired level of regulation of each. These judgments are then related to judgments about other properties, such as (i) the hazard's status on characteristics that have been hypothesized to account for risk perceptions and attitudes (for example, voluntariness, dread, knowledge, controllability), (ii) the benefits that each hazard provides to society, (iii) the number of deaths caused by the hazard in an average year, and (iv) the number of deaths caused by the hazard in a disastrous year. (Slovic, 1987)
	•	The psychometric approach is also evident in correlational studies that have examined the relationship between specific classroom behaviours (such as teachers' requests) and learning outcomes (for example, Politzer 1980; Politzer, Ramirez, and Lewis 1981). (Ellis, 2006)
	•	
Psychometric techniques
	•	Psychometric techniques seem well suited for identifying similarities and differences among groups with regard to risk perceptions and attitudes. (Slovic, 1987)
Psychometric analysis
	•	The psychometric and interaction analysis traditions typically involve `quantitative' and `explanatory' research (Ellis, 2006)
Psychosis
Collective psychosis
	•	“des troubles mentaux, au sens le plus general du terme, don’t les individus qui en sont atteints ne sont pas conscients de la nature pathologique et qui s’appliquent à un ensemble de personnes unies par les liens plus ou moins serrés de lieu, d’époque, de conditions ou d’intérêts communs ». (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Dans la plupart des cas, les idées prévalentes se développent autour d’un thème de sorcellerie ou de mysticisme, comme ans les sectes où l’on voit se regrouper autour d’un personnage délirant central, qui joue le rôle d’élément inducteur actif, des débiles, des illuminés ou des exaltés. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	C’est onc bien l’idée fausse qui, devenant prévalente, et s’imposant à la plupart des membrs du groupe, caractérise la psychose collective. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	À partir du noyau dynamique que représentent les premiers individus atteints – qui peuvent être, eux, d’authentiques maladies mentaux – se développe un complexe idéo-affectif que les circonstances de temps et de lieu aideront à parvenir à maturité. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	“comme pour la psychose individuelle, écrit G. Heuyer (op. cit., p. 92), il y a psychose collective lorsque l’idée émise par un ou plusierus membres du groupe, répandue par l’in des mécanismse multiples de la contagion colelctive, apporte au groupe social le plus large une perturbation qui risque de désagréger la vie sociale organisée. » (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Basées surtout sur la peur liée au context historico-social, les psychoses collectives puisent également leurs sources dans le gout du mystère, de l’extraordinaire et la fascination du spectaculaire. Les conditions de groupe, la contagion émotionnelle e les mass media font le reste. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	«  La presse surtout est responsable de la diffusion inconsidérée des idées absurdes et nuisibles. Sans doute le mythe des soucoupes volantes est moins dangereux que la description détaillée et réaliste, par les textes et les dessins, de la technique de crimes et des viols sadiques (…). (Les responsables de l’information) devraient éviter de fournir aux illuminés, au charlatans et aux pervers les moyens de troubler la sottise et l’anxiété d’un grand nombre de lecteurs. » (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	On ne saurait trop insister, en effet sur les pouvoir insidieux qu’ont les mass media sue le grand public et surtout, bien entendu, sur les personnalités faibles ou fragiles, ou tout simplement naïves. La page imprimée, le commentaire radiodiffusé ou télévisé acquièrent un autorité qui leur vient de leur mode de diffusion même. Que de fois peut-on entendre des gens s’exclamer : “ C’est vrai, je l’ai lu dans le journal (ou dans un livre) ou je l’ai vu à la television “, comme si le simple fait d’être “publié” par un organisme de presse official pouvait suffire à accréditer une nouvelle ou un événement. Ceux-ci peuvent être faux par ailleurs, le “baptême” que leur donne les media les transforme en une réalité que l’on accepte le plus souvent sans critique, sans la necessaire reserve qu’appelle l’insuffisance d’attestations. Ce sont même parfois des suppositions de jounralistes qui sont prises pour argent comptant. A moins que ces derniers, toujours en mal de sensationnel, ne se fassent plus ou moins innocemment les relais d’élucubrations diverses. On assiste, par exemple, actuellement à une veritable campagne de demoralisation et de propagation d’angoisse centrée sur l’éventualité d’une guerre nucléaire. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Les psychoses collectives n’ont pas toujours de consequences fâcheuses. Mais il arrive qu’elels conduisent ceux qui en sont atteints à des extrémités regrettables. C’est ainsi que l’exaltation du moment, l’obnubilation de la pensée et l’élan donné par les autres peuvent aboutir à un véritble délire d’action. Mus par la certitude inébranlable que leur confère l’enthousiame, on voit alors des individus traverser les flames, se flagellar en chantant, danser jusqu’à épuisement. (Mannoni, 1985)
Public
	•	The public pursues an informal, probably messy "logic" that the experts do not share. (Perrow, 1999)
	•	hommes et les femmes qui constituent le public sont confrontés à un modèle auquel ils sont préssés de se conformer. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	The public today demands information and expects also to be accepted as judge and jury in matters that have a wide public import. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	The public and the press, or for that matter, the public and any force that modifies pubic opinion, interact. Action and interaction are continually going on between the forces projected out to the public and the public itself. The public relations counsel must understand this fact in its broadest and most detailed implications. He must understand not only what these various forces are, but he must be able to evaluate their relative powers with fair accuracy. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
Public acceptance of risk
	•	"public acceptance of any risk is more dependent on public confidence in risk management than on the quantitative estimates of risk consequences, probabilities, and magnitudes (Starr, 1985)." (Paustenbach, 2002c)
Public ambivalence
	•	Public ambivalence is also a response to the obscurity and complexity of science, which appear to threaten the power of the citizen. (Nelkin, 1992)
Public anxiety
	•	public anxiety about risk appears to be inversely related to the degree of control of societal risks, or to put it another way, as life becomes safer so do the public find other risks to worry about (Rothstein et al., 2006)
Public availability
	•	Public availability is conferred by the collectivity itself (Douglas, 2005:130)
	•	political risk analyst is expected not only to know thoroughly the present conditions of a given country, region or industry but also to be able to inform the decision-maker – that is, his or her client – about the possible futures that lie ahead, considering both the most and the least likely. (Sottilotta, 2016)
Public debate
	•	In the public debate the future form of the society is at stake; the contenders define the options (Douglas, 2005:134)
	•	Debates among experts are apt to heighten public uncertainty about what the facts really are, increase doubts about whether the hazards are really understood, and de- crease the credibility of official spokespersons. If the risks are already feared by the public, then increased concern is the likely result. (Kasperson et al., 1988)
Public engagement
	•	Public engagement is not a stage of governance that can be completed, tidied up and filed away. It raises more troublesome questions about how to take into account a greater diversity of voices, how these relate to scientific forms of expertise, and how decisions should be made in conditions of social and technical uncertainty. Public engagement is only the start of a discussion. (Stilgoe et al., 2006)
Public judgement
	•	The public judged some risks on the possibility of a disaster, not the historical record; that would explain why the public would worry about nuclear power regardless of the number of people killed on the highways. (Perrow, 1999)
Public sphere
	•	Life in the public sphere means wearing a mask, and sometimes some people wear the mask of “authenticity.” (Greene, 2018)

General public
	•	The general public usually receives much less information on how risks are characterized than do risk managers (e.g., they may be presented only with the upper-bound value of a point estimate). (Williams and Paustenbach, 2002)
Member of a public
	•	A member of the public can be defined either as anybody living at a defined radius from an establishment, or somebody following a particular pattern of life; orthe risk to society as a whole - 'societal risk', as represented, for example, by the chance of a large accident causing a defined number of deaths or injuries. (Great Britain and Health and Safety Executive, 1992)
Public attention
	•	Public attention is actually a nuisance and a distraction. (Greene, 2014)
Public conscience
	•	When this uniformity accords with our own beliefs we call it an expression of the public conscience. When, however, it runs contrary to our beliefs we call it regimentation of the public mind and are inclined to ascribe it to insidious propaganda. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
Public hearing
	•	Public influence through hearings is a matter of dispute and a much understudied question. (Webler and Renn, 1995)
	•	public hearings do offer citizens an opportunity to get fIrst hand information about government and project proponents' intentions. (Webler and Renn, 1995)
	•	Public hearings may also provide an effective means for people to influence policy, but more research is needed to support this counter-intuitive conclusion. (Webler and Renn, 1995)
Public irrational thesis
	•	The most popular explanation for the science communication paradox can be called the “public irrationality thesis” or “PIT.” Members of the public, PIT stresses, are not very science literate. In addition, they do not think like scientists. Scientists assess risk in a conscious, deliberate fashion, employing the analytical reasoning necessary to make sense of empirical evidence. Members of the public, in contrast, appraise hazards intuitively, on the basis of fast-acting unconscious emotions. As a result, members of the public overestimate dramatic or sensational risks like terrorism and discount more remote but more consequential ones — like climate change [Weber, 2006; Marx et al., 2007; Sunstein, 2007; Sunstein, 2005]. (Kahan, 2015)
	•	Under PIT, one should expect individuals who are high in science comprehension to use their knowledge and reasoning proficiency to form risk perceptions supported by the best available scientific evidence. (Kahan, 2015)
	•	Accordingly, under PIT one would predict that as members of opposing cultural groups become more science literate and more adept at analytical reasoning — and thus less dependent on heuristic substitutes for science comprehension — they should converge in beliefs on climate change. (Kahan, 2015)

Public good
	•	Public goods are defined by Samuelson (1954) as goods which are freely available and from the enjoyment of which no one can be excluded (Douglas, 2005:129)
	•	As Steiner points out, under this definition, a public good is not necessarily in joint supply (a collective consumption good). Instead, it is a good that differs ‘appreciably in either quantity or quality [from] the alternative the private market would produce and [there is] a viable demand for the difference’ (1974:247) (Douglas, 2005:130)
	•	Public goods are publicly supplied because they cannot be adequately supplied through the market (Torriti and Ikpeb, 2014)
Public mind
	•	press stands preeminent among the various institutions which are commonly designated as leaders or molders of the public mind. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
Public relations
	•	Public relations was about fashioning and projecting credible renditions of reality itself. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	in the relationship between systems of communication and the exercise of power. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	The difficulty of establishing and building new channels of approach to the public is shown best by an examination of the principal mediums which are available to the public relations counsel who desires to direct public thought to the problems of the group he represents. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
Public relation counsel
	•	The public relations counsel, he argued, specialized in understanding the public mind and knowing how to create those circumstances that would gain public attention to consolidate public opinion. A pivotal aspect of the PR counsel’s “wide range of instruments and techniques,” as Bernays described them, was an intimate knowledge of those “mediums … through which public attention is reached and influenced.… the channels of thought and communication.” (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	Describing the peculiar aptitude of the public relations counsel, Bernays maintained “it is his capacity for crystallizing the obscure tendencies of the public mind before they have reached definite expression, which makes him so valuable.”  (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	Bernays was careful to insert the notion that the “public relations counsel” must closely adhere to ethical standards. Manipulating mass perception is always a dodgy exercise, but without a backbone of ethics, even Bernays was aware that it could be used towards dangerous ends. There is one danger in the use of stereotypes by the public relations counsel. That … demagogues in every field of social relationship can take advantage of the public. At the end of the day, the counsel’s intellectual arsenal had one primary purpose: the manufacture of news. “The public relations counsel must not only supply news—he must create news.” This didn’t happen by dropping off press releases at newspaper or other media offices. It came instead from an educated ability to understand “what news actually is”—what it looks and tastes like—and the capacity to orchestrate occurrences that will attract news coverage and be viewed by the public as current events. The public relations counsel must lift startling facts from his whole subject and present them as news. He must isolate ideas and develop them into events so that they can be more readily understood and so they can claim attention as news. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011) 
	•	the job of a public relations counsel is to instruct a client on how to take actions that “just interrupt … the continuity of life in some way to bring about the [media] response.” (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	News is any overt act which juts out of the routine of circumstance.… A good public relations man advises his client … to carry out an overt act … interrupting the continuity of life in some way to bring about a response. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	I have tried to set down the board principles that govern the new profession of public relations counsel. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	the activities of the public relations counsel affect the daily life of the entire population in one form or another. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	To some the public relations counsel is known by the term “propagandist.” Others still call him press agent or publicity man. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	position as one who directs and supervises the activities of his clients wherever they impinge upon the daily life of the public. He interprets the client to the public, which he is enabled to do in part because he interprets the public to the client. His advice is given on all occasions on which his client appears before the public, whether it be in concrete form or as an idea. His advice is given not only on actions which take place, but also on the use of mediums which bring these actions to the public it is desired to reach, no matter whether these mediums be the printed, the spoken or the visualized word—that is, advertising, lectures, the stage, the pulpit, the newspaper, the photograph, the wireless, the mail or any other form of thought communication. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	The rise of the modern public relations counsel is based on the need for and the value of his services. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	Public opinion has entered life at many points as a decisive factor. Men and movements whose interests will be affected by the attitude of the public are taking pains to have themselves represented in the court of public opinion by the most skillful counselors they can obtain. The business of the public relations counted is somewhat like the business of the attorney—to advise his client and to litigate his causes for him. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	The public relations counsel is first of all a student. His field of study is the public mind. His text books for this study are the facts of life; the articles printed in newspapers and magazines, the advertisements that are inserted in publications, the billboards that line the streets, the railroads and the highways, the speeches that are delivered in legislative chambers, the sermons issuing from pulpits, anecdotes related in smoking rooms, the gossip of Wall Street, the patter of the theater and the conversation of other men who, like them, are interpreters and must listen for the clear or obscure enunciations of the public. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	He brings the talent of his intuitive understanding to the aid of his practical and psychological tests and surveys. But he is not only a student. He is a practitioner with a wide range of instruments and a definite technique for their use. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	First of all, there are the circumstances and events he helps to create. After that there are the instruments by which he broadcasts facts and ideas to the public; advertising, motion pictures, circular letters, booklets, handbills, speeches, meetings, parades, news articles, magazine articles and whatever other mediums there are through which public attention is reached and influenced. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	The politician can tell what to emphasize to his audience, but the ability to estimate group reactions on a large scale over a wide geographic and psychological area is a specialized ability which must be developed with the same painstaking self-criticism and with the same dependence on experience that are required for the development of the clinical sense in the doctor or the surgeon. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	mind, the work of the public relations counsel will necessarily have close contacts with the work of the journalist. He transmits his ideas, however, through all those mediums which help to build public opinion—the radio, the lecture platform, advertising, the stage, the motion picture, the mails. On the other hand, he is becoming today as much of an adviser on actions as he is the communicator of these actions to the public. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	The public relations consultant is ideally a constructive force in the community. The results of his work are often accelerated interest in matters of value and importance to the social, economic or political life of the community. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	The public relations counsel is the pleader to the public point of view. He acts in this capacity as a consultant both in interpreting the public to his client and in helping to interpret his client to the public. He helps to mould the action of his client as well as to mould public opinion. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	The public relations counsel works with that vague, little-understood, indefinite material called public opinion. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	The mental equipment of the average individual consists of a mass of judgments on most of the subjects which touch his daily physical or mental life. These judgments are the tools of his daily being and yet they are his judgments, not on a basis of research and logical deduction, but for the most part dogmatic expressions accepted on the authority of his parents, his teachers, his church, and of his social, his economic and other leaders. The public relations counsel must understand the social implications of an individual’s thoughts and actions. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	The public relations counsel must deal with the fact that persons who have little knowledge of a subject almost invariably form definite and positive judgments upon that subject. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	the public relations counsel has to consider the a prori judgment of any public he deals with before counseling any step that would modify those things in which the public has established belief. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	The counsel on public relations, after examination of the sources of established beliefs, must either discredit the old authorities or create new authorities by making articulate a mass opinion against the old belief or in favor of the new. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	In view then of the possibility of a malleable public opinion the counsel on public relations, desiring to obtain a hearing for any given cause, simply utilizes existent channels to obtain expression for the point of view he represents. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	Because of the importance of channels of thought communication, it is vital for the public relations counsel to study carefully the relationship between public opinion and the organs that maintain it or that influence it to change. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	The public and the press, or for that matter, the public and any force that modifies pubic opinion, interact. Action and interaction are continually going on between the forces projected out to the public and the public itself. The public relations counsel must understand this fact in its broadest and most detailed implications. He must understand not only what these various forces are, but he must be able to evaluate their relative powers with fair accuracy. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	The public relations counsel is not needed to persuade people to standardize their points of view or to persist in their established beliefs. The established point of view becomes established by satisfying some real or assumed human need. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	The public relations counsel can come forward, first, as the representative of established things when their security is shaken, or when they desire greater power; and second, as the representative of the group which is struggling to establish itself. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	The public relations counsel, through the mediums chosen by him, presented to the public the information necessary to aid in understanding America’s war aims and ideals. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	The difficulty of establishing and building new channels of approach to the public is shown best by an examination of the principal mediums which are available to the public relations counsel who desires to direct public thought to the problems of the group he represents. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	The public relations counsel must take into account that many groups exist, and that there is a very definite interlapping of groups. Because of this he is enabled to utilize many types of appeal in reaching any one group, which he subdivides for his purposes. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	Changed external conditions must be taken into account by the public relations counsel in his work. Such changes carry with them modifications in the interests and points of view of those they affect. They make it possible to modify group and individual reaction. The public relations counsel, too, can modify the results of the changed external condition by calling attention to it or interpreting it in terms of the interest of those affected. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	The public relations counsel extracts from his clients’ causes ideas which will capitalize certain fundamental instincts in the people he is trying to reach, and then sets about to project these ideas to his public. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
Public relation experts
	•	Bernays then sketched a picture of the public relations expert as a member of the “intelligent few” who advises clients on how to “deal with the masses … just by applying psychology.” As a member of that intellectual elite which guides the destiny of society, the PR “professional,” Bernays explained, aims his craft at a general public that is essentially, and unreflectively, reactive. Working behind the scenes, out of public view, the public relations expert is “an applied social scientist,” one educated to employ an understanding of “sociology, psychology, social psychology and economics” in order to influence and direct public attitudes. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	Public opinion has entered life at many points as a decisive factor. Men and movements whose interests will be affected by the attitude of the public are taking pains to have themselves represented in the court of public opinion by the most skillful counselors they can obtain. The business of the public relations counted is somewhat like the business of the attorney—to advise his client and to litigate his causes for him. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	First of all, there are the circumstances and events he helps to create. After that there are the instruments by which he broadcasts facts and ideas to the public; advertising, motion pictures, circular letters, booklets, handbills, speeches, meetings, parades, news articles, magazine articles and whatever other mediums there are through which public attention is reached and influenced. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	The public relations counsel works with public opinion. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
Public relations practitioner
	•	Bernays portrayed the public relations practitioner as an instrumental social scientist, a resolute student of human motivation. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
Public relations research
	•	Public relations studies analyze the effects of organizations’ crisis communication on publics or individuals (e.g., situational crisis communication theory [SCCT], see Coombs, 2007; Jin, Liu, & Austin, 2011) mainly through experiments, but studies that take the mediating role of media into account are sparse (but see Huang, 2006; Kiousis et al., 2007). (Kleinnijenhuis et al., 2015)
Publication
	•	Publications have been extensively standardized in recent years: articles are mostly in English, control methods have been homogenized (mainly through peer review), measures of impact have been devised, etc. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
Publication network
	•	At the same time, large electronic databases of publications have been established, with thousands of new items being added every day: articles, books, patents, projects, etc. All this produces a large network of publications: two items are connected if one of them cites the other. We can also identify authorship from these databases and create networks of collaborations between scientists. These systems are increasingly used to map and visualize the development of knowledge and the most active areas of science. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
Scientific publication
	•	Timing is important in a large range of networks: for example, scientific publications are arrayed in time, and they can only cite papers that came out in the past. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
Punishment
	•	En punissant l’individu anomique, la collectivité châtie donc sa proper impulsion à la transgression. (Mannoni, 1985)
Altruistic punishment
	•	People can be keen on punishing rule breakers even if the punishment of a few is bad for themselves; their motivation make evolutionary and rational sense if such punishment improves future compliance with rules – this motivation is know as altruistic punishment. (Newsome, 2013)
Purpose
False purpose
	•	Is the freedom to do what they please their primary motivation? Are they mostly after pleasure, money, attention, power for its own sake, or a cause to join? These are what we shall call false purposes, and they lead to obsessive behavior and various dead ends. (For more on false purposes, see the last section of this chapter.) Once you identify people as motivated by a false purpose, you should avoid hiring or working with them, as they will tend to draw you downward with their unproductive energy. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Human nature being what it is, however, many people seek to create purpose and a feeling of transcendence on the cheap, to find it in the easiest and most accessible way, with the least amount of effort. Such people give themselves over to false purposes, those that merely supply the illusion of purpose and transcendence. (Greene, 2018)
	•	False purposes come from external sources— belief systems that we swallow whole, conformity to what other people are doing. (Greene, 2018)
	•	False purposes lead downward, to the animal side of our nature—to addictions, loss of mental powers, mindless conformity, and cynicism. (Greene, 2018)
	•	No matter the objects of the pursuit, they tend to lead to a dynamic of diminishing returns. The moments of pleasure we get tend to get duller through repetition. We need either more and more of the same or constantly new diversions. Our need often turns into an addiction, and with the dependency comes a diminishing of health and mental powers. We become possessed by the objects we crave and lose ourselves. Under the influence of drugs or alcohol, for instance, we can temporarily feel transported beyond the banality of our lives. (Greene, 2018)
	•	This form of false purpose is very common in the world today, largely because of the cornucopia of distractions we can choose from. But it goes against a basic element of human nature: to have deeper levels of pleasure, we have to learn to limit ourselves. (Greene, 2018)
Real purpose
	•	The real purpose comesfrom within. It is an idea, a calling, a sense of mission that we feel personally and intimately connected to. It is our own; we may have been inspired by others, but nobody imposed it upon us and nobody can take it away. If we are religious, we don’t merely accept the orthodoxy; we go through rigorous introspection and make our belief inward, true to ourselves. (Greene, 2018)
	•	The real purpose leads us upward, to a more human level. We improve our skills and sharpen our minds; we realize our potential and contribute to society. (Greene, 2018)
Sense of purpose
	•	Concentrate on maintaining a high sense of purpose, and the success will flow to you naturally. (Greene, 2018)
Practice
	•	In our culture we tend to denigrate practice. We want to imagine that great feats occur naturaly – that they are sign of someone’s genius or superior talent. Getting to a high level of achievement through practice seems so banal, so uninspiring. (Greene, 2014)
	•	It is time o reverse this prejudice against conscious effort and to see the powers we gain through practice and discipline as eminently inspiring and even miraculous. (Greene, 2014)
	•	When we sense the possible unity of mind and body in the early stages of practice, we are being guided toward this power. It is the natural bent of our brain to want to move in the direction, to elevate its powers through repetition. (Greene, 2014)
	•	(…) venerate the transformative powers we gain through practice. (Greene, 2014)

Praise
Poisonous praise
	•	Similarly, in noting your success, they may bring up the least likable parts of your audience, the kinds of fans or consumers who do not reflect well on you. “Well, I’m sure Wall Street executives are going to love this.” This is thrown in among other normal comments, but the guilt by association lingers in your mind. Or they will praise something once you have lost it—a job, a house in a nice neighborhood, a spouse who has left you. “That was such a beautiful house. What a shame.” It’s all said in a way that seems compassionate but has a discomforting effect. Poisonous praise almost always indicates envy. They feel the need to praise, but what dominates is the underlying hostility. If they have a habit of praising in this way, if you experience it several times, it is probably an indication of something more intense stirring within them. (Greene, 2018)
Prediction
	•	prediction is an apodictic (non-probabilistic) statement, on an absolute confidence level, about the future (Jantsch (1967, p. 15) (Sottilotta, 2016)
	•	A prediction shows where things are headed, with an appearance of precision, but experience suggests you have no reason to believe it (Bauer, 2014) (Sottilotta, 2016)
	•	The degree to which the description is favorable is unaffected by the reliability of that description or by the degree to which it permits accurate prediction. (Tversky and Kahneman, 1974)
	•	Hence, if people predict solely in terms of the favorableness of the description, their predictions will be insensitive to the reliability of the evidence and to the expected accuracy of the prediction. (Tversky and Kahneman, 1974)
	•	When predictability is nil, the same prediction should be made in all cases. (Tversky and Kahneman, 1974)
	•	If predictability is perfect, of course, the values predicted will match the actual values and the range of predictions will equal the range of outcomes. In general, the higher the predictability, the wider the range of predicted values. (Tversky and Kahneman, 1974)
	•	people often predict by selecting the outcome (for example, an occupation) that is most representative of the input (for example, the description of a person). The confidence they have in their prediction depends primarily on the degree of representativeness (that is, on the quality of the match between the selected outcome and the input) with little or no regard for the factors that limit predictive accuracy.  (Tversky and Kahneman, 1974)
	•	predicting a technology’s costs, risks, and benefits requires social and behavioral science knowledge, just as it might require knowledge from seismology, meteorology, metrology, physics, mechanical engineering, or computer science. (Fischhoff, 2013)
	•	getting predictions right or wrong is not all that matters. The point is also to capture a broad range of issues and events that will shape the coming years, to give a sense of the global agenda, to which decision-makers ought to be pay- ing more attention.. (Omand, 2014)
	•	Unfortunately, the word ‘prediction’ has become identified with the act of forecasting specific adversary courses of action over some specific time period with associated specific probabilities (a feature of structured analysis approaches). Analytical activity might escape this mind-set by referring instead to anticipation of ranges of activities or ‘course of action envelopes’. (Hoffman et al., 2011)
	•	When it comes to predicting what a system will do next, data on the recent state of the system often provide more information than data on some long past state of the system.Smith, Leonard. Chaos: A Very Short Introduction (Very Short Introductions) . OUP Oxford. Kindle Edition. When it comes to predicting what a system will do next, data on the recent state of the system often provide more information than data on some long past state of the system. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
Insensitivity to predictability
	•	Insensitivity to predictability. People are sometimes called upon to make such numerical predictions as the future value of a stock, the demand for a commodity, or the outcome of a football game. Such predictions are often made by representativeness. (Tversky and Kahneman, 1974)
Errors of prediction
	•	errors of prediction are inevitable because the world is unpredictable. (Kahneman, 2012)

Predictive accuracy
	•	to maximize predictive accuracy, final decisions should be left to formulas, especially in low- validity environments. (Kahneman, 2012)
Predictability
	•	Predictability is a useful concept because it can help you separate certainties from uncertainties in a scenario. (Newsome, 2013)
Predictability of arguments
	•	Predictability of arguments and behavior means that people know what to expect from a particular person or organization. (Poortinga and Pidgeon, 2003)
Predictability of behaviors
	•	Predictability of arguments and behavior means that people know what to expect from a particular person or organization. (Poortinga and Pidgeon, 2003)
Preface
	•	A preface’s function is by definition to be prefatory, and space permits me to make only one further point by way of clarification. (Coker, 2009)
Preference
Individual preference
	•	Individual preferences, however, must not be overemphasised. Individuals preferences can only affect the choices of associates within limited sets of available alternatives. (Hassan et al., 2011)
Preferential attachment
	•	This realization is due to physicists Albert-László Barabási and Réka Albert. Barabási and Albert put forward a mathematical model of the growth of a network. They imagined a graph that starts with a small set of vertices (even just two or three), connected at random. New nodes are added at a steady rate to this initial nucleus, each of them carrying a given number of links. A simple rule establishes how new nodes are linked: incoming vertices prefer old ones that already have many links. This mechanism is called preferential attachment. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
	•	The more connections a node has at a certain moment, the more it is capable of attracting new connections. This is why the preferential attachment is also called the rich-get-richer mechanism. As a consequence, the initially small differences in connectivity are progressively amplified. Thus, a hierarchy of different nodes emerges, with a large variety in their degrees, ranging from the least connected ones to those that have accumulated many links, i.e. the hubs. The resulting network is heterogeneous, with a power-law degree distribution. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
	•	Preferential attachment is the network version of a mechanism at work in many natural and social phenomena whose future evolution depends on their history. For example, the size of cities changes in time according to their present size: large cities experience large increases, small cities have small changes. Tomorrow’s stock prices are also proportional, on average, to today’s prices. This mechanism is also called multiplicative noise. There are various reasons why such a process may be at work in many networks. In some situations, having many links is the main way to be discovered by new nodes. A website linked to by many others is more easily found by people browsing the Web than is a less linked one. The same happens to highly cited papers. This increased visibility makes it easier to receive even more links or citations. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
	•	Like preferential attachment, it is unlikely that the fitness mechanism is at work in all real-world networks. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
President’s Daily Brief
	•	Current Intelligence includes the President’s Daily Brief (PDB), the Senior Executive Intelligence Brief (SEIB), and the Economic Executives’ Intelligence Brief (EEIB), according to the CIA’s website. (Marrin, 2002)
	•	The PDB is geared exclusively to the interests of the President, and is distributed to only a handful of other officials. (Marrin, 2002)
	•	The SEIB – formerly the National Intelligence Daily--is both less sensitive and more broadly distributed than the PDB, but with a similar focus on breaking issues. The EEIB “takes a multidisciplinary look at the issues on economic officials’ agendas, including foreign trade practices, illicit finance, and international energy developments.” (Marrin, 2002)
Press
	•	À notre sens, cette pensée avait deux faces. C'était d'abord une pensée de prêtre. C'était l'effroi du sacerdoce devant un agent nouveau, l'imprimerie. C'était l'épouvante et l'éblouissement de l'homme du sanctuaire devant la presse lumineuse de Gutenberg. C'était la chaire et le manuscrit, la parole parlée et la parole écrite, s'alarmant de la parole imprimée ; quelque chose de pareil à la stupeur d'un passereau qui verrait l'ange Légion ouvrir ses six millions d'ailes. C'était le cri du prophète qui entend déjà bruire et fourmiller l'humanité émancipée, qui voit dans l'avenir l'intelligence saper la foi, l'opinion détrôner la croyance, le monde secouer Rome. Pronostic du philosophe qui voit la pensée humaine, volatilisée par la presse, s'évaporer du récipient théocratique. Terreur du soldat qui examine le bélier d'airain et qui dit : La tour croulera. Cela signifiait qu'une puissance allait succéder à une autre puissance. Cela voulait dire : La presse tuera l'église. (Hugo and Chamarat, 1998)
	•	We can see the energy with which the press exposes the slightest flaw in those in power, and the feeding frenzy that ensues. (Greene, 2018)
	•	la diffusion récente de la presse qui met sans cesse sous les yeux des foules les opinions les plus contraires. Les suggestions que chacune d'elles pourrait engendrer sont bientôt détruites par des suggestions opposées. Il en résulte que chaque opinion n'arrive pas à s'étendre et est vouée à une existence très éphémère. Elle est morte avant d'avoir pu se répandre assez pour devenir générale. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	la presse, autrefois directrice de l'opinion, elle a dû, comme les gouvernements, s'effacer devant le pouvoir des foules. Elle possède certes une puissance considérable, mais seulement parce qu'elle est exclusivement le reflet des opinions des foules et de leurs incessantes variations. Devenue simple agence d'information, elle a renoncé à chercher à imposer aucune idée, aucune doctrine. Elle suit tous les changements de la pensée publique, et les nécessités de la concurrence l'obligent à bien les suivre sous peine de perdre ses lecteurs. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Où serait aujourd'hui le journal assez riche pour permettre à ses rédacteurs des opinions personnelles, et de quel poids seraient ces opinions auprès de lecteurs qui ne demandent qu'à être renseignés ou amusés, et qui, derrière chaque recommandation, redoutent toujours le spéculateur. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	press stands preeminent among the various institutions which are commonly designated as leaders or molders of the public mind. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	the man who is outside the current of prevailing public opinion should regard the daily press as a coercive force. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	the daily press and the other leading forces merely accept, reflect and intensify established public opinion and are, therefore, responsible for the uniformity of public reaction. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	He says:1 “The modern man has in the printing press a wonderfully effective means for perpetuating crowd-movements and keeping great masses of people constantly under the sway of certain crowd-ideas. Every crowd-group has its magazines, press agents, and special ‘literature’ with which it continually harangues its members and possible converts. Many books, and especially certain works of fiction of the ‘best seller’ type, are clearly reading mob phenomena.” (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	Naturally the press, like other institutions which present facts or opinions, is restricted, often unconsciously, sometimes consciously, by various controlling conditions. Certain people talk of the censorship enacted by the prejudices and predispositions of the public itself. Some, such as Upton Sinclair, ascribe to the advertisers a conscious and powerful control of publications. Others, like Walter Lippmann, find that an effective barrier between the public and the event exists in the powerful influence which, he says, is exerted in certain cases on the press by the so-called quality public which the newspapers’ advertisers which to reach and among whom the newspapers must circulate if the advertising is to be successful. Mr. Lippmann observes that although such a restriction may exist, much of what may be attributed to censorship in the newspaper, often is actually inadequate presentation of the events it seeks to describe. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	The public and the press, or for that matter, the public and any force that modifies pubic opinion, interact. Action and interaction are continually going on between the forces projected out to the public and the public itself. The public relations counsel must understand this fact in its broadest and most detailed implications. He must understand not only what these various forces are, but he must be able to evaluate their relative powers with fair accuracy. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	The truth is that while it appears to be forming the public opinion on fundamental matters, the press is often conforming to it. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	Ralph Pulitzer nevertheless agrees with Mr. Mencken that the opinion of the press is set by the public; and he justifies “muckraking”2 by finding it neither “extraordinary nor culpable that people and press should be more interested in the polemical than in the platitudinous; in blame than in painting the lily; in attack than in sending laudatory coals to Newcastle.” (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	of the modern press on its less commendable side, we are bound to admit that newspapers, like governments, fairly reflect the people they serve. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	“The editor does not nonchalantly project his thoughts into the void. He listens for the echo of his words. His reaction to his supporters is not unlike Gladstone’s definition of the intimate connection between the orator and his audience. As the speaker gets from his hearers in mist what he gives back in shower, so the newspaper receives from the public as well as it gives back to it. Too often it gets as dust what it gives back as mud; but that does not alter the relations. Action and reaction are all the while going on between the press and its patrons. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	What they want and what they get are fused by some mysterious alchemy. The press, the lecturer, the screen and the public lead and are led by each other. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	many splendid newspapers have accomplished as leaders in public movements. The New York Evening Post is another example, it having long led popular demand for vocational guidance and control. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	The standards of fitness created in the minds of the publishers express the point of view of a mass of readers, and this enables the newspapers to achieve and maintain circulation and financial success. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	In the press there is a very human tendency to compromise between giving the public what it wants and giving the public what it should want. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
Press release
	•	Usually, when companies face crisis situations, they use different public relations materials to overcome them. Among these materials, the press release is primarily used to inform the public through the news media of what the company is doing, and how they are going to resolve the crisis situation (Choi & Park, 2011) (Choi, 2012)
	•	public relations professionals play active roles in using and constructing press releases for desired public relations effects (Reber & Berger, 2005). (Choi, 2012)
Preparedness
	•	For the UN, preparedness is the “activity designed to minimize loss of life and damage, to organize the temporary removal of people and property from a threatened location and facilitate timely and effective rescue, relief and rehabilitaiton” (UN DHA, 1992) or “the knowledge and capacities developed by governments, professional response and recovery organizations, communities, and individuals to effectively anticipate, respond to, and recover from, the impact of likely, imminent, or current hazard events or conditions” (UN ISDR, 2009, p. 9). (Newsome, 2013)
	•	For U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) (1992) preparedness is “those activities, programs, and systems that exist prior to an emergency that are used to support and enhance response to an emergency or disaster.” (Newsome, 2013)
	•	For U.S. DHS (2009), preparedness is the “activities necessary to build, sustain, and improve readiness capabiliites to prevent, protect against, respond to, and revocer from natural or manmade incidents. Preparedness is a continuous process involving efforts at all levels of government and between government and the private sector and nongovernmental organizations to identify threats, determine vulnerabilities, and identify required resources to prevent, respond to, and recover from major incidents. (p. 110). (Newsome, 2013)
	•	For the British CIviln Contingencies Secretariat, preparedness is the “process of preparing to deal with known risks and unforeseen events or situations that have the potential to result in an emergency” (U.K. Cabinet Office, 2013). (Newsome, 2013)
Preventing action
Theory of preventive action
	•	theory of preventive action that helps explain why intelligence can in some cases succeed—and in other cases fail—to foresee and prevent surprise attacks. (Dahl, 2013)
	•	theory of preventive action: For intelligence to be actionable and usable in preventing surprise attacks, it must provide precise, tactical-level warning, and it must be combined with a high level of receptivity toward that warning on the part of policymakers who decide how and whether to use it. (Dahl, 2013)
	•	In order for intelligence to be actionable and usable in preventing surprise attacks, it must provide precise, tactical-level warn- ing, and it must be combined with a high level of receptivity toward that warning on the part of policymakers who will decide how and whether to use it. (Dahl, 2013)
	•	If intelligence authorities are able to develop specific, tactical-level intelligence, and if policymakers believe the threat and trust the intelligence, then surprise attacks are more likely to be disrupted. But if these two conditions do not exist, then it is highly unlikely that a well-planned major surprise attack will be disrupted. (Dahl, 2013)
Preventing a fatality
	•	VPF is not the value that society, or the courts, might put on the life of a real person or the compensation appropriate to its loss. (Great Britain and Health and Safety Executive, 2001)
Principal Component Analysis
	•	Data reduction algorithms, such as Principal Component Analysis (demonstrated and explained later in the chapter), can reduce the number of attributes without a significant loss in information. (Haider, 2016)
Probabilistic Safety Analysis 
	•	techniques have gradually been developed for assessing the probability and consequences of failures and otherevents that could lead to accidental releases from nuclear and other forms of plant. (Great Britain and Health and Safety Executive, 1992)
	•	A Probabilistic Safety Analysis (PSA) of a design begins with a careful identification of so called 'initiating events', that is, the things that could fail or go wrong and lead either directly or through a succession of other events, possibly including human error to a release of radioactivity. All the events that can be imagined and their possibleconsequencesareplottedintheformof logical sequences called 'fault' or 'event' trees. Many thousands of these are plotted and considered for every nuclear plant design. (Great Britain and Health and Safety Executive, 1992)
	•	Systematic attention is then given to the means of preventing any of the possible sequences developing to the point where an important failure would cause a release. The availability of extensive data on the reliability or integrity of particular items of plant enables the chance of failures to be broadly estimated with a fair degree of confidence; as also the chance of failure of any safety precaution built in.
	•	This approach enables the assessors and the designers themselves to ask a series of 'what if?' questions and also to consider when they should be satisfied with the answers, that is, when the chance of any of the fault sequences which could result in an accident has been driven low enough by provisions in the design. (Great Britain and Health and Safety Executive, 1992)
	•	PSA also helps the designers to produce a plant that is balanced from the safety point of view. The aim must be and is to reduce all important risks to some level of acceptability. Finally, it becomes possible to put an overall figure to the whole set, so that licensees can demonstrate that they have met whatever safety goals have been set for the plant as a whole. (Great Britain and Health and Safety Executive, 1992)
Product tampering
	•	product tampering produces very weak attributions of personal control and very strong attributions of external control. (Coombs, 1998)
	•	Both natural disasters and product tampering generate very weak perceptions of crisis responsibility (Coombs et al.,1995). (Coombs, 1998)
Process
	•	A process is a series of actions or activities toward some end. (Newsome, 2013)
Standard process
	•	A standard process also helps interoperability and communications between personnel and organizations. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Standard processes are usually communicated visually as a list, series, or cycle of steps. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	As far as I know, all standard processes have at least three steps. For instance, British government has defined risk management with three steps (identifying, assessing, and responding to risks), although it has prescribed processes with four to six higher steps and much explanatory text on the lower steps and activities (U.K. Treasury, 2004, pp. 9, 13). (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Illustrating the inconsistencies within U.S. government, the DHS (2009, p. 111) recognizes a risk management framework as a “planning methodology that outiles the process” in six effective steps. (Newsome, 2013)
Procedure
	•	Procedures refine themselves by going through endless mutate-select cycles, all with one end in mind: improving the return on your investment. (Coker, 2009)
Professional deformation
	•	when problems are many and diverse, on any one of them the number of experts can be dangerously small, and individual even idiosyncratic views may pass unchallenged, or there may be a défor- mation professionelle, a tendency to look at things according to the conventions of one’s own specialization or profession, forgetting any broader point of view. (Omand, 2014)
Progress
	•	If history, however, is a story of rapid, accumulating change it is mis- leading to call this Progress. ‘Progress’ itself is something of a cultural construction, in its present form an Enlightenment concept which over the last two centuries has been translated into an ideology of life. It found particularly strong expression in Kant’s ‘hidden plan’ and even Adam Smith’s championship of the middle class as the vanguard of a superior economic and moral order. Its most sublime expression is Hegel’s belief that history is the story of freedom becoming conscious of itself. (Coker, 2009)
Protection
	•	For the U.S. DHS (2009), protection is the “actions or measures taken to cover or shield from exposure, injury, or destruction. In the context of the NIPP [National Infrastructure Protection Plan], protection includes actions to deter the threat, mitigate the vulnerabilities, or minizme the consequences associated with a terrorist attack or other incident”. (Newsome, 2013)
Protection approach
	•	For the Humanitarian Practice Network (2010, pp. xvii, 55, 71) the protection approach is “a securitu strategy” or “approach to security” that “emphasized the use of protective devices and procedures to reduce vulnerability to existing threats, but does not affect the level of threat.”. (Newsome, 2013)
Balanced protection
	•	Another security strategy is the concept of balanced protection, which simply means that no matter how an adversary attempts to reach the asset, security measures that deter, detect, or delay his advance will be encountered. Balanced protection is accomplished through yet another security strategy called protection in depth. (Vellani, 2007)
Protection in depth
	•	Protection in depth is also known as security layering wherein the asset is behind multiple layers of security measures, each requiring penetration in sequence to reach the asset. (Vellani, 2007)

Civil protection
	•	For the British Civil Contingencies Secretariat, civil protection is “organization and measures, under governmental or other authoritiy, aimed at preventing, abating or otherwise countering the effects of emergencies for the protection of the civilian population and property” (U.K. Cabinet Office, 2013). (Newsome, 2013)
Asset protection
	•	Another strategy used in the pro- tection of assets is to provide protection only for critical assets, with the antic- ipation that other assets will be secured through a diffusion of benefits. (Vellani, 2007)
Projection (psychology)
	•	Projections have a positive role to play in your life, and you could not stop them even if you wanted to, because they are so automatic and unconscious. Without them, you would not find yourself paying deep attention to a person, becoming fascinated with him or her, idealizing, and falling in love. But once the relationship develops, you need to have the power and awareness to withdraw the projections, so that you can begin to see women and men as they reallyare. In doing so, perhaps you will realize how truly incompatible you are, or the opposite. Once connected to the real person, you can continue to idealize him or her, but this will be based on actual positive qualities he or she possesses. Perhaps you can find his or her faults charming. You can accomplish all of this by becoming aware of your own patterns and the types of qualities you tend to project onto others. (Greene, 2018)
Protest
	•	Protest may be less against specific technological decisions than against the declining capacity of citizens to shape policies that affect their interest; less against science than against the use of scientific rhetoric to mast political or moral choices. Today, many of the public protests against science and technology are driven by moral outrage and are assuming an increasingly strident tone. (Nelkin, 1992)
Providence
	•	Quelle a donc été l'intention de la Providence en abaissant l'homme qu'elle avait élevé et en élevant celui qu'elle avait abaissé. (Dumas, 1998)
Price of life 
	•	A life is worth roughly $300,000, one study concluded;5 less if you are over sixty, even less if you are otherwise enfeebled. After taking into account age and potential earning power, a life is a life (Perrow, 1999)
	•	In a large-scale cost-effectiveness analysis by Tengs et al. (1995), enormous variation was found in the cost of saving one year of life for 587 different life-saving interventions in the United States. For example, the median medical intervention costs about $19,000/life-year, the median injury reduction intervention costs 48,000/life- year, and the median toxin control intervention costs $2,800,000/life-year (see Table 5.6). Such differences in cost-effectiveness data are important because where there are investment inequalities, more lives could be saved by shifting resources (Tengs et at, 1995). (Williams and Paustenbach, 2002)
	•	A life lost or injured has financial value in insurance and the tort system (although insurance or legal liability would not be engaged in every case). (Newsome, 2013)
Private good
	•	private goods have the following characteristics. First, no more than one person can use the private goods at the same time because the process of using the goods is a private process. Second, the private goods cannot be used unless a reward is paid. Third, the users can ordinarily decide whether they use the private goods or not and the degree to which they use them (Torriti and Ikpeb, 2014)
Private property
	•	Private property is basic to a market economy since a market is a method of exchanging property rights (Douglas, 2005:141)
Proper
	•	Proper are shared techniques, agreed standards, stereotyped modes of behaviour, all that is recognized as correct and formal (Douglas, 2005:134)
Property rights
	•	property rights are by their nature restrictive and the tension within the market is between the restrictions that can be allowed and those that cannot (Douglas, 2005:141)
Pro-risk index
	•	[…] pro-risk index assesses whether risk taking and risk management are viewed as opportunities for advancement, or rather as invitations tocatastrophe at the societal level. (Wildavsky and Dake, 1990)
Proximity principle
	•	states that the more similar two individuals are, the more likely they will become friends. (Hassan et al., 2011)
	•	The “proximity principle” indicates that the more similar two individuals are, the more likely they will meet and become friends. (Hassan et al., 2011)
	•	Similarity, proximity, or friendship is vague or blurry categories, because they do not have clear edges. (Hassan et al., 2011)
	•	this basic mechanism is formalised by proposing a logistic function, which allows to model over time the process by which strangers become acquaintances, and acquaintances are converted to friends and potentially to partners. (Hassan et al., 2011)
	•	This idea is based on the the “proximity principle,” which states that the more similar two individuals are, the stronger their chances of becoming friends are (for a throughout sociological analysis, see Section 5.1). Thus, the chances of two neighbours of becoming friends are directly proportional to their similarity. Moreover, if friendship is considered a gradual relationship, the more similar two agents are, the better friends they will become over time. (Hassan et al., 2011)
Psychologist
	•	Psychologists study social relations by describing the behaviour of each social actor in his or her circle. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
Q
Quality-control
	•	Quality-control and peer-review procedures are particularly important when new approaches are introduced into the risk-assessment process. (National Research Council (U.S.) et al., 2009)
Qualitative data 
	•	[…] qualitative data provide a deep understanding of survey responses. (Driscoll et al., 2007)
Qualitative interview
	•	Qualitative interview, no differently from surveys, attempt to collect data by asking people questions pursuing, however, the typical goal of qualitative research of exploring the interviewee’s individuality and seeing the world though his eyes. (Corbetta, 2003)
	•	The qualitative interview can be seen as the verbal counterpart to participant observation, the former involving questioning and the latter involving observing. (Corbetta, 2003)
	•	[…] its basic objective remains that of grasping the subject’s perspective (Corbetta, 2003)
	•	The qualitative interview does not simply involve recording information; it is a process of social interaction between two individuals. (Corbetta, 2003)
	•	In qualitative interviews, the lack of standardization is both a strenght and a weakness. (Corbetta, 2003)
	•	[…] the qualitative interview is not an ordinary conversation, a normal dialogue between two evenly-matched individuals; rather, it is a guided conversation in which the interviewer establishes the topic and ensures that the interview is conducted according to the cognitive aims set. The interviewer may impart guidance at various degrees, but will substantially allow the interviewee to structure his answer, or even the entire conversation, as she things fit (unlike the case of the survey and the questionnaire) (Corbetta, 2003)
Qualitative research
	•	qualitative research, which springs from the interpretative paradigm, there is an open, interactive relationship between theory and research. The researcher often deliberately avoids formulating theories before fieldwork begins, on the grounds that this might hinder his capacity to ‘comprehend’ the point of view of the subject studies. Theoretical elaboration and empirical research are therefore intertwined. (Corbetta, 2003)
	•	[…] the qualitative researcher tries to get as deep inside the subject as possible, in an attempt to see social reality ‘through the eyes of the subject studies’. To do so, he can never remain neutral or indifferent, but instead will tend to identify empathetically with the subject. (Corbetta, 2003)
	•	On the qualitative side, by contrast, research is conceived of as ‘interaction’, which naturally implies an active role on the part of the subject studied. The subject’s direct, creative participation in the research process, far from being shunned, is actively sought […] (Corbetta, 2003)
	•	[…] the qualitative researcher, who gives priority to comprehension, even at the cost of pursuing atypical situations and non-generalizable mechanisms. (Corbetta, 2003)
	•	Qualitative research does not aim for this standardization. On the contrary, the heterogeneity of information, as we have seen, is a constituent element of this type of research, since the researcher records different information according to the cases, and at different levels of depth according to his judgment. (Corbetta, 2003)
	•	In qualitative research, by contrast, the issue of the objectivity and standardization of data does not arise; what counts is their wealth and depth. Data produced by qualitative research are termed soft, as opposed to the hard data mentioned earlier. (Corbetta, 2003)
	•	[…] qualitative analysis, in which there is no statistical-mathematical apparatus and the contribution of information technology (if any) is limited to the organization of empirical material. (Corbetta, 2003)
	•	Qualitative research […]. The object of the analysis is not the variable, but the entire individual. (Corbetta, 2003)
	•	Qualitative research is case-based (Corbetta, 2003)
	•	[…] the qualitative studies illustrated here, no attempt is made to investigate the causal mechanisms that lead to the differences in attitudes, behaviours and lifestyles observed among the subjects during the course of data analysis. (Corbetta, 2003)
	•	qualitative research asks how (Corbetta, 2003)
	•	As qualitative research necessitates in-depth investigation and identification with the object studied it cannot handle large numbers of cases (Corbetta, 2003)
	•	[…] in qualitative research, we should speak not so much of ‘techniques’ or ‘stages’ as of a ‘process’ of research. They maintain ‘… that qualitative research cannot be reduced to particular techniques nor to set stages, but rather that a dynamic process is involved which links together problems, theories and methods’. Consequently, ‘the research process is not a clear-cut sequence of procedures following a neat pattern, but a messy interaction between the conception and empirical world, deduction and induction occurring at the same time’ (Bechhofer, 1974: 73, quoted in Bryman and Burgess, 1994) (Corbetta, 2003)
	•	[…] the process of qualitative research lacks the linearity normally seen in quantitative research is beyond doubt. (Corbetta, 2003)
	•	The qualitative approach is holistic, in that the individual is observed and studied as a complete entity, in the conviction that each human being (like each social phenomenon) is more than the sum of a collection of parts (in this case, the variables). (Corbetta, 2003)
	•	Qualitative research is an approach for exploring and understanding the meaning individuals or groups ascribe to a social or human problem. The process of research involves emerging questions and procedures, data typically collected in the participant’s setting, data analysis inductively building from particulars to general themes, and the researcher making interpretations of the meaning of the data. The final written report has a flexible structure. Those who engage in this form of inquiry support a way of looking at research that honors an inductive style, a focus on individual meaning, and the importance of rendering the complexity of a situation. (Creswell, 2013)
Qualitizing
	•	qualitizing to describe the process of converting quantitative data to qualitative data (Tashakkori and Teddlie 1998: 126) (Driscoll et al., 2007)
Quantal-response model
	•	A quantal-response model currently in wide use by regulatory agencies, (Moolgavkar and Leubeck, 2002)
	•	The quantal-response models can be fit to data using the maximum- likelihood principle provided that the number of dose groups is larger than the number of unknown parameters. The likelihood of the data, which is bino- mial, is the product of individual Bernoulli terms contributed by each animal (Krewski and Van Ryzin, 1981; Moolgavkar ct al., 1999a). (Moolgavkar and Leubeck, 2002)
Quantum
	•	Symmetries organize quantum fields, and therefore the particles associated with them. (Stewart, 2013)
Quantitative research
	•	quantitative research inspired by the neopositivist paradigm, this relationship is structured in logically sequential phases, according to a substantially deductive approach (theory precedes observations) that strives to ‘justify’ that is to say, to support the previously formulated theory with empirical data. Within this framework, systematic analysis of the literature takes on a crucial role, since it is this that provides the theoretical hypotheses on which fieldwork will be based (Corbetta, 2003)
	•	In quantitative research, observation is carried out from a position that is external to the subject studied, just as the ‘scientific’ observer adopts a neutral, detached stance. Moreover, the researcher focuses on what he (or the scientific community) considers to be important. (Corbetta, 2003)
	•	Quantitative research does not envision any physical contact between the researcher and the subject. (Corbetta, 2003)
	•	From a quantitative standpoint, the subject studied is regarded as being passive, and even when he cannot be regarded as such, every effort is made to reduce his interaction with the researcher to a minimum. Research is conceived of as ‘observation’ and ‘recording’, and this implies looking at the individuals studied as objects (this takes us back to the original positivist conception of social facts as ‘things’).
	•	The quantitative researcher is concerned with the generalizability of the results (we will return to this issue later), and the use of a statistically representative sample is the most evident manifestation of this concern; indeed, we might say that the researcher is more concerned with the representativeness of the slice of society that he is studying than with his ability to comprehend it. (Corbetta, 2003)
	•	In any case, quantitative research always strives to produce hard data; for instance, to assess attitudes towards some political personality, respondents might be asked to give the person a score from 0 to 100 (to gauge the warmth of approval by means of a sort of ‘feeling thermometer’) (Corbetta, 2003)
	•	Quantitative research makes ample use of mathematical and statistical tools, together with a whole array of tables, graphs, statistical tests, etc., as well as the full set of technological equipment (computers, files, data banks, software, etc.) (Corbetta, 2003)
	•	Quantitative research is variable-based (Corbetta, 2003)
	•	[…] quantitative research; through the study of the relationships among variables, it brings the researcher to the enunciation of causal relationships among the variables themselves. (Corbetta, 2003)
	•	quantitative research asks why (Corbetta, 2003)
	•	[…] quantitative research is to identify the causal mechanism (Corbetta, 2003)
	•	[…] the quantitative researcher will nevertheless be guided by the logic of the cause-effect mechanism (Corbetta, 2003)
	•	In sum, quantitative research findings are undoubtedly more generalizable than those of qualitative research. (Corbetta, 2003)
	•	By contrast, quantitative analysis, even if primary data are used, necessitates imposing a degree of uniformity on variables that removes nuances of interpretation and understanding. (Davies et al., 2002)
	•	Quantitative research is an approach for testing objective theories by examining the relationship among variables. These variables, in turn, can be measured, typically on instruments, so that numbered data can be analysed using statistical procedures. The final written report has a set structure consisting of introduction, literature, and theory, methods, results, and discussion. Like qualitative researchers, those who engage in this form of inquiry have assumptions about testing theories deductively, building in protections against bias, controlling for alternative explanations, and being able to generalize and replicate the findings. (Creswell, 2013)
Quantitizing
	•	The term quantitizing has been coined to describe the process of transforming coded qualitative data into quantitative data (Driscoll et al., 2007)
R
Race
	•	Race (the speed of means of communicating destruction) (Virilio, 2006)
Radon
	•	Radon is a colorless, odorless gas that seeps into homes from the soil. It can also come from private well water containing radon and, rarely, from radium-rich building materials. (Atman et al., 1994)
Reaction time
	•	Reaction time is the time that it would take, given a current state of preparations, to attain the capability required to reduce a risk or avert an attack. Reaction time is thus determined by three factors: the level of capability that will be required after warning, the readiness at whichcapability and forces are kept in the present, and the speed with which readiness can be raised. (Frühling, 2014)
	•	Reducing reaction time through maintaining highoperational readiness can reduce the severity of a possible strategic surprise. (Frühling, 2014)
Raison d’État
	•	The notion of raison d’état is one example of such a means-ends rationality. The state is assumed to have certain interests. The realisation of these interests depends on its means, or capabilities, and the capabilities of other states. The outcome, and the way it comes to constitute the international system (for example, as a bipolarity), is calculated on the basis of the balance of capabilities. The ends, the interests, are not to be calculated, but are considered as universal ‘givens’. States have different interests only insofar as they have different means to pursue them. (Rasmussen, 2001)
Random process
	•	We do not expect to see regularity produced by a random process, and when we detect what appears to be a rule, we quickly reject the idea that the process is truly random. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	Random processes produce many sequences that convince people that the process is not random after all. (Kahneman, 2012)
Randomness
	•	The widespread misunderstanding of randomness sometimes has significant consequences (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	The illusion of pattern affects our lives in many ways (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	randomness is a property of the process that generates the data that are produced. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Randomness may in some cases be demonstrated by scientific (statistical) analysis. (Heuer, 1999)
Ratio
Odds ratio
	•	Odds ratios are often preferable, as most people have a better intuitive understanding of odds than of percentages. (Heuer, 1999)
Rational
	•	The word rational conveys an image of greater deliberation, more calculation, and less warmth, but in common language a rational person is certainly reasonable. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	Clearly the words rational and irrational can be quite loaded. People are always labeling those who disagree with them “irrational.” (Greene, 2018)
	•	This deep understanding of ourselves and our vulnerabilities is a key step toward becoming rational. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Being able to tame the Emotional Self leads to an overall calmness and clarity. In this state of mind you are less consumed by petty conflicts and considerations. Your actions are more effective, which also leads to less turmoil. You have the immense satisfaction of mastering yourself in a deep way. You have more mental space to be creative. You feel more in control. (Greene, 2018)
Rational people
	•	We constantly feel emotions, and they continually infect our thinking, making us veer toward thoughts that please us and soothe our egos. It is impossible to not have our inclinations and feelings somehow involved in what we think. Rational people are aware of this and through introspection and effort are able, to some extent, to subtract emotions from their thinking and counteract their effect. Irrational people have no such awareness. They rush into action without carefully considering the ramifications and consequences. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Rational people demonstrate over time that they are able to finish a project, to realize their goals, to work effectively with a team, and to create something that lasts. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Rational people can readily admit their own irrational tendencies and the need to be vigilant. (Greene, 2018)
	•	The Emotional Self thrives on ignorance. The moment you are aware of how it operates and dominates you is the moment it loses its hold on you and can be tamed. Therefore, your first step toward the rational is always inward. You want to catch that Emotional Self in action. (Greene, 2018)
Rationalism
Critical rationalism
	•	Critical rationalism is either a meaningful idea or a collection of slogans (such as "truth"; "professional integrity"; "intellectual honesty") designed to intimidate yellow-bellied opponents (who has the fortitude, or even the insight, to declare that Truth might be unimportant, and perhaps even undesirable?). (Feyerabend, 1993)
Rationality
	•	Rationality means the requirement that any claim be supported by reasons (Douglas, 2005:135)
	•	It is convenient to think of three forms of rationality: absolute rationality, which is enjoyed primarily by economists and engineers; "bounded" or limited rationality, which a growing wing of risk assessors emphasize; and what I will call social and cultural rationality, which is what most of us live by, although without thinking that much about it. (Perrow, 1999)
	•	A technology that produces confusion, deception, uncertainty, and incomprehensible events (as the crisis over the several days did) is to be avoided. The technology affects social bonding and social interaction, and individual psyches and peace of mind. (Perrow, 1999)
	•	Cost-benefit analysis emphasizes the first; risk assessors are increasingly moving from the first to the second (Perrow, 1999)
	•	Stanovich’s concept of a rational person is similar to what I earlier labeled “engaged.” The core of his argument is that rationality should be distinguished from intelligence. In his view, superficial or “lazy” thinking is a flaw in the reflective mind, a failure of rationality. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	Rationality is logical coherence—reasonable or not. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	we humans have come to recognize only one form of thinking and intelligence-rationality. (Greene, 2014)
	•	Like everyone, you think you are rational, but you are not. Rationality is not a power you are born with but one you acquire through training and practice. (Greene, 2018)
	•	At any moment this can change with a simple decision—to cultivate your inner Athena. Rationality is then what you will value the most and that which will serve as your guide. (Greene, 2018)
	•	The first step toward becoming rational is to understand our fundamental irrationality. There are two factors that should render this more palatable to our egos: obody is exempt from the irresistible effect of emotions on the mind, not even the wisest among us; and to some extent irrationality is a function of the structure of our brains and is wired into our very nature by the way we process emotions. Being irrational is almost beyond our control. (Greene, 2018)
	•	rationality is not some means of transcending emotion. (Greene, 2018)
	•	to acquire rationality is not complicated. It simply requires knowing and working through a three-step process. First, we must become aware of what shall call low-grade irrationality (…) Second, we must understand the nature of what we shall call high-grade irrationality (…) Third, we need to enact certain strategies and exercices that will strengthen the thinking part of the brain and give it more power in the eternal struggle with our emotions. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Rationality and ethical qualities must be achieved through awareness and effort. They do not come naturally. They come through a maturation process. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Rationality is something to be acquired by individuals, not by mass movements or technological progress. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Instead of being slaves to this energy, we channel it. That is the essence of rationality. (Greene, 2018)
	•	It is important to not see the path to rationality as something painful and ascetic. (Greene, 2018)
	•	"Rationality" thus has both instrumental and symbolic functions: organizations use it to fix problems and they use it to persuade others that they can fix problems. (Clarke, 1999)
	•	these standards are standards of criticism: rational discussion consists in the attempt to criticize, and not in the attempt to prove, or to make probable. Every step that protects a view from criticism, that makes it safe, or "well founded,'' is a step away from rationality. (Feyerabend, 1993)
Absolute rationality
	•	Absolute rationality we have encountered in the description of risk assessors' wherein calculations can be made about risks and benefits, clearly showing which activities we should prefer—such as nuclear power over coal-fired power plants. (Perrow, 1999)
	•	economic or absolute rationality, which requires narrow, quantitative and precise goals (Perrow, 1999)
Bounded rationality
	•	The limits on our ability to consistently and easily make fully rational decisions might be due in part to neurological limitation, to limits on memory and attention, to lack of education, and to lack of training in probabilities and statistics (Perrow, 1999)
	•	bounded rationality is efficient because it avoids an extensive amount of effort. (Perrow, 1999)
	•	The public's fears must be treated with respect, and a way found to bring them into policy consideration, the bounded rationalists would say. (Perrow, 1999)
	•	Our limitations bring about social bonding. Bonding by diversity in skills (which is related to limitations in cognition, incidentally) is more stable and perhaps more satisfying than bonding by addition of equal talents. (Perrow, 1999)
	•	limits on every human make domination of the many by the few more difficult. (Perrow, 1999)
	•	bounded rationality, which emphasizes the limits on our thinking capacities and our inability to often achieve or even seek absolute rationality (Perrow, 1999)
	•	The bounded rationality viewpoint has had a tremendous impact upon organizational theory. (Perrow, 1999)

Social and culture rationality
	•	First, heuristics prevent a paralysis of decision making; they prevent agonizing over every possible contingency that might occur. Second, they drastically cut down on the "costs of search," the time and effort to examine all possible choices and then to try to rank them precisely in terms of their costs and benefits. Third, they undergo revision, perhaps slowly, as repeated trials led to corrections of hunches and rules o thumb, and do so without expensive conscious effort. Finally, I think, they facilitate social life by giving others a good estimate of what we are likely to do, since we appear to share these heuristics widely. (Perrow, 1999)
	•	social and cultural rationality (or social rationality for short), departs from the absolute rationality of the risk assessors and economists even more significantly than bounded rationality does. (Perrow, 1999)
	•	we might be thankful for our limited cognitive abilities. People vary in their cognitive abilities in absolute terms, but they also seem to vary with respect to different thinking abilities for different tasks. (Perrow, 1999)
	•	social and cultural rationality, which emphasizes diversity and social bonding (Perrow, 1999)
Standard of rationality
	•	In the former case it must be possible to produce rules, standards, restrictions which permit us to separate critical behavior (thinking, singing, writing of plays) from other types of behavior so that we can discover irrational actions and correct them with the help of concrete suggestions. It is not difficult to produce the standards of rationality defended by the Popperian school. (Feyerabend, 1993)
	•	These standards are standards of criticism: rational discussion consists in the attempt to criticize, and not in the attempt to prove, or to make probable. Every step that protects a view from criticism, that makes it safe, or "well founded,'' is a step away from rationality. (Feyerabend, 1993)
Means-ends rationality
	•	Weber held that in modernity humans defined their being in terms of means-ends rationality, which he defined as the determination of action ‘by expectations as to the behaviour of objects in the environment and of other human beings; these expectations are used as “conditions” or “means” for the attainment of the actor’s own rationally pursued and calculated ends’. (Rasmussen, 2001)
	•	The reason for being, means-ends rationality held, was to be found in Reason. (Rasmussen, 2001)
	•	The reason for acting was not an individual matter, as in the case of affectual or value rationality. (Rasmussen, 2001)
	•	The reasons for actions were universal and calculable. (Rasmussen, 2001)
	•	This meant that all subjects were basically alike and that action only differed because of the discrepancy in the means of carrying out ends, not in a discrepancy in the ends themselves. (Rasmussen, 2001)
	•	the demand for consistency and means-end coherence derives from our interest in getting what we want. (Bratman, 1981)
	•	Means-end coherence is stringent because when you believe that the means is necessary for the end, the full force of your subjective reason to pursue the end transmits to your subjective reason to pursue the means. (Schroeder, 2009)
	•	agent’s means-end belief is that the means are necessary for the end. (Schroeder, 2009)
Rational agent
	•	rational agent to which Herbert Simon brought his famous objection—someone with a mind like a calculating machine, sovereign in control of his own choices, decisive and consistent enough to give clear signals to partners (Douglas, 2005:142)
Rational actor theory
	•	rational actor theory, argues that the conduct, character, and creation of plans follow the demands of the task. (Clarke, 1999)
Rational individual
	•	The rational individual has to be conceived as one who expects to be held accountable, who therefore seeks approval, and who gives out praise and blame to others (Douglas, 2005:132)
Rigid rationalist
	•	Always being rational can be tiresome. But for some people, this makes them terribly uncomfortable. They experience this primitive thinking as softness, as mysticism, as contrary to science and technology. Everything must be clear and analytical in the extreme. They become devout atheists, not realizing that the concept of God cannot be proven or disproven. It is a belief either way. (Greene, 2018)
	•	The repressed, however, always return. Their faith in science and technology has a religious air to it. When it comes to an argument, they will impose their ideas with extra intellectual heft and even a touch of anger, which reveals the stirring of the primitive within and the hidden emotional need to bully.  (Greene, 2018)
	•	At the extreme, they will indulge in a love affair that is most irrational and contrary to their image—the professor running off with the young model. Or they will make some bad career choice, or fall for some ridiculous financial scheme, or indulge in some conspiracy theory. They are also prone to strange shifts in mood and emotional outbursts as the Shadow stirs. Bait them into just such overreactions to prick their bubble of intellectual superiority. (Greene, 2018)
True rationality
	•	True rationality should be sober and skeptical about its own powers and not publicize itself. (Greene, 2018)
Rationalisation
	•	"Rationalisation," as expressed in technology and in the organisation of human activities, in the shape of bureaucracy, is the keynote. (Giddens, 1991)
Rational capitalism
	•	"Rational capitalism" as Weber characterizes it, comprises the economic mechanisms specified by Marx, including the commodification of wage labour. (Giddens, 1991)
Rational regulation
	•	Rational regulation is be risk-based and focuses effort and resource on the most risky entities. (Power, 2009)
	•	'regulatory science' characterizes the continual process of construction of sociotechnical networks for risks, assemblages in a constant state of movement (Bougen and Young, 2000). (Power, 2009)
Rational thinking
	•	we humans have come to recognize only one form of thinking and intelligence-rationality. Rational thinking is sequential by nature. We see a phenomenon A, and we deduce a cause B, and maybe anticipate a reaction C. In all the cases of rational thiking, we can reconstruct the various steps that were taken to arrive at some kind of conclusion or answer. This form of thinking is extremelu effective and has brought us great powers. The process that people go through when they arrive at an answer through rational analysis can generally be examined and verified which is why we esteem it so highly. We prefer things that can be reduced to a formula and described in precise words. (Greene, 2014)
	•	because we recognize rationality as the only legitimate form of intelligence, these experiences of “seeing more” must either be forms of rational thinking that just happen faster, or are simply miraculous by nature. (Greene, 2014)
Rationalization of problems
	•	When organizations analyze problems, they try to transform uncertainties into risks, rationalizing problems previously outside the realm of systematic control. (Clarke, 1999)
	•	Organizations can thus be charged with the onerous task of effectively transforming uncertainty into risk even without a sufficient experiential base or conceptual scheme appropriate for interpreting history. This problem is especially critical for organizations whose failures may entail catastrophe. (Clarke, 1999)
Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation, and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) 
	•	Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation, and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) regulation entered into force, and Canada launched its new Chemicals Management Plan (CMP). (Abelkop and Graham, 2014)
	•	REACH, we found that the programe contains a variety of tools to facilitate or encourage substitution of worrisome chemicals. A registration process is employed to encourage replacement of worrisome chemicals, since a registrant may determine that it is not worthwhile to invest the resources to defend a suspect chemical in a registration process. (Abelkop and Graham, 2014)
	•	REACH charges industry substantial registration fees, including higher fees for chemicals that will require more in-depth review by government. (Abelkop and Graham, 2014)
	•	REACH also imposes minimum data requirements for existing chemicals. If producers lack such data, they may find it more cost-effective to register a substitute chemical that already has a complete data set and good safety characteristics. (Abelkop and Graham, 2014)
	•	the REACH registration system creates financial incentives for firms to replace hazardous chemicals with safer chemicals that can be registered at low cost. (Abelkop and Graham, 2014)
	•	One of the weaknesses we found in REACH’s registration system, though, is a degree of complexity and burden that was not necessary to achieve the law’s precautionary and protective goals. (Abelkop and Graham, 2014)
	•	REACH also establishes categories and/or lists of chemicals – such as ‘substances of very high concern’ (SVHC) – that serve as a tool of stigmatization that may stimulate market actors to replace a SVHC with another chemical. (Abelkop and Graham, 2014)
	•	REACH also compels a phase out of the chemical unless the industry can make a compelling safety or socio-economic case for continuation of specific uses. (Abelkop and Graham, 2014)
Reactive state
	•	reactive state—everything we see or hear is interpreted through the lens of this emotion. We become more sensitive and more prone to other emotional reactions. Impatience and resentment can bleed into anger and deep distrust. These reactive states are what lead people to violence, to manic obsessions, to uncontrollable greed, or to desires to control another person. This form of irrationality is the source of more acute problems—crises, conflicts, and disastrous decisions. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Understanding how this type of irrationality operates can allow us to recognize the reactive state as it is happening and pull back before we do something we regret. (Greene, 2018)
	•	The longer you can take the better, because perspective comes with time. Consider this like resistance training—the longer you can resist reacting, the more mental space you have for actual reflection, and the stronger your mind will become. (Greene, 2018)
	•	people tend to react and overreact to any negative or positive change in the present, and it becomes doubly hard to resist getting caught up in their panic or exuberance. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Not wanting to go too far in either direction, we mostly live within the present. We react to what we see and hear and to what others are reacting to. We live for immediate pleasures to distract us from the passage of time and make us feel more alive. But we pay a price for all this. Repressing the thought of death and aging creates a continual underlying anxiety. We are not coming to terms with reality. Continually reacting to events in the present puts us on a roller coaster ride—up and down we go with each change in fortune. This can only add to our anxiety, as life seems to pass so quickly in the immediate rush of events. (Greene, 2018)

Reader
Mass reader
	•	The standards of fitness created in the minds of the publishers express the point of view of a mass of readers, and this enables the newspapers to achieve and maintain circulation and financial success. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
Reality
	•	Reality is messy and the pieces rarely fit so perfectly. (Greene, 2018)
	•	When people lose the connection between their actions and their consequences, they lose their hold on reality, and the further this goes the more it looks like madness. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Looking back on our life, we see that we have a tendency to be impatient and to overreact; we notice patterns of behavior over long periods of time that elude us in the moment but become clearer to us later on. What this means is that in the present moment we lack perspective. With the passage of time, we gain more information and see more of the truth; what was invisible to us in the present now becomes visible in retrospect. Time is the greatest teacher of them all, the revealer of reality. (Greene, 2018)
	•	When we face any kind of problem or obstacle, we must follow his example and make an effort to slow things down and step back, wait a day or two before taking action. Second, when faced with issues that are important, we must have a clear sense of our long-term goals and how to attain them. Part of this involves assessing the relative strengths and weaknesses of the parties involved. Such clarity will allow us to withstand the constant emotional overreactions of those around us. Finally, it is important to have faith that time will eventually prove us right and to maintain our resolve. (Greene, 2018)
	•	We humans like to imagine that we have an objective knowledge of the world. We take it for granted that what we perceive on a daily basis is reality—this reality being more or less the same for everybody. But this is an illusion. No two people see or experience the world in the same way. What we perceive is our personal version of reality, one that is of our own creation. To realize this is a critical step in our understanding of human nature. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Each of us sees the world through a particular lens that colors and shapes our perceptions. Let us call this lens our attitude. (Greene, 2018)
	•	most people’s sense of reality was shaped by what he termed “pseudo-environments.”. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
Human reality
	•	Human reality encompasses the past—every event is connected to something that happened before in an endless chain of historical causation. Any present problem has deep roots in the past. It also encompasses the future. Whatever we do has consequences that stretch far into the years to come. (Greene, 2018)
Realism
Offensive realist
	•	offensive realist theory is to explain patterns of corporation - and not least conflict in the modern state system. (Toft, 2003)
	•	explain why great powers seemingly always strive for dominance and why this pattern of behaviour tragically is doomed to repeat itself fuelling relentless security competition and causing occasional great power wars (Toft, 2003)
Utopian realism
	•	utopian realism recognises the inevitability of power and does not see its use as inherently noxious. Power, in its broadest sense, is a means of getting things done. (Giddens, 1991)
	•	Anticipations of the future become part of the present, thereby rebounding upon how the future actually develops; (Giddens, 1991)
	•	utopian realism combines the "opening of windows" upon the future with the analysis of ongoing institutional trends whereby political futures are immanent in the present (Giddens, 1991)
Reasonable people
	•	Reasonable people cannot be rational by that definition, but they should not be branded as irrational for that reason. (Kahneman, 2012)
Reasoning
	•	Reasoning can rest on three methods of logical inference:deduction, induction and abduction. (Frühling, 2014)
	•	Deduction, induction and abduction differ in the logical inference they allow between three elements: a precondition or ‘case’ (for example, a vase thrown into the air), a causal chain or ‘rule’ (gravity) and the result (the vase in pieces on the floor). Case, rule and result are a ‘true’ combination in the sense that the rule applied to the case will lead to the result. (Frühling, 2014)
	•	Through reasoning, it is possible to infer one of the three elements from the existence of the other two – but the strength and nature of the conclusion that can be drawn will differ significantly between the three methods of inference. (Frühling, 2014)
Deduction
	•	Deduction uses a given case (a vase has been thrown into the air) and rule (gravity) to infer a result (the vase will break on the ground). If the case and the rule are true, the inferred result logically has to be true as well. (Frühling, 2014)
	•	Deduction is therefore the method of inference with the highest associated confidence. (Frühling, 2014)
	•	 it also requires that we have a good understanding of the current situation (the case), and of the ways in which it will develop (the rule). (Frühling, 2014)
	•	The strength of the logical conclusion comes at the cost of a high requirement for known information. (Frühling, 2014)
	•	deduction is the only method where the validity of the inferred result is not in doubt. (Frühling, 2014)
Reason
	•	Laissons donc la raison aux philosophes, mais ne lui demandons pas trop d'intervenir dans le gouvernement des hommes. Ce n'est pas avec la raison et c'est le plus souvent malgré elle, que se sont créés des sentiments tels que l'honneur, l'abnégation, la foi religieuse, l'amour de la gloire et de la patrie, qui ont été jusqu'ici les grands ressorts de toutes les civilisations. (Lebon, 1895)
Induction
	•	Induction uses the known case (a vase had been thrown into the air) and result (a vase now lies smashed on the ground) to infer a rule (there exists a force that has pulled the vase downwards, and caused it to break upon impact). (Frühling, 2014)
	•	In practical application, induction often involves large numbers of observations, and it is the logical inference on which probability theory is based. (Frühling, 2014)
	•	Induction is based on the assumption that like situations will lead to like results, and requires a measure of stability in the relationships that are examined. (Frühling, 2014)
Abdduction
	•	Abduction concludes from a rule (gravity) and a result (a broken vase on the floor) to the case that might have caused the observation (the vase may be broken because someone might have thrown it into the air). Abduction is the method of inference that underlies the formation of hypotheses, and the discovery of possibilities. (Frühling, 2014)
	•	it can only lead to a list of possible causes that may have led to the result, and it is impossible through abduction alone toestablish what, in reality, has happened (for example, someone may have broken the vase with a hammer). (Frühling, 2014)
	•	additional information – such as a whole set of identical vases broken on the floor – does not provide any greater certainty to the abductive conclusion of possible causes. (Frühling, 2014)
	•	discovery of additional rules – we might find out, for example, that an earthquake could have caused the damage – would even lead to lesser confidence in any one conclusion. (Frühling, 2014)
	•	By using abduction, it is still possible to infer from future situations that are to be avoided (the ‘results’), and possible causes that may lead to them (the ‘rules’), to the possible causes – and hence to what could be done to avoid them. (Frühling, 2014)
	•	abduction can determine the broad type of military forces that might be required. (Frühling, 2014)
	•	In an abductive framework, additional considerations are required to inform quantitative considerations. (Frühling, 2014)
	•	Abduction can thus be used to define a strategic risk without reference to any specific adversary that causes it. (Frühling, 2014)
	•	abductive reasoning can still help inform an assessment of residual ‘unknown unknowns’ in the strategic environment. (Frühling, 2014)
	•	It acknowledged that abductive reasoning ‘extrapolate[s] a program’s scope, scale, pace and direction beyond what the hardevidence at hand unequivocally supports’. (Frühling, 2014)
Relationship
	•	each side in a relationship continually shapes the other. A relationship has a life and personality all its own. And a relationship can also be deeply narcissistic, accentuating or even bringing out the narcissistic tendencies of both sides. (Greene, 2018)
Narcissic relationship
	•	What generally makes a relationship narcissistic is the lack of empathy that makes the partners retreat deeper and deeper into their own defensive positions. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Such use of empathy has the opposite effect of mutual narcissism. Coming from one side, it tends to soften the other one up and invite his or her empathy as well. It is hard to stay in one’s defensive position when the other person is seeing and expressing your side and entering your spirit. It beckons you to do the same. Secretly people yearn to let go of their resistance. It is exhausting to continually be so defensive and suspicious. (Greene, 2018)
	•	The key to employing empathy within a relationship is to understand the value system of the other person, which inevitably is different from yours. What they interpret as signs of love or attention or generosity tends to diverge from your way of thinking. These value systems are largely formed in early childhood and are not consciously created by people. Keeping in mind their value system will allow you to enter their spirit and perspective precisely in the moment you would normally turn defensive. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Measure all of your relationships on the narcissism spectrum. It is not one person or the other but the dynamic itself that must be altered. (Greene, 2018)
Recreancy
	•	Recreancy is defined by Freudenburg (2000) as “the failure of experts or specialized organizations to execute properly responsibilities to the broader collectivity with which they have been implicitly or explicitly entrusted” (p. 116). This concept directs our attention to issues of institutional trust, specifically to institutions entrusted to protect the public, “control” technology, and respond to crises. Applied to disasters, recreancy is linked to causes or “triggering events” (Freudenburg, 1997). (Gill et al., 2012)
	•	[…] it involves the failure of experts or specialized organizations to carry out the responsi- bilities to the broader collectivity with which they have been implicitly or explicitly entrusted. The word comes from the Latin roots re-(back) and credere (to entrust), and the technical use of the term is analogous to one of its two dictionary meanings, involving a retrogression or failure to follow through on a duty or a trust. The term is unfamiliar to most, but there is a simple reason for its use: we need a specialized word if we intend to refer to behaviors of institutions or organizations, as well as of individuals, and importantly, if the focus is to be on the facts instead of the emotions they inspire. (Freudenburg, 2003)
	•	While "recreancy" may not be an everyday term, the need for such a term grows out of the need to avoid the emotional and/or legal connotations of the available alternatives. (Freudenburg, 2003)
	•	recreancy proves to be far more important than most of the factors that have tended to be stressed in the many editorials that have been written, in recent years, about the mass media and the public. (Freudenburg, 2003)
Reccurence
	•	we can define coming back to mean returning closer to the current point than we have ever seen it return before. If this happens, then the trajectory is said to be recurrent. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
Redundancy
	•	redundancy – duplication and overlap in critical components and personnel – to produce improved safety (Sagan, 1995)
	•	redundant system are often less independent than their designers believe.
	•	Although redundant backups are supposed to be independent of one another, they also usually increase the interactive complexity of high-technology organizations and hence lead to unanticipated common-mode failures (Sagan, 1995)
	•	The normal accident perspective, in contrast, focuses attention on the potential negative consequences of redundancy and, indeed, maintains that adding redundant part to a complex technological system a can increase the likelihood of accidents […] (Sagan, 1995)
	•	Second, adding redundancy often makes the system more opaque: individual component or human failures will often be less visible, since they have been compensated for by overlap or backup devices. (Sagan, 1995)
	•	Third, when redundancy makes the system appear more safe, operators often take advantage of such improvements to move to higher and more dangerous production levels. (Sagan, 1995)
	•	Adding redundancy does not necessarily enhance reliability because it also increases interactive complexity, encourages operators to run more risks, and makes the overall system more opaque. (Sagan, 1995)
	•	redundancy introduces additional complexity and encourages risk taking. (Marais et al., 2004)
	•	the use of redundancy is not the only way to increase safety and many of the alternatives do not involve increasing complexity (Marais et al., 2004)
	•	Redundancy and the use of protection systems are among the least effective and the most costly approaches to designing for safety (Marais et al., 2004)
	•	Redundancy will not, generally, provide protection against inherent design faults, which would simply repeat themselves in every affected component. One way of tackling this is to provide back-up via dissimilar components, ie ones that have been designed independently; this approach is called 'design diversity'. (Great Britain and Health and Safety Executive, 1992)
	•	Redundancy inhibits consensus and impedes the herd instinct in the decision process, thus reducing the likelihood of failure due to unchallenged premises or cognitive errors. (Betts, 2007)
Referential meaning
	•	[…] referential meaning by which people indicate humans, objects, events or processes, with some (perceived) correspondence between the ‘content’ of what they say and ‘the world’ (Davies et al., 2002)

Reflexive
	•	Reflexive, he argues, has more to do with reflex than reflection. Reflexes are indeterminate. (Lash, 2003)
Reflexive modernity
	•	the ‘reflexivity of modernity’, which means not more research aimed at improving our knowledge of cause- effect relations and control of the world, but a process of reflection by which the foundations of modernity are questioned and revised. (Griner, 2002)
	•	Meaning has become an object of reflection. (Rasmussen, 2001)
Reflexive modernization
	•	Reflexive modernization is a phase of ‘active critique’ (Scott, 2000)
	•	[…] ‘reflexive modernization’ presumes the existence of two modernities: a ‘first’ or ‘simple modernity’, and the modernity at stake in this section of this issue of Theory, Culture & Society, which is a second, or ‘reflexive’ modernity. (Lash, 2003)
	•	reflexive modernity, if we are to follow Manuel Castells (1989), involves a logic of flows. (Lash, 2003)
	•	[…] modernity reflexivity is about the emergent demise of the distinction between structure and agency altogether. (Lash, 2003)
	•	reflexive modernity we are better educated, more knowledgeable than ever. Instead, the type of knowledge at stake changes. (Lash, 2003)
	•	Reflexive modernization, the Becks argue, is a question of ‘place-polygamy’. The point is that such place-polygamy is always necessarily technologically mediated, by cheaper air flights, by mobile phones, by microprocessors in various smart boxes, by protocols and channels enabling communication at a distance between individuals. (Lash, 2003)
	•	Reflexive modernization confronts and tries to accommodate the essential tension between human indeterminacy – as reflected in the incessant but always open attempt to renegotiate coherent narratives of identity – and the inevitable tendency to objectify and naturalize our institutional cultural productions (Lash and Wynne, 1992)
	•	Reflexive modernization means not less but more modernity, a modernity radicalized against the paths and categories of the classical industrial setting (Beck, 1992)
	•	The promise of security grows with the risks and destruction and must be reaffirmed over and over again to an alter a critical public through cosmetic or real interventions in the techno-economic development (Beck, 1992)
	•	The concept of risk is directly bound to the concept of reflexive modernization. Risk may be defined as a systematic way of dealing with hazards and insecurity induced and introduced by modernization itself (Beck, 1992)
	•	Reflexive modernisation, on the other hand, corresponds with a process of reflexivity as a reaction to the destructive excesses of modernity. (Griner, 2002)
	•	Modernity has become ‘reflexive’ because the identity of social subjects is no longer determined by means-ends rationality as a matter of course. (Rasmussen, 2001)

Reflexive politics
	•	I propose to utilise Beck’s theory in analysing three constitutive elements of reflexive politics: ‘management’, the ‘presence of the future’ and the ‘boomerang effect’.4 ‘Management’ describes how politics in reflexive modernity is no longer the pursuit of ends, but how governments are forced to take a position where they have to continuously construct new means in order to manage risks. The ‘presence of the future’ describes how scenarios for the future guide politics, as modern causal temporality breaks down in the face of proliferating risks. The ‘boomerang effect’ describes the breakdown of the distinction between ‘self’ and ‘other’. (Rasmussen, 2001)
Reflexive practice
	•	reflexive practice carry questionable assumptions about the way contemporary policy making works (Hendriks and Grin, 2007)
Reflexivity
	•	Reflexivity, Beck notes, is characterized by choice, where previous generations had no such choices. What Beck often omits to say is that this choice must be fast, we must – as in a reflex – make quick decisions. (Lash, 2003)
	•	‘to be reflexive’ is the capacity to turn or bend back on oneself (Hendriks and Grin, 2007)
	•	Griner argues that ‘the concept of reflexivity refers to the ability of all rational beings to take themselves as objects of knowledge, thus modifying their identity and/or behaviour’. (Rasmussen, 2004)
	•	Beck argues that reflexivity constitutes a new rationality in social affairs: ‘We are living in an age of constructivism’. (Rasmussen, 2004)
	•	‘reflexivity’ in the sense of social awareness of risks has been a constant characteristic of governmental processes. (Aradau and Van Munster, 2007)
	•	reflexivity is characteristic of all processes of governing the future, including security (Albert, 2001: 66–7). (Aradau and Van Munster, 2007)
	•	Reflexivity is a form of self-critique and self-transformation that emerges in the advent of uncontrollable risks. (Aradau and Van Munster, 2007)
	•	The concept of reflexivity refers to the ability of all rational beings to take themselves as objects of knowledge, thus modifying their identity and/or behaviour. (Griner, 2002)
	•	Reflexivity is characterised by a loss of control.51 Ends are no longer believed to be controlled by the means allocated to achieve them. Because of this lack of control of outcomes, taking a decision becomes a risk in itself. It becomes a risk because it is based on a scenario for the future; and it is risky because any reflective decision is in fact a choice between risks rather than a choice between a safe and unsafe policy. (Rasmussen, 2001)
	•	Crucial to Beck’s analysis is the Frankfurt School-Habermasian emphasis on reflexivity: risk societies are capable of understating themselves as constituted through ‘risk dynamics’, and hence of negotiating how best to meet the material and political consequences that arise from ‘everyday risk management’ as well as catastrophic risks. (Buzan and Hansen, 2009)
First-order reflexivity
	•	first-order reflexivity refers to the continuous cycle of side effects from simple modernity. Reflexivity of this kind is ‘reflex like’. It captures the unconscious and unintended consequences of industrial modernization, or what Beck labels the “self-confrontation” aspect of reflexive modernization (see Beck, 1994). (Hendriks and Grin, 2007)
Second-order reflexivity
	•	second-order reflexivity is about the self-critical and self-conscious reflection on processes of modernity, particularly instrumental rationality. It evokes a sense of agency, intention and change. Here actors reflect on and confront not only the self-induced problems of modernity, but also the approaches, structures and systems that reproduce them (Grin et al., 2004; Stirling, 2006). (Hendriks and Grin, 2007)
Reflexive governance
	•	reflexive governance—a mode of steering that encourages actors to scrutinize and reconsider their underlying assumptions, institutional arrangements and practices. (Hendriks and Grin, 2007)
	•	reflexive governance that situates sites of reflexivity within a broader discursive system composed of multiple arenas, actors and forms of political communication. (Hendriks and Grin, 2007)
	•	Reflexive governance of this kind has several significant implications for actors and institutions. First, it demands that they reflect on how their frames, structures and patterns of action contribute to persistent problems (Voß & Kemp, 2005). Actors are also encouraged to loosen their grip on the desire ‘to control’ problems in the way that classical modernity prescribes (Beck et al., 2003; Grin, 2006). Thirdly, reflexive governance requires innovative and strategic thinking to fundamentally transform existing practices and structures (Loorbach & Rotmans, 2006; Schot, 1998). (Hendriks and Grin, 2007)
Reflexive rationality
	•	A growing body of sociological work concludes that means- ends rationality is being displaced by a reflexive rationality. (Rasmussen, 2001)
	•	Reflexive rationality manifests itself in constructivist political practices. (Rasmussen, 2001)
	•	Self-reflexivity is essentially a condition of modernity, as Max Weber tells us. The perpetual questioning of reality by reason is the mark of the modern age. (Coker, 2009)
Reflexive security
	•	A research programme on ‘reflexive security’ is emerging, as a number of students of international security are applying sociological insights of ‘risk society’ to understand new discourses and practices of security. (Rasmussen, 2004)
	•	it offers a way to overcome the debate about whether to apply a ‘broad’ or ‘narrow’ concept of security. (Rasmussen, 2004)
	•	turn to sociologists like Ulrich Beck and Anthony Giddens for heuristic instruments to conceptualise new reflexive practices and discourses of security. (Rasmussen, 2004)
	•	This broader agenda is typical for what Bill McSweeney refers to as the ‘sociological era’ of security studies. (Rasmussen, 2004)
	•	Such ‘reflexive security studies’ use sociological theory heuristically. The work of Ulrich Beck and Anthony Giddens in particular are used to draw the maps of a new landscape of security. (Rasmussen, 2004)
	•	The next stage of ‘reflexive security studies’ ought to translate these empirical findings back into sociological theory. (Rasmussen, 2004)
	•	globalisation and the role of international governance constitute two of the central themes of reflexive security studies. (Rasmussen, 2004)
	•	Reflexivity is not only relevant for a number of new security issues; reflexivity is transforming the security agenda itself. (Rasmussen, 2004)
Regulation
	•	Regulation is embodied in a class of organizational actors called regulators (Power, 2009)
	•	Regulations broadly take three forms: ‘process’ regulations […]; goal-setting regulations […]; standard-setting regulations […].(Great Britain and Health and Safety Executive, 2001)
	•	"Regulation" has become one of the cursewords of our times. (Lowrance, 1980)
Process regulations
	•	‘process’ regulations concerned with what has to be done to manage the control of risks. These include requirements to assess risks, set out management approaches, draw up safety cases, notify hazards, keep records etc. and may include some form of permissioning, eg licensing. Many of the requirements are derived directly from what is implicit in the general duties, eg the need to assess risks. They deal with matters where there is a need to demonstrate that risk is subject to careful, explicit control; (Great Britain and Health and Safety Executive, 2001)
	•	If specific or prescriptive legislation needs to be introduced then process regulations will generally be used as a last resort because they tend to be resource intensive. (Great Britain and Health and Safety Executive, 2001)
	•	Such regulations could require (in ascending order of stringency) the notification of the hazard; the drawing up of safety cases for demonstrating that the risks from the hazard are adequately controlled; or establishing a licensing system that stipulates specific conditions for ensuring health and safety. (Great Britain and Health and Safety Executive, 2001)
Goal-setting regulations
	•	goal-setting regulations which set out the objectives to be achieved but leave considerable freedom on how these objectives are to be met. Goals or targets to be met in such regulations are often qualified by ‘reasonable practicability’ and thus demand from both regulator and duty holders some matching of response to risk and of cost to benefit; (Great Britain and Health and Safety Executive, 2001)
Standard-setting regulations
	•	standard-setting regulations which prescribe what constitutes an appropriate response to a hazard. (Great Britain and Health and Safety Executive, 2001)
Health regulation
	•	Health and safety regulation occupies a disputed borderland verging on the realms of law, politics, and science. Occupational safety and health regulation is all the more controversial, especially when the legal, political, and scientific issues surrounding it are placed within the current context of regulatory reform and economic recession. (Matheny and Williams, 1984)
Safety regulation
	•	Health and safety regulation occupies a disputed borderland verging on the realms of law, politics, and science. Occupational safety and health regulation is all the more controversial, especially when the legal, political, and scientific issues surrounding it are placed within the current context of regulatory reform and economic recession. (Matheny and Williams, 1984)
Regulative idea
	•	regulative ideas' underwrite the systematization and purpose of the form of enquiry that interested him—natural science. They are not derived from nature but are the condition of possibility of our 'interrogation' of nature. (Power, 2009)
	•	regulative ideas in Kant's sense, though fictional, constitute practices and processes of enquiry—not reality itself. They are methodological. (Power, 2009)
Regulatory decision
	•	[…] regulatory decision, which takes account of costs and other nonrisk factors (National Research Council (U.S.) et al., 2009)
	•	regulatory decisions are not necessarily congruent with risk assessment. (National Research Council (U.S.) et al., 2009)
Regulatory regime
	•	regulatory‘regimes’areanalyticconstructs,notdirectlyobservableentities.12 Theycanbe conceived at different levels of breadth or generality and are also potentially n-dimensional, capable in principle of being described at up to infinite levels of complexity. (Hood et al., 2001)
	•	taking a dimensional view of regulatory regimes means characterizing them as more than a single all-encompassing essence. (Hood et al., 2001)
	•	Context and content can be considered as one fundamental dimension of regulatory regimes because, as was noted earlier, much of the debate about how regulation works centres on the relationship between the two. (Hood et al., 2001)
Regime context
	•	Regime context means the backdrop or setting in which regulation takes place, such as the different types and levels of risk being tackled, the nature of public preferences and attitudes over risk, and the way the various actors who produce or are affected by the hazard are organized. (Hood et al., 2001)
	•	regime context denotes the backdrop of regulation, comprising, for example, the intrinsic characteristics of the problem it addresses, public and media attitudes about it, and the way power or influence is concentrated in organized groups. (Hood et al., 2001)
	•	‘Contextualists’ of various kinds see regime content as a product of the policy backdrop. They look for environmental factors—technical, political, or social—to explain what the content of regulatory policy is and why it changes. (Hood et al., 2001)
	•	The context of risk regulation regimes could in principle be characterized in any number of ways. But in the risk regulation literature, three contextual elements tend to be most heavily stressed. As shown in Table 2.2, those basic elements are: type of risk: the inherent nature of the hazard and associated risks (see Royal Society 1992: Chs 1–5); public preferences and attitudes; and organized interests. (Hood et al., 2001)
Type of risk
	•	The first contextual element, type of risk, involves the inherent features of the risk or hazard itself. Those features, much discussed in the literature on risk perception, include its source or cause, how familiar and well-established it is, how easily it can be quantified, its timing or impact, the severity of its consequences, and the probability of occurrence. (Hood et al., 2001)
Public preference attitude
	•	Public preferences and attitudes overlap to some extent with type of risk, since one way of describing risks would be in terms of how they are viewed by the public. (Hood et al., 2001)
	•	risk domains vary widely in terms of the level of overall public concern, varying from high anxiety to deep apathy, and of how ‘hot’ or ‘cold’ they are in media coverage. (Hood et al., 2001)
Organized interests
	•	The nature of organized interests surrounding a risk domain also overlaps with public and media attitudes. But risk domains can vary widely in who creates and who is exposed to the hazard, and in the ways that victims and risk creators are organized. (Hood et al., 2001)
	•	Such distributional questions are often central to risk regulation politics, since they raise issues of relative power and mobilization among the groups affected. (Hood et al., 2001)
Regime content
	•	Regime content means the policy settings, the configuration of state and other organizations directly engaged in regulating the risk, and the attitudes, beliefs, and operating conventions of the regulators. (Hood et al., 2001)
	•	Regime content denotes regulatory objectives, the way regulatory responsibilities are organized, and operating styles of regulators. (Hood et al., 2001)
	•	At the most general level, much discussion of regime content relates to three overlapping elements that also appear in Table 2.2. These three basic elements are: size; structure; and style. (Hood et al., 2001)
	•	As with any tool, how we use the idea of regime anatomy as a method of comparing types of regulation depends on what we are applying it to and what we are using it for. The more similar the systems being compared, the further down the scale of disaggregation the comparison will need to go if their distinctive fingerprints are to be identified. (Hood et al., 2001)
	•	How far we need to disaggregate regimes to greater levels of complexity also depends on how many ‘degrees of freedom’ there are in regulatory regimes—that is, how far variation in one element of a regime is linked to variation in another, or how far we can predict what one dimension of a regulatory regime will be like from knowledge about another dimension. If there are infinite degrees of freedom in regulatory regimes, we need very complex ways of describing and comparing them; if there are only a few degrees of freedom, a parsimonious characterization will suffice. (Hood et al., 2001)
Regime size
	•	Regime size means broadly how much regulation is brought to bear on any risk through the given regime. (Hood et al., 2001)
	•	Size can be conceived in at least two separate ways. One is what we shall later term ‘aggression’, denoting the extent of risk toleration in standards and behaviour- modification, and how far regulators go in collecting information about the risk. Another is the overall scale of investment that goes into the regime from all sources, in the form of direct tax-financed state spending, state employment, or compliance costs imposed on business firms or non-state actors. (Hood et al., 2001)
	•	Regulatory size is what is broadly at issue for those who are concerned about the balance between the state and the market, the threshold of risk toleration in regulation, the degree of ‘anticipationism’ in risk regulation, or the extent of regulatory bureaucracy. (Hood et al., 2001)
	•	risk regulation regimes vary markedly on several dimensions of size. (Hood et al., 2001)
Structure
	•	Structure overlaps with size to some extent. It refers to the way regulation is organized, what institutional arrangements are adopted, and the way resources invested in regulation are distributed. (Hood et al., 2001)
	•	Like size, structure can be conceived in at least two ways. One is the extent to which regulation involves a mix of public and private sector actors—for instance, with non-state organizations operating as intermediaries, auxiliaries, or self-controllers—particularly in the distribution of compliance costs between regulators and regulatees. Another is how densely populated the regulatory space or policy community is by separate institutions, and how far the risk involves multiple overlapping systems of regulation. (Hood et al., 2001)
	•	Regulatory structure is much debated by policy and public administration specialists, going beyond issues of state versus market or how aggressively regulation should be pursued. (Hood et al., 2001)
	•	Structure is what is broadly at issue for those who are concerned about the balance between direct and indirect enforcement of regulation, the distribution of compliance costs, and ‘joining up’ regulatory activity across different organizations, systems, or levels of government. (Hood et al., 2001)
	•	Redundancy—the existence of multiple overlapping systems of control—is also much debated, for instance as between the difficulties it can present for clear-cut lines of accountability and the advantages it can present for reinforcement and robustness (see Sagan 1993). (Hood et al., 2001)
	•	risk regulation varies markedly from one domain to another in structure. (Hood et al., 2001)
Style
	•	This element denotes the operating conventions and attitudes of those involved in regulation, and the formal and informal processes through which regulation works. (Hood et al., 2001)
	•	Like size and structure, style can be conceived in at least two ways. One, familiar in socio-legal discussions, is the question of how far the operation of regulation is rule-bound or discretionary, and how far it is based on direct ‘command and control’ approaches rather than other policy instruments. Another is the attitudes and beliefs of the various regulatory actors and in particular the degree of zeal they show in pursuit of policy objectives. (Hood et al., 2001)
	•	we can observe substantial variety across different risk domains. (Hood et al., 2001)
	•	Some risks, for instance, are regulated by ‘zealots’ (Downs 1967) with a lifetime commitment to, and passion for, a particular approach to policy, while for others regulators only go through the motions and are sunk in apathy or fatalism. (Hood et al., 2001)
	•	Some risks are handled by bureaucratic generalists, operating as fixers whose main concern is to cut deals that satisfy different stakeholders, while others are owned by a distinctive professional community. (Hood et al., 2001)
	•	some risks are regulated by strict ‘rule and rote’, as in the case of air safety, space travel, and weapons safety; for others there is a gap between the formal rules and what happens in practice, as in the case of police enforcement of speeding rules; and for yet others rules are much vaguer and less dense. (Hood et al., 2001)
	•	Some risks are regulated within a professional community that crosses the boundaries between regulators and regulatees, while others involve more distance, or even outright conflict, between the regulators and the regulated. (Hood et al., 2001)
	•	for the purposes of describing a wide range of contemporary debates about regulatory design and operation we do not need to go below the first or second level of disaggregation of regime context and content. (Hood et al., 2001)
Regulatory science
	•	The very idea of 'regulatory science', as paradoxical as it may sound, simply reflects the necessity for science-based risk analysts, or any risk expert, to adopt strategies to embed their risk objects in regulatory regimes. (Power, 2009)
	•	As well as a ‘risk society’, we are also said to live in a ‘regulatory society’ (Majone 1994). The idea of the ‘regulatory state’ is that a new institutional and policy style has emerged, in which government’s role as regulator advances while its role as a direct employer or property-owner may decline through privatization and bureaucratic downsizing. (Hood et al., 2001)
	•	The two ideas of ‘risk society’ and ‘regulatory state’ could, indeed, be linked in so ar as risk and safety is often held to be one of the major drivers of contemporary regulatory growth. (Hood et al., 2001)
Regulatory state
	•	'regulatory' state suggest that risk management is shaping conceptions of government itself. (Power, 2009)
Regression
	•	The logic of multiple regression is unassailable: it finds the optimal formula for putting together a weighted combination of the predictors. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	regression models allow us to control for the impact of other factors while we study and analyze the impact of a particular factor. (Haider, 2016)
	•	The all else being equal property of the regression models allows us to isolate the effect of one particular influence by controlling the impact of others. (Haider, 2016)
Regression models
	•	In almost all empirical pursuits of research, either in the academic or professional fields, the use of regression models, or their variants, is ubiquitous. In medical science, regression models are being used to develop more effective medicines, improve the methods for operations, and optimize resources for small and large hospitals. In the business world, regression models are at the forefront of analyzing consumer behavior, firm productivity, and competitiveness of public- and private-sector entities. (Haider, 2016)
	•	Regression models are therefore the right tool to conduct analysis with multiple variables. Such models allow one to control for a variety of factors on the variable or behavior of interest. (Haider, 2016)
Regret
	•	Regret is an emotion, and it is also a punishment that we administer to ourselves. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	The emotional state has been well described by two Dutch psychologists, who noted that regret is “accompanied by feelings that one should have known better, by a B thinking feeling, by thoughts about the mistake one has made and the opportunities lost, by a tendency to kick oneself and to correct one’s mistake, and by wanting to undo the event and to get a second chance.” (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	Regret is one of the counterfactual emotions that are triggered by the availability of alternatives to reality. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	Regret and blame are both evoked by a comparison to a norm (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	The asymmetry in the risk of regret favors conventional and risk-averse choices (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	Daniel Gilbert and his colleagues provocatively claim that people generally anticipate more regret than they will actually experience, because they underestimate the efficacy of the psychological defenses they will deploy—which they label the “psychological immune system.” (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	
Regret theory
	•	The problem is that regret theories make few striking predictions that would distinguish them from prospect theory, which has the advantage of being simpler. (Kahneman, 2012)
Fear of regret
	•	the fear of regret is a factor in many of the decisions that people make (“Don’t do this, you will regret it” is a common warning), and the actual experience of regret is familiar. (Kahneman, 2012)
Intense regret
	•	Intense regret is what you experience when you can most easily imagine yourself doing something other than what you did. (Kahneman, 2012)
Decision regret
	•	‘Decision regret’ leads to post hoc unease about losses experienced or gains not realised. (Roberts, 2001a)
Regulatory agency
	•	Regulatory agencies have used the risk assessment process for nearly 50 years, most notably the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (USFDA). (Paustenbach, 2002a)
	•	Regulatory agencies are staffed by professional civil servants who are not subject to removal with every change in government. At the same time they are steeped in the history and tradition of bureaucratic decision making …" (Brickman, Jasanoff, and Ilgen 1985, 305). (Lofstedt, 2004)
Religion
	•	la religion, "chose éminemment sociale »31, est, en effet, orientée principalement vers l’élaboration des liens étroits entre les hommes. Le latin (re-)ligare est sans ambiguïté sur ce point. La généralité et l’ancienneté du phénomène que l’on retrouve chez tous les peuples, au-delà des aspects qu’il peut revêtir, attestent suffisamment, semble-t-il, de sa nécessité. Les individus savent, bien que confusément, qu’ils ne peuvent vivre isolés les uns des autres et que leur association, voire leur « fusion » (c’est le sens latin de communion) en une unité transcendant les individualités est indispensable : l’Eglise ou la Diaspora32. Et ils sont prêts à payer le prix de cette sécurité indispensable par la soumission aux impératifs, au dogmatisme et aux restrictions que leur impose alors la religion (ou le groupe social). (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	L'intolérance et le fanatisme constituent l'accompagnement nécessaire d'un sentiment religieux. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Tous les fondateurs de croyances religieuses ou politiques ne les ont fondées que parce qu'ils ont su imposer aux foules ces sentiments de fanatisme qui font que l'homme trouve son bonheur dans l'adoration et l'obéissance et est prêt à donner sa vie pour son idole. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	il faut une religion aux foules, puisque toutes les croyances politiques, divines et sociales ne s'établissent chez elles qu'à la condition de revêtir toujours la forme religieuse, qui les met à l'abri de la discussion. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	L'objet de ses croyances religieuses s'était transformé, mais ses sentiments religieux, peut-on dire vraiment qu'ils avaient changé? (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Il y a des phénomènes sociaux qu'il faut étudier en psychologue beaucoup plus qu'en naturaliste. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	si la religion nouvelle exerce d'abord, comme toutes celles qui l'ont précédée, un rôle destructeur, elle ne saurait exercer ensuite, comme elles, un rôle créateur. (Lebon, 1895)
Religious
	•	we tend to believe that someone who adheres to a particular religion or political belief system or moral code must have the character to go with this. But people bring the character they have to the position they occupy or to the religion they practice. A person can be a progressive liberal or a loving Christian and still be an intolerant tyrant at heart. (Greene, 2018)
	•	On n'est pas religieux seulement quand on adore une divinité, mais quand on met toutes les ressources de l'esprit, toutes les soumissions de la volonté, toutes les ardeurs du fanatisme au service d'une cause ou d'un être qui devient le but et le guide des pensées et des actions. (Lebon, 1895)
Religious illusion
	•	 The spectacle is the material reconstruction of the religious illusion. (Debord, 2012)
Rennaissance
	•	a cultural movement for which the ideal was the Universal Man – a person who has managed to connect all branches of knowledge and approximate the intellectual reach of the Creator. (Greene, 2014)
	•	In the Rennaissance, the ideal was to become the Univrsal Man – a person so steeped in all forms of knowledge that his mind frows closer to the reality of nature itself and sees secrets that are invisible to most people. (Greene, 2014)
Representations of practice 
	•	Ideal designs and representations of practice are quick to diffuse and travel in varying degrees of rationalization and codification within laws and popular management texts (Power, 2009)
Repulsion
	•	On either end of the spectrum—attraction or repulsion—you will tend to be irrational and you will desperately need to distance yourself. A good strategy to utilize is to see through the front they project. They inevitably try to cast a larger-than-life image, a mythic, intimidating quality; but in fact they are all too human, full of the same insecurities and weaknesses we all possess. Try to recognize these very human traits and demythologize them. (Greene, 2018)
Reputation
	•	when we look at people we often are really seeing only their reputation, the myth that surrounds them, the position they occupy, and not the individual. (Greene, 2018)
Requisite variety
	•	"requisite variety," because the variety that exists in the system to be managed exceeds the variety in the people who must regulate it. (Weick, 1987)
Research design
	•	[…] research design – that is to say, all those operational decisions concerning where, how and when to gather the data; this means deciding what data-collection tools are to be used (interview or participant observation, questionnaire or experiment, etc.), where data collection is to be carried out, how many and which subjects or organizations are to be studies, etc. (Corbetta, 2003)

Quantitative design
	•	The quantitative design, which is drawn up on a paper before data collection begins, is rigidly structured and closed (Corbetta, 2003)

Qualitative design
	•	[…] the qualitative design is unstructured, open, shaped during the course of data collection and able to capture the unforeseen. (Corbetta, 2003)

Respect
	•	People are generally indifferent to your fate, not as antagonistic as you imagine. Very few of their actions are really directed at you. Stop seeing everything in personal terms. Respect is something that must be earned through your achievements, not something given to you simply for being human. You must break out of the resentful cycle by becoming more generous toward people and human nature. (Greene, 2018)
Restlessness
	•	Our path must always be toward greater awareness of our nature. We must see within ourselves the grass-is-always-greener syndrome at work and how it continually impels us to certain actions. We need to be able to distinguish between what is positive and productive in our covetous tendencies and what is negative and counterproductive. On the positive side, feeling restless and discontented can motivate us to search for something better and to not settle for what we have. It enlarges our imagination as we consider other possibilities instead of the circumstances we face. As we get older, we tend to become more complacent, and renewing the restlessness of our earlier years can keep us youthful and our minds active.This restlessness, however, must be under conscious control. Often our discontent is merely chronic; our desire for change is vague and a reflection of our boredom. This leads to a waste of precious time. We are unhappy with the way our career is going and so we make a big change, which requires learning new skills and acquiring new contacts. We enjoy the newness of it all. But several years later we again feel the stirring of discontent. This new path isn’t right either. We would have been better off thinking about this more deeply, homing in on those aspects of our previous career that did not click and trying for a more gentle change, choosing a line of work related to the previous one but requiring an adaptation of our skills. (Greene, 2018)

Resilience
	•	“resilience” (efforts to cope with dangers once they become manifest). (Sagan, 1995)
	•	Resilience is the “adaptive capacity of an organization in a complex and changing environment” (International Organization for Standardization, 2009a, p. 11). (Newsome, 2013)
	•	The U.S. DHS (2009) defined resilience as “the ability to resist, absorb, recover from, or successfully adapt to adversity or a change in conditions” (p. 111). (Newsome, 2013)
	•	In Britain, “resilience reflects how flexibly this capacity can be deployed in response to new or increased risks or opportunities” (U.K. Prime Minister’s Strategy Unit, 2005, p. 38), the “ability of the community, services, area, or infrastructure to detect, prevent, and, if necessary, to withstand, handled and recover from disruptive challenges” (U.K. Cabinet Office, 2013), or is the “ability of an organization to resist being affected by an incident” (U.K. MOD, 2011c, p. Glossary-3). (Newsome, 2013)
	•	In Canada, resilience is “the capacity of a system, community, or society to adapt to disruptions resulting from hazards by persevering, recuperating, or changing to reach and maintain an acceptable level of functioning” (Public Safety Canada, 2012, p. 80). (Newsome, 2013)
Community resilience
	•	Community resilience is “communities and individuals harnessing local resources and expertise to helpthemselves in an emergency, in a way that complements the response of theemergency services” (U.K. Cabinet Office, 2013). (Newsome, 2013)
Resistance
Resistance Practice
	•	To attain mastery, you must adopt what we shall call Resistance Practice. The principle is simple—you go in the opposite direction of all of your natural tendencies when it comes to practice. First, you resist the temptation to be nice to yourself. You become your own worst critic; you see your work as if through the eyes of others. You recognize your weaknesses, precisely the elements you are not good at. Those are the aspects you give precedence to in your practice. You find a kind of perverse pleasure in moving past the pain this might bring. Second, you resist the lure of easing up on your focus. You train yourself to concentrate in practice with double the intensity, as if it were the real thing times two. In devising your own routines, you become as creative as possible. You invent exercises that work upon your weaknesses. You give yourself arbitrary deadlines to meet certain standards, constantly pushing yourself past perceived limits. In this way you develop your own standards for excellence, generally higher than those of others. In the end, your five hours of intense, focused work are the equivalent of ten for most people. Soon enough you will see the results of such practice, and others will marvel at the apparent ease in which you accomplish your deeds. (Greene, 2014)
Restrictive law
	•	Le second des dangers mentionnés plus haut, la restriction forcée des libertés par les assemblées parlementaires, moins visible en apparence est cependant fort réel. Il est la conséquence des innombrables lois—toujours restrictives—dont les parlements, avec leur esprit simpliste, voient mal les conséquences, et qu'ils se croient obligés de voter. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	indépendant de son électeur, n'a pas réussi à s'y soustraire. Herbert Spencer, dans un travail déjà ancien, avait montré que l'accroissement de la liberté apparente devait être suivi d'une diminution de la liberté réelle. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Cette restriction progressive des libertés se manifeste pour tous les pays sous une forme spéciale, que Herbert Spencer n'a pas indiquée, et qui est celle-ci: La création de ces séries innombrables de mesures législatives, toutes généralement d'ordre restrictif, conduit nécessairement à augmenter le nombre, le pouvoir et l'influence des fonctionnaires chargés de les appliquer. Ils tendent ainsi progressivement à devenir les véritables maîtres des pays civilisés. Leur puissance est d'autant plus grande, que, dans les incessants changements de pouvoir, la caste administrative est la seule qui échappe à ces changements, la seule qui possède l'irresponsabilité, l'impersonnalité et la perpétuité. Or, de tous les despotismes, il n'en est pas de plus lourds que ceux qui se présentent sous cette triple forme. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Cette création incessante de lois et de règlements restrictifs entourant des formalités les plus byzantines les moindres actes de la vie, a pour résultat fatal de rétrécir de plus en plus la sphère dans laquelle les citoyens peuvent se mouvoir librement. Victimes de cette illusion qu'en multipliant les lois l'égalité et la liberté se trouvent mieux assurées, les peuples acceptent chaque jour de plus pesantes entraves. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Avec l'indifférence et l'impuissance croissantes des citoyens, le rôle des gouvernements est obligé de grandir encore. Ce sont eux qui doivent avoir forcément l'esprit d'initiative, d'entreprise et de conduite que les particuliers n'ont plus. Il leur faut tout entreprendre, tout diriger, tout protéger. L'État devient un dieu tout-puissant. Mais l'expérience enseigne que le pouvoir de tels dieux ne fut jamais ni bien durable, ni bien fort. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Cette restriction progressive de toutes les libertés chez certains peuples, malgré une licence extérieure qui leur donne l'illusion de les posséder, semble être une conséquence de leur vieillesse tout autant que celle d'un régime quelconque. Elle constitue un des symptômes précurseurs de cette phase de décadence à laquelle aucune civilisation n'a pu échapper jusqu'ici. (Lebon, 1895)
Retrievability
	•	Retrievability is influenced by the number of locations in which information is stored and the number and strength of pathways from this information to other concepts that might be activated by incomng information. The more frequently a path is followed, the stronger that path becomes and the more readily available the information located along that path. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	After thinking our way back into the appropriate context and finding the general location in our memory, the interconnections become more readily available. We begin to remember names, places, and events that had seemed to be forgotten. (Heuer, 1999)
Revealed preference approach
	•	To the extent that principles of liability frequently take account of whether consent was ob- tained from an injured party, it is worth noting that loss spreading would be consistent with a revealed preference approach to obtaining consent sometimes called implicit consent. This allows market forces to determine planning priorities, the rationale being that people’s preferences for one solution or another will be accurately reflected in how they spend their money. (Rayner and Cantor, 1987)
Reward
Small reward
	•	when giving people gifts or rewards as a possible means of winning them over to your side, it is always best to give smaller gifts or rewards than larger ones. Large gifts make it too apparent that you are trying to buy their loyalty, which will offend people’s sense of independence. Some might accept large gifts out of need, but later they will feel resentful or suspicious. Smaller gifts have a better effect— people can tell themselves they deserve such things and are not being bought or bribed. In fact, such smaller rewards, spread out over time, will bind people to you in a much greater way than anything lavish. (Greene, 2018)
	•	
Review
	•	review as an “activity undertaken to determinethe suitability, adequacy and effectiveness of the subject matter to achieve established objectives”. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Review procedures should explicitly question the mental model employed by the analyst in searching for and examining evidence. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Ideally, the review process should include analysts from other areas who are not specialists in the subject matter of the report. Analysts within the same branch or division often share a similar mind-set. (Heuer, 1999)
Pre-publication review 
	•	Pre-publication review of analytical reports offers another opportu- nity to bring alternative perspectives to bear on an issue. (Heuer, 1999) 
Rhetoric of rights
	•	Rhetoric of rights may be simply a way to elevate instrumental behaviour to the level of a moral imperative in order to limit negotiation. (Nelkin, 1992)
Reporting
Subordinate reporting
	•	subordinate reporting as a “form of communication intended to inform particular internal or external stakeholders by providing information regarding the current state of risk and its management.” (Newsome, 2013)
Representativeness
	•	Representativeness denotes the process of judging the probability that an individual fits into a particular category by examining the degree to which the individual displays a few salient features of category members but ignoring base rates for the categories. (Weinstein, 1980)
Repetition
Continuous repetition
	•	Continuous repetition does not necessarily guarantee that something will be remembered. (Heuer, 1999)
Report
Brief report
	•	A brief report is more to the point and presents a summary of key findings. (Haider, 2016)
	•	Brief reports were drafted as commentaries on current trends and developments that attracted public or media attention. (Haider, 2016)
Detailed report
	•	A detailed report incrementally builds the argument and contains details about other relevant works, research methodology, data sources, and intermediate findings along with the main results. (Haider, 2016)
	•	Detailed and comprehensive reports offered a critical review of the subject matter with extensive data analysis and commentary. Often, detailed reports collected new data or interviewed industry experts to answer the research questions. (Haider, 2016)
Report validity
	•	Knowing the circumstances in which reporting was obtained is often critical to understanding its validity. (US Government, 2009)
	•	(Haider, 2016)
Repression
	•	des procédures plus radicales de contrôle se mettent en place. (Mannoni, 1985)
Reputation
	•	Reputation has come to be an object of governing significance for organizations as they operate in densely populated and active institutional environments. (Power, 2009)
	•	Reputation and blame have emerged as distinctive kinds of meta-risk objects for all organizations. (Power, 2009)
	•	Reputations may be a critical asset and take a considerable time to develop and replace after negative publicity. (Vellani, 2007)
Reversed psychology
	•	Keep in mind the following: people often won’t do what others ask them to do, because they simply want to assert their will. If you heartily agree with their rebellion and tell them to keep on doing what they’re doing, it now means that if they do so they are following your advice, which is distasteful to them. They may very well rebel again and assert their will in the opposite direction, which is what you wanted all along—the essence of reverse psychology. (Greene, 2018)
Revolution
	•	revolutions fail as often as they succeed. (Betts, 2007)
	•	predicting revolutions is very hard. They are not well understood by social science and almost by definition must come as a surprise to many informed observers, especially those in authority. If the latter understood what was coming, they would flee, use force, or make concessions. (Jervis, 2010)
	•	revolutions arise not from a simple aggregation of desires and action but from a complex interaction among large number of individuals, groups, and centers of power. (Jervis, 2010)
	•	On a political level, our government is corrupt and we need some real change, perhaps a revolution. In this revolution, we imagine a veritable utopia that replaces the imperfect world we live in. We don’t think of the vast majority of revolutions in history in which the results were more of the same, or something worse. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Les instincts révolutionnaires momentanés des foules ne les empêchent pas d'être extrêmement conservatrices.—Elles sont d'instinct hostiles aux changements et au progrès. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Les révolutions n'ont même ce pouvoir que lorsque la croyance a perdu presque entièrement son empire sur les âmes. Les révolutions servent alors à balayer finalement ce qui était à peu près abandonné déjà, mais ce que le joug de la coutume empêchait d'abandonner entièrement. Les révolutions qui commencent sont en réalité des croyances qui finissent. (Lebon, 1895) 
	•	L'histoire de la Révolution montre à quel point les assemblées peuvent devenir inconscientes et obéir aux suggestions les plus contraires à leurs intérêts. (Lebon, 1895)
History of revolution
	•	History generally, and the history of revolutions in particular, is always richer in content, more varied, more manysided, more lively and 'subtle' than even" the best historian and the best methodologist can imagine. (Feyerabend, 1993)
Cultural revolution
	•	In essence, the Cultural Revolution was Mao’s attempt to try to alter human nature itself. According to Mao, through millennia of capitalism in various forms, humans had become individualistic and conservative, bound to their social class. Mao wanted to wipe the slateclean and start over. As he explained it, “A clean sheet of paper has no blotches, and so the newest and most beautiful pictures can be painted on it.” To get his blank canvas, Mao would have to shake things up on a mass scale by uprooting old habits and ways of thinking and by eradicating people’s mindless respect for those in authority. Once he accomplished this, Mao could start to paint something bold and new on the clean sheet. The result would be a fresh generation that could begin to forge a classless society not weighed down by the past. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Mao had the following specific strategy to enact his bold idea: Focus people’s attention on a legitimate enemy—in this case, revisionists, those who consciously or unconsciously were clinging to the past. Encourage people, particularly the young, to actively fight against this reactionary force, but also against any entrenched forms of authority. In struggling against these conservative enemies, the Chinese would be able to free themselves from old patterns of thinking and acting; they would finally get rid of elites and ranking systems; and they would unify as a revolutionary class with utmost clarity as to what they were fighting for. (Greene, 2018)
Proletarian revolution
	•	the bourgeois revolution is over; the proletarian revolution is a project born on the foundation of the preceding revolution but differing from it qualitatively. (Debord, 2012)
	•	Proletarian revolution depends entirely on the condition that, for the first time, theory as intelligence of human practice be recognized and lived by the masses. It requires workers to become d ialecticians and to inscribe their thought into practice. Thus it demands more of men without quality than the bourgeois revolution demanded of the qualified men which it delegated to its task (the partial ideological con­ sciousness built by a part of the bourgeois class had the economy at its basis, this central part of social life in which this class was already in power) . The very development of class society to the point of the spec­ tacular organization of non-life thus leads the revolutionary project to become visibly what it already was essentially. (Debord, 2012)
	•	Revolutionary theory is now the enemy of all revolutionary ideologyand knows it. (Debord, 2012)
Revolutionnary organization
	•	A revolutionary organization existing before the power of the Coun­ cils (it will find its own form through struggle), for all these historical reasons, already knows that it does not represent the working class. It must only recognize itself as a radical separation with the world of separation. (Debord, 2012)
	•	The revolutionary organization is the coherent expression of the theory of praxis entering into non-unilateral communication with prac­ tical struggles, in the process of becoming practical theory. Its own practice is the generalization of communication and of coherence in these struggles. At the revolutionary moment of dissolution of social separation, this organization must recognize its own dissolution as a separate organization. (Debord, 2012)
	•	The revolutionary organization can be nothing less than a unitary critique of society, namely a critique which does not compromise with any form of separate power anywhere in the world, and a critique proclaimed globally against all the aspects of alienated social life. (Debord, 2012)
	•	In the struggle of the revolutionary organization against the class society, weapons are nothing other than the essence of the combatants them­ selves: the revolutionary organization cannot reproduce within itself the conditions of separation and hierarchy of the dominant society. It must struggle constantly against its deformation in the ruling spectacle. (Debord, 2012)
Rich-get-richer mechanism
	•	The more connections a node has at a certain moment, the more it is capable of attracting new connections. This is why the preferential attachment is also called the rich-get-richer mechanism. As a consequence, the initially small differences in connectivity are progressively amplified. Thus, a hierarchy of different nodes emerges, with a large variety in their degrees, ranging from the least connected ones to those that have accumulated many links, i.e. the hubs. The resulting network is heterogeneous, with a power-law degree distribution. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
Right claims
	•	Thus, rights claims may be the central issue in a dispute, or simply a tactic, a way to gain public support in a controversial political context (Nelkin, 1992)
Risk
	•	Risk is unequivocally used to mean danger from future damage, caused by the opponents (Douglas, 2005:30)
	•	[...] risk is not only the probability of an event but also the probable magnitude of its outcome, and everything depends on the value that is set on the outcome (Douglas, 2005:31)
	•	‘risk’ does not signify an all-round assessment of probable outcomes but becomes a stick for beating authority, often a slogan for mustering xenophobia (Douglas, 2005:39)
	•	‘Risk’ is the probability of an event combined with the magnitude of the losses and gains that it will entail (Douglas, 2005:40)
	•	Risks, as Beck uses the term, are uncontrollable scientific, technical or social developments which were started long before their side-effects or long-term consequences were known (Douglas, 2005:45)
	•	Risk now mean danger, high risk means a lot of danger (Douglas, 2005:24)
	•	risk is an independent variable on which the character of accountability depends, accountability demands may be an independent variable on which the growth and application of risk ideas depend (Rothstein and alt., 2013:218)
	•	risk provides, at least in principle, a lingua franca for developing common understandings and approaches across regimes (Rothstein and alt., 2013:228)
	•	Risk can be thought of as the likelihood of a certain event taking place (Sottilotta, 2016)
	•	Risk may be amplified by the media, potentially distorting priorities (Kaspersen et al 1988) (Roberts, 2001a) 
	•	Risk always have to break through in order to be acknowledged, is overcome and the destruction of the forest is understood and recognized as an effect of industrialization. Only then does it become a long-term, systematically caused problem, which can no longer be alleviated at the local level, but instead requires political solution (Beck, 1992)
	•	Risks of course do not exhaust themselves in the effects and damages that have already occurred (Beck, 1992)
	•	Risks essentially express a future component. This is based in part on the prolonging of currently calculable damages into the future, and in part on a general loss of confidence or on ‘risk multipliers (Beck, 1992)
	•	Risk have something to do with anticipation, with destruction that has not yet happened but is threatening, and of course in that sense risks are already real today (Beck, 1992)
	•	Risks have something unreal about them (Beck, 1992)
	•	Risks lies in the projected dangers of the future. In this sense there are hazard which, if they occur, would mean destruction on such a scale that action afterwards would be practically impossible (Beck, 1992)
	•	The center of risk consciousness lies not in the present, but in the future (Beck, 1992)
	•	[…] risk have successfully passed through a process of social recognition (Beck, 1992)
	•	Risks can be legitimated by the fact that one neither saw nor wanted their consequences. (Beck, 1992)
	•	Risk positions first have to break through the protective shield of taboos surround them, and ‘be born scientifically’ in scientific civilization (Beck, 1992)
	•	Risk display an equalizing effect within their scope and among those affected by them (Beck, 1992)
	•	Risks display a social boomerang effect in their diffusion: even the rich and powerful are not safe from them (Beck, 1992)
	•	Risks like wealth are the object of distribution, and both constitute positions – risk positions and class positions respectively (Beck, 1992)
	•	Risk are incidental problem of modernization in undesirable abundance (Beck, 1992)
	•	Risk experienced presume a normative horizon of lost security and broken trust (Beck, 1992)
	•	In traditions focused on health and safety, risk is equated with possible hazards and dangers (Power, 2009)
	•	finance it is a technical matter of volatility in expected outcomes, both negative and positive. (Power, 2009)
	•	In other business and political settings, risk is closely associated with the spirit of enterprise and the creation of value (Power, 2009)
	•	risk in its raw form has acquired social, political and organizational significance as never before, and this needs explanation even if, as seems likely, risk itself is an essentially contested concept. If we accept this fact, then the question of defining risk is not as important as analysing the nature of the social and economic institutions which shape and frame our knowledge of, and management strategies for, risk, including the definition of specific 'risk objects'. (Power, 2009)
	•	This also seems to be the meaning of Ewald's (1991: 199) much cited claim that, 'Nothing is a risk in itself; there is no risk in reality. But on the other hand anything can be a risk; it all depends on how one analyses the danger, considers the event. (Power, 2009)
	•	When objects of concern are described in terms of risk, they are placed in a web of expectations about management and act or responsibility. (Power, 2009)
	•	So when the UK Royal Society report in 1992defined risk as 'the chance, in quantitative terms, of a defined hazard occurring' […] (Power, 2009)
	•	risk as a hazard or undesirable outcome to a principle of social organization. (Power, 2009)
	•	risk is not only to be governed in a management process for the sake of enhancing the capacity to avoid or mitigate harms. It is also to be done in the name of opportunity and enterprise as notions of enterprise risk management (Power, 2009)
	•	Risk enters into the description of the everyday in a manner coextensive with personal responsibility and innovation (Power, 2009)
	•	The focus of risk debate will shift from the passive prevention of harm to a more active search for safety (Sagan, 1995)
	•	risk provides an organising concept for societal decision-making under uncertainty and is a key characteristic of modernity (Rothstein et al., 2006)
	•	risk is the necessary accompaniment of the transformation of a society of pawns, directed at the whim of the gods, into a society of actors managing their own destiny (Rothstein et al., 2006)
	•	The idea of risk could have been custom-made (Douglas, 2005)
	•	The word risk has acquired new prominence (Douglas, 2005)
	•	risk is a word that admirably serves the forensic needs of the new global culture (Douglas, 2005)
	•	Risk would have become the idiom of politics as part of the homogenizing process of moving to a new world level of interaction (Douglas, 2005)
	•	the risk that is a central concept for our policy debates has not got much to do with probability calculations (Douglas, 2005)
	•	concept of risk emerges as a key idea for modern times because of its uses as a forensic resource (Douglas, 2005)
	•	Risk is invoked for a modern-style riposte against abuse of power (Douglas, 2005)
	•	risk provides secular terms for rewriting scripture: not the sins of the fathers, but the risks unleashed by the fathers are visited on the heads of their children, even to the nth generation (Douglas, 2005)
	•	risk seems to look forward: it is used to assess the dangers ahead (Douglas, 2005)
	•	Risk concerns may provide a rationale for actions taken on other grounds or they may be a surrogate for other social or ideological concerns (Slovic, 1987)
	•	It is interesting to note here the etymology of the English word "risk". According to the Unabridged Random House Dictionary, the word risk comes to us through the French, Italian, and Latin, originating from the Greek word rhiza, in reference to the hazards of sailing around a cliff. (Covello and Mumpower, 1986)
	•	Slovic has challenged the foundation of their expertise: the idea that risk is objective: “Risk” does not exist “out there,” independent of our minds and culture, waiting to be measured. Human beings have invented the concept of “risk” to help them understand and cope with the dangers and uncertainties of life. Although these dangers are real, there is no such thing as “real risk” or “objective risk.” (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	risk is when there is "accurate knowledge of a probability distribution of the consequences that will follow on each alternative" (Clarke, 1999)
	•	risk is when you know the possible range of things that may happen following a choice; uncertainty is when you don't.
 (Clarke, 1999)
	•	risk and uncertainty were "categorically different," (Clarke, 1999)
	•	Risk in its general form is when it is possible, at least in principle, to estimate the likelihood that an event (or set of events) will occur; the specific forms of those estimates are the probabilities of adverse consequences  (Clarke, 1999)
	•	risk is conventionally understood as "exposure to the chance of loss," (Leiss, 1996)
	•	The technical concept of risk focuses narrowly on the probability of events and the magnitude of specific consequences. (Kasperson et al., 1988)
	•	Risk is usually defined by multiplication of the two terms, assuming that society should be indifferent toward a low-consequence/high-probability risk and a high-consequence/low-probability risk with identical expected values. (Kasperson et al., 1988)
	•	Risk is a bellwether in social decisions about technologies. (Kasperson et al., 1988)
	•	the technical concept of risk is too narrow and ambiguous to serve as the crucial yardstick for policy making. (Kasperson et al., 1988)
	•	This is generally defined as: Risk =  (Rayner and Cantor, 1987)
	•	the essence of risk consists of the probability of an adverse event and the magnitude of its consequences. (Rayner and Cantor, 1987)
	•	Common-sense definitions of risk frequently do not depend on probabilities of loss. They may rest exclusively on magnitude. (Rayner and Cantor, 1987)
	•	Rayner has argued that risk may be a polythetic concept, which is composed of a chain of items sharing features with their neighbors on either side, but lacking any single essential feature. In these systems of concept formation, items at one end of the chain need not have any conditions in common with those at the other end. (Rayner and Cantor, 1987)
	•	Economic rationalists argue that individuals decide to take a risk weighng its potential costs and benefits and then opting for the course of action that they think will maximize the advantages that will accrue. (Rayner and Cantor, 1987)
	•	Risk is rather a way of classifying a whole series of complex interactions and relationships between people, as well as between man and nature. (Rayner and Cantor, 1987)
	•	Rayner and Cantor conclude that 'risk', even when considered abstractly, is a 'polythetic' concept, composed of a chain of items sharing features with their neighbours on either side, but lacking any single essential feature. In these systems of concept formation, items at one end of the chain need not have any conditions in common with those at the other end (Rayner & Cantor 1987:3-4). (Boholm, 1996)
	•	Risk is the chance that something adverse will happen. To take a risk is deliberately to incur that chance; and estimating a risk involves defining that something precisely and finding a way of calculating how often it is likely to happen in particular circumstances. (Great Britain and Health and Safety Executive, 1992)
	•	'Risk' is the chance and the consequences taken together. In common speech we quite often use the word 'risk' as referring more to the consequence than to the probability. (Great Britain and Health and Safety Executive, 1992)
	•	Whenever we do something that involves taking a risk - even stepping off a pavement when there is traffic - we usually do so because we believe we can see some benefit that outweighs it. We are likely to take the consequence for granted, to estimate the risk, however instinctively, and then see if we can reduce or avoid it. (Great Britain and Health and Safety Executive, 1992)
	•	this means 'the probability that a specified undesirable event will occur in a specified period or as the result of a specified situation'. In this usage, both the probability and the event, and perhaps also its severity, have to be specified. Thus risk can never be reduced to a single quantity; it must always contain at least two separate components. (Great Britain and Health and Safety Executive, 1992)
	•	Hazard and risk are used interchangeably in everyday vocabulary. Nevertheless, it has proved useful to HSE to make a conceptual distinction between a ‘hazard’ and a ‘risk’. (Great Britain and Health and Safety Executive, 2001)
	•	risk as the chance that someone or something that is valued will be adversely affected in a stipulated way by the hazard. (Great Britain and Health and Safety Executive, 2001)
	•	The concepts of hazard and risk are enshrined in our everyday vocabulary. When people say that they are prepared to take a risk they mean that in taking a particular decision they are willing to incur a chance of adverse consequences happening in the expectation of a probable benefit (ie a positive consequence). Intrinsic in that definition is that ‘risk’ should reflect both the likelihood that some form of harm may occur and a measure of the consequence.In everyday life though, we are more likely to pay attention to one than the other. (Great Britain and Health and Safety Executive, 2001)
	•	‘Risk’ is understood as an uncertain consequence of an event or an activity with respect to something that humans value, a definition originally used by Kates et al (1985, p21). (Renn, 2007a)
	•	Risks always refer to a combination of two components: the likelihood or chance of potential consequences and the severity of consequences of human activities, natural events or a combination of the two. Such consequences can be positive or negative, depending on the values that people associate with them. (Renn, 2007a)
	•	risks describe the potential effects that these hazards are likely to cause on specific targets such as buildings, ecosystems or human organisms and their related probabilities. (Renn, 2007a)
	•	The focus on risk should be seen as a segment of a larger and wider perspective on how humans transform the natural into a cultural environment with the aims of improving living conditions and serving human wants and needs (Turner et al, 1990). These transformations are performed with a purpose in mind (normally a benefit to those who initiate them). When implementing these changes, intended (or tolerated) and unintended consequences may occur that meet or violate other dimensions of what humans value. (Renn, 2007a)
	•	Risks are not taken for their own sake; rather they are actively or passively incurred because of their being an integral factor in the very activity that is geared towards achieving the particular human need or purpose. (Renn, 2007a)
	•	Risks are mental ‘constructions’ (OECD, 2003, p67). They are not real phenomena but originate in the human mind. (Renn, 2007b)
	•	risks represent what people observe in reality and what they experience. The link between risk as a mental concept and reality is forged through the experience of actual harm (the consequence of risk) in the sense that human lives are lost, health impacts can be observed, the environment is damaged or buildings collapse. 
	•	The invention of risk as a mental construct is contingent on the belief that human action can prevent harm in advance. Humans have the ability to design different futures; in other words they construct scenar- ios that serve as tools for the human mind to anticipate consequences in advance and change, within the constraints of nature and culture, the course of actions accordingly. (Renn, 2007b)
	•	Risks are created and selected by human actors. What counts as a risk to someone may be an act of God, or even an opportunity, for someone else. Although over time societies have gained experience and collective knowledge of the potential impacts of events and activities, one cannot anticipate all potential scenarios and be worried about all the many potential consequences of a proposed activity or an expected event. (Renn, 2007b)
	•	Since risks are mental constructs, the quality of their explanatory power depends on the accuracy and validity of their (real) predictions. (Renn, 2007b)
	•	Since risk is a mental construct there is a wide variety of construction princi- ples for conceptualizing it. (Renn, 2007b)
	•	The view that risks and hazards are distinct concepts is commonly held in the scholarly literature on risk especially in the English-speaking community. The dichotomy is also enshrined in key documents commissioned or developed by Governments to help regulators conceptualise, regulate and communicate harmful events. (Bouder, 2011)
	•	risk also encompasses the probability of exposure and its impact. (Renn, 2011)
	•	Risk takes into consideration both the hazard itself and the potential exposure.  (Skinner, 2011)
	•	risk is often quantified in terms of probabilities. (Swedish Chemicals Agency et al., 2007)
	•	"Risk" may be defined as a compound measure ofthe probability and magnitude of adverse effect. (Lowrance, 1980)
	•	I prefer to define "risk" as a compound measure of the probability and magnitude of adverse effect. (Lowrance, 1980)
	•	Thus a statement about "risk" is a description of the likelihood and consequences ofharmful effect. (Lowrance, 1980)
	•	Risk may be expressed in many ways: number of lives lost per year, or average shortening of lifespan, or degree of loss of hearing, or frequency of chromosomal mutations. (Lowrance, 1980)
	•	Once the size of a risk is estimated, whether by intuitive guestimate or by formal empirical analysis, larger personal and social decisions have to be made about whether to bear that risk, taking into account many normative factors. (Lowrance, 1980)
	•	for risks that have a long recorded history of repeated events, we know the odds. (Lowrance, 1980)
	•	Risks are probabilistic estimates of consequences related to both the hazard potential of the agent and the complex parameters of exposure. (Omenn, 2003)
	•	Douglas sees risk as a political weapon used by a society poised between the cultures of individualism and egalitarianism, to blame those who wield power in the state an big corporations for what happens to the rest of us. (Hood et al., 2001)
	•	Risk is opportunity, it is what makes possible the lucky break, the new prospect, and the chance to do. (Zedner, 2009)
	•	The concept of ‘risk’ is defined as a composition of the ‘impact’ (total of the consequences of the incident scenario) and ‘likelihood’ (a forecast about the occurrence of the incident scenario). (Bergmans et al., 2009)
	•	Risk, as described in Chapter 3, are the potential returns (consequences, effects, etc.) of an event. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Risks are inherently uncertain, and many people are unconfortable with uncertainty. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Risks are the potential returns from an event, where the returns are any changes, effects, consequences and so on, of the event. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	As some potential event becomes more likely or the returns of that event become more consequential, the higher becomes the risk. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Taken alone, either the likelihood or the return would be an unreliable indicator of the risk. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Risk is often conflated with other thinkgs, but is conceptually separate from the event, the threat that causes the event, and any other cause or source. Such conceptual distinctions help the analyst to clarify the risk, principall by tracing its sources through the process to potential returns. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Another common semantic error is the use of the phrase “the risk of” to mean “the chance of” something. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	When we speak of the risk of something, literally we mean the potential returns associated with that thing. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Risk is “a measurable uncertatinty” (Knight, 1921, p.26), a “measure of the probability and severity of adverse effects” (Lowrance, 1976), “the potential for unwanted or negative consequences of an event or activity” (Rowe, 1977), “a measurement of the chance of an outcome, the size of an outcome or a combination of both” (Ansell & Wharton, 1992, p4), “uncertainty and has an impact” (Carter, Handcocj, Morin, & Robins, 1994, p. 16), “the product of the probability and utility of some future event” (Adams, 1995, p. 30), “a measure of the amount of uncertainty that exists” and relates “primarily to the extent of your ability to predict a particular outcome with certainty” (Heerkens, 2002, p.142), “uncertain effect” (Chapman & Ward, 2003, p. 12), “a scenario followed by a policy proposal for how to prevent this scenario from becoming real” (Rasmussen 2006, p.2), “an uncertain (generally adverse) consequence of an event or activity with respect to something that humans value” (IRGC, 2008, p. 4), or “the likelihood and potential impact of encountering a threat” (Humanitarian Practice Network, 2010, p. xviii). (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Semantic analysis sometimes “frames” a concept as an actor, action, and object in some context. “The ‘risk’ frame crucially involves two notions – chance and harm” (Fillmore & Atkins, 1992, p. 80). (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Risk is “the possibility that something unpleasant will happen” or “a situation which puts a person in danger”. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	In general use, the noun risk is associated with harm, as in the phrase “a risk that this would happen” (Fillmore & Atkins, 1992, p. 81). (Newsome, 2013)
	•	The normative conception of risk as negative encourages actors to forget positive risks. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	The hazard and threats are sources of the risk in the sense that they are the actual actors or agents with the potential to harm, while the risk is the potential harm. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	The risk is the potential returns if the hazard were to be activated as a threat. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	In general use, risk is sometimes used as a verb to imply our voluntary exposure to some threat (as in: “I risked discovery by the enemy”). (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Risk is also used as a verd in front of some valued object representing what the actor has to lose (as in: “I risked my saving on that bet”) (Fillmore & Atkins, 1992, pp. 97, 100-101). (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Risk is potential returns. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Risk is a function of threats and vulnerabilities. It is the possibility of asset loss, damage, or destruction. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	Risk is the result of the likelihood that a specific vulnerability of a particular asset will be exploited by an adversary to cause a given consequence. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	A risk is a scenario followed by a policy proposal for how to prevent this scenario from becoming real. (Rasmussen, 2006)
	•	This risk makes insecurity the rule. (Rasmussen, 2004)
	•	Risks are socially constructed realities. According to Beck, the concepts of risk and risk society combine the discursive construction of risk and the materiality of threats. (Griner, 2002)
	•	Risks are intrinsically involved in public or private decision-making. Every decision involves a risk. (Griner, 2002)
	•	As risk is socially constructed, its definition and perception are discourse dependent and culturally relative. (Griner, 2002)
	•	Risk is becoming the operative concept of Western security. (Rasmussen, 2001)
	•	Risk has become the lingua franca of modern life. (Coker, 2009)
	•	Risk also drives the evolution of the institutions designed to address it. Chicago School theorists have long argued that powerful organizational practices shape regulation in their own interests (Gaskell 2007:95). (Coker, 2009)
	•	Risk is fundamentally a belief or attitude, a way of thinking about the world. To the extent that our social experience generates the suspicion that we are at risk most of the time we tend to feel even more anxious. (Coker, 2009)
	•	All risk concepts are based on the distinction between reality and possibility. The concept would not make sense if the future were predetermined, or independent of our own actions. Fears about the future are linked to anxieties about the outcomes that follow from our own actions. (Coker, 2009)
	•	Risks, in other words, have become a structural feature of advanced industrialization (Adam 2003:7). (Coker, 2009)
	•	They often arise from the fact that everything we do usually has side-effects. (Coker, 2009)
	•	Risks are not always based on objective assessments that we find in physics; they are subjective and embedded in culture. They are not always open to testing or validation. They are not always calculative. And that is the challenge because societies, like people, are not easily argued out of their fears. (Coker, 2009)
	•	Risks are real but they are also social constructions in so far (and perhaps only in so far) as the categories we use to perceive them are distinctive (Lewens 2007:135). In thinking about a risk we apply certain heuristics, or rules of thumb. (Coker, 2009)
	•	Risk has replaced threat as the centre of security studies. (Coker, 2009)
	•	There are two kinds of risk: risk as a product of a probability and the likely impact of an event once the probable actually happens, and risk as a necessary gamble for an immediate gain. (Coker, 2009)
	•	risk is central to life. If we are not willing to take risks we would face a real problem. (Coker, 2009)
	•	Risk, as the likelihood of “failure or prohibitive cost in pursuit of strategic, operational, or management objectives,” is an ever-present consideration for senior defense of cials. (Freier, 2009)
	•	Uncertainty and threat are integral components of the concept of risk. (Frühling, 2014)
	•	Risk arise from a combination of threats and uncertainty. (Frühling, 2014)
	•	The central recommendation that flows from approaching defence planning as risk management is thus the need for clarity and coherence in the defence planning framework. (Frühling, 2014)
	•	‘Risk’ is a term that is ubiquitous in everyday language, but relates to an abstract concept that is difficult to definein a way that is generally applicable to all situations.6 It ultimately arises from uncertainty. (Frühling, 2014)
	•	One general definition, from risk-management guidelines for the Australian public service, states that ‘risk’is the exposure to the possibility of such things as economic or financial loss or gain, physical damage, injury or delay, as a consequence of pursuing aparticular course of action. The concept of risk has two elements, the likelihood of something happeningand the consequences if it happens. (Frühling, 2014)
	•	‘Risk’ is thus a multi-dimensional concept. (Frühling, 2014)
	•	risk arises from uncertainty. (Frühling, 2014)
	•	For the term ‘risk’ (Lat.: ‘risicare’ navigate aroundcliffs; Fr.: ‘risque’; It.: ‘risico, risco’; Sp.: ‘riesgo’; Port.: ‘risco’; Ger.: ‘Risiko’) many synonyms are used: danger, peril, jeopardy, hazard; chance, gamble, possibility, speculation, uncertainty, venture; unpredictability, precariousness, instability, insecurity, perilousness, riskiness, probability, likelihood, threat, menace, fear, prospect. (Brauch, 2011)
	•	For Webster’s Third International Dictionary ‘risk’ means “1. the possibility of loss, injury, disadvantage, or destruction: contingency, danger, peril, threat ...; 2. someone or something that creates or suggests a hazard or adverse chance: a dangerous element or factor ...; 3. the chance of loss or the perils to the subject matter or insurance covered by the contract; the degree of probability of such loss; amount at risk; a person or thing judged as a specified hazard to an insurer; an insurance hazard from a cause or source (war, disaster); 4. the product of the amount that may be lost and the probability of losing it” (Gove 2002: 1961). (Brauch, 2011)
	•	Langenscheidt-Longman (1995) defines ‘risk’ as: “1. possibility of bad result: the possibility that some- thing bad, unpleasant, or dangerous may happen ...; 2. take a risk: to decide to do something even though you know it may have bad results; 3. at risk: be in a sit- uation where you may be harmed ...; 4. run a risk: to be in a situation where there is a risk of something bad happening to you ...; 5. at the risk of doing some- thing: used when you think that what you are going to say or do may have a bad result, may offend or annoy people etc.; 6. at your own risk: if you do something at your own risk, you do it even though you under- stand the possible dangers and have been warned about them; 7. cause of dangers: something or someone that is likely to cause harm or danger...; 8. insurance/business: a person or business judged ac- cording the danger involved in giving them insurance or lending them money” (Langenscheidt-Longman 1995). (Brauch, 2011)
	•	The Oxford Guide to the English Language gives this concise definition: “possibility of meeting danger or suffering harm; person or thing representing a source of risk” (Weiner/Hawkins 1985). (Brauch, 2011)
	•	Besides these many meanings of this term in con- temporary American and British English, the ‘risk’ concept has been employed in many natural and social science disciplines as a concept that is also widely used by policy-makers to justify specific policy goals and programmes. (Brauch, 2011)
	•	Risk is a prominent feature of contemporary or- ganizations and their environments: the production of risk has become as important as that of wealth (Tsoukas, 1999), and managers are increasingly having to engage in risk management (Power, 2007; Smallman, 1996). (Maguire and Hardy, 2013)
	•	Despite some positive associations, such as taking advantage of opportunities, risk is increasingly likely to refer to “negative and undesirable consequences” (Gephart et al., 2009: 141), the “anticipation of catastrophe” (Beck, 2006: 332), or “the chance of mishap” (Cranor, 2007: 38). (Maguire and Hardy, 2013)
	•	Risk is an inherent part of business and public life. Dynamic market relations increase the uncertainty of the environment where business and public organizations work. (Tchankova, 2002)
	•	Risk covers all aspects of organizational activities and it is included in all management levels. (Tchankova, 2002)
	•	risks have to be individually assessed in terms of the likelihood they will arise, the vulnerability of society to them, and the impact they will have if they do occur. (Omand, 2014)
	•	Insurance can be defined as a technology of risk. In fact, the term 'risk' which one finds being used nowadays apropos of everything has no precise meaning other than as a category of this technology. Risk neologism of insurance, said to derive from the Italian word which meant 'that which cut?, hence 'reef and consequently 'risk to cargo on the high seas'. Say's Dictionary of Political Economy states that theory of insurance rests on the fundamental notion of risk'. The notion of risk is likewise central to the juridical definition of insurance: “ risk is the fundamental element of insurance, since it is the very object of this type of contract'. Risk constitutes an essential element of insurance, the fundamental element, even, for Picard and Besson who add: ‘this notion of risk is specific in its origin to the law and science of insurance, and  differs markedly from the notion of risk utilised in civil law and everyday speech'. So what is this thing called risk.  (Foucault et al., 1991)
	•	In everyday language the term 'risk' is understood as a synonym for danger or peril, for some unhappy event which may happenit to someone; it designates an objective threat. (Foucault et al., 1991)
	•	In insurance the term designate neither an event nor a general kind of event occurring in reality (the unfortunate kind), but a specific mode of treatment of certain events capable of happening to a group of individuals - or, more exactly, to values or capitals possessed or represented by a collectivity of individuals: that is to say, a population. (Foucault et al., 1991)
	•	Nothing is a risk in itself; there is no risk in reality. But on the other hand, anything can be a risk. (Foucault et al., 1991)
	•	everything can be a risk, in so far as the type of event it falls under can be treated according to the principle of insurance technology. (Foucault et al., 1991)
	•	Risk is calculable. This is the essential point, whereby insurance is radically distinct from a bet or a lottery. For an event to be a risk, it must be possible be possible to evaluate its probability. (Foucault et al., 1991)
	•	Risk is collective. Whereas an accident, as damage, suffering, is always individual, striking at one and not another, a risk of accident affects a population. Strictly speaking there is no such thing as an  individual risk; otherwise insurance would be no more than a wager. Risk only becomes something calculable when it is spread over a population. (Foucault et al., 1991)
	•	To calculate a risk is to master time, to discipline the future. (Foucault et al., 1991)
	•	insurance is a technique of reparation and indeminification of damages.  (Foucault et al., 1991)
	•	Insurance contributes substantially towards the solidarization of interests. It constitutes a mode of association which allows its participants to agree, on the rule of justice they will subscribe to. (Foucault et al., 1991)
	•	Insurance allows enterprise, and hence multiplies wealth. (Foucault et al., 1991)
	•	here are two key factors here, both of them pioneered by the insurance companies. One is a mathematical form, the technique of probabilistic calculation which ensures the certainty of the  institutions' operations, disciplining the future and ensuring that their combinations are more than a mere lottery. The other is the juridical form of the insurance contract. The person who pays a premium acquires a right of indemnity; the company he or she contracts with has obligations towards that person which are juridical as well as moral. Insurance allows security to be simultaneously contractualized, legalized and juridicalized. (Foucault et al., 1991)
	•	La liste des risques s’allongent en permanence en raison des progrès technologiques mais il importe surtout de souligner que les risques se mesurent par deux paramètres : leur probabilité ou fréquence et leur gravité ou sévérité. (Dumont, 2011)
Risky
	•	The adjective risky can be used to designate specific types of risk factor, such as “risk lifestyle” (Kenney & Van Brunschot, 2009, p. 2). (Newsome, 2013)
Active risks
	•	For active risks, those that the individual performing the activity has some control over, the marketplace provides at least a rudimentary, though imperfect, way of addressing safety issues. (Perrow, 1999)
	•	[…] active risks are attractive; we like to take some risks, if we feel we have personal control over them. (Perrow, 1999)
Risk analysis
	•	Risk analysis can tell you to very fine degrees the probability of a particular event happening, with a one in a million chance, one in a thousand, one in a hundred, and so on (Douglas, 2005:30)
	•	Risk analysis that tries to exclude moral ideas and politics from its calculations is putting professional integrity before sense (Douglas, 2005:44)
	•	risk analysis is promoted as a method for framing all aspects of governance activities (Rothstein and alt., 2013:216)
	•	Risk analysis has long been associated with the governance of environmental and human health and safety hazards, such as radiation, food, and chemicals (Rothstein and alt., 2013:216)
	•	Risk analysis is regularly used to qualify advice to government and the public about adverse events in probabilistic terms, be it the likelihood of serious flooding, terrorist attacks or changes in GDP. (Rothstein and alt., 2013:219)
	•	risk analysis to help build what management consultants like to call a “no surprises culture,” in which adverse events can at least be better anticipated, if not avoided (Rothstein and alt., 2013:220)
	•	[…] risk analysis as a means of framing information-gathering activities […] (Rothstein and alt., 2013:228)
	•	Risk analysis is itself part of this organizational construction of risk from uncertainty. (Power, 2009) 
	•	Risk analysis scholarship and practice also flourished in the area of technological failure and crisis management (Power, 2009) 
	•	The development of risk analysis exhibits an ever-expanding frontier of formalization in which techniques are applied to new uncertainties and new risks are measured. (Power, 2009)
	•	The ambition of risk analysis to model recalcitrant or complex interacting hazard phenomena effectively transforms acts of god into possibilities for rational decision-making and policy. (Power, 2009) 
	•	risk analysis can be understood as an over- lapping family of methods for the calculation and measurement of risk based in the statistical sciences. (Power, 2009)
	•	risk analysis cannot progress as a mathematically isolated discipline; it needs to take some account of public risk perceptions (Power, 2009)
	•	Risk, however, is increasingly emerging as a key organising concept for regulatory regimes and extended governance systems within a wide range of policy domains and organisational settings (Rothstein et al., 2006)
	•	Risk analyses typically model the impacts of an unfortunate event (such as an accident, a discovery of pollution, sabotage, product tampering) in terms of direct harm to victims—deaths, injuries, and damages (Slovic, 1987)
	•	The challenge is to discover characteristics associated with an event and the way that it is managed that can predict the breadth and seriousness of those impacts. (Slovic, 1987)
	•	The point is that traditional economic and risk analyses tend to neglect these higher order impacts, hence they greatly underestimate the costs associated with certain kinds of events. (Slovic, 1987)
	•	Modern risk analysis has its twin roots in mathematical theories of probability, and in scientific methods for identifying causal links between adverse health effects and different types of hazardous activities. (Covello and Mumpower, 1986)
	•	In recent years risk analysis has emerged as an identifiable discipline and profession, with its own societies, annual meetings, journals, and practitioners. In the last decade alone, the risk analysis literature has grown from a handful of articles and books to a formidable collection of material. (Covello and Mumpower, 1986)
	•	Risk analysis applies methods of analysis to matters of risk. Its aim is to increase understanding of the substantive qualities, seriousness, likelihood, and conditions of a hazard or risk and of the options for managing it. Risk analysis is both a profession and an intellectual discipline. These principles are meant to guide both the practice and use of risk analysis. (Paustenbach, 2002c)
	•	Risk analysis uses observations about what we know to make predictions about what we don't know. Risk analysis is a fundamentally science-based process that strives to reflect the realities of Nature in order to provide useful information for decisions about managing risks. Risk analysis seeks to inform, not to dictate, the complex and difficult choices among possible measures to mitigate risks. Risk analysis enriches fair and transparent deliberative decision-making processes in a democratic society. (Paustenbach, 2002c)
	•	Risk analysis seeks to integrate knowledge about the fundamental physical, biological. social. cultural, and economic processes that determine human, environmental, and technological responses to a diverse set of circumstances. (Paustenbach, 2002c)
	•	Risk analysis relies on both basic and applied research, often integrating information, theories, and analytic tools from a variety of disciplines. As we apply information and tools from diverse disciplines, we seek to give due respect and acknowledgment to the intellectual contributions of those fields while using information standards and criteria appropriate to the policy choices that are at issue. (Paustenbach, 2002c)
	•	The principal methods used for hazard and risk analysis are quasi-formal techniques designed to facilities the process of hazard identification and risk evaluation by directing the thought process of the analysis along certain lines. (Wells, 1996)
	•	As risk analysis incorporates a variety of methods to identify and evaluate risks, various groups present competing evidence based upon their own perceptions and social agenda (Kasperson et al., 1988)
	•	risk analysis and characterization as an "analytic and deliberative process," whose task is "to describe a potentially hazardous situation in as accurate, thorough, and decision relevant a manner as possible, addressing the significant concerns of the interested and affected parties, and to make this information understandable and accessible to public officials and the parties" (Stern and Fineberg 1996, p. 2). (Pidgeon et al., 2003)
	•	The discipline of risk analysis grew out in the late 1960’s and the 1970’s, largely as a response to growing public opposition to new technologies. From the beginning the discipline has had a strong focus of attention on risks that are subject to public opposition, such as nuclear energy and chemicals. (Swedish Chemicals Agency et al., 2007)
	•	Risk analysis is a multi-disciplinary field that uses methods from the natural, behavioural, and social sciences. Major areas of study include risk perception, risk communication, risk-benefit analysis, and various industrial applications such as fault tree analysis. (Swedish Chemicals Agency et al., 2007)
	•	Risk analysis as a regulatory driver has now become firmly entrenched in public health and environmental protection. (van Calster, 2008)
	•	Risk analysis at any level essentially has to accommodate two gut feelings of the constituency: whether society should be risk-prone or risk averse, and whether government and its institutions can be trusted to make the necessary decisions with a high or a low degree of discretion. (van Calster, 2008)
	•	Knowing (identifying) and understanding the risks are parts of risks analysis. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Analyze the risks: a. Identify the risks. b. Understand the risks by relating them to their sources. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Risk analysis helps to identify and understand the risks ahead of risk assessment (appreciating and calculating the risk), which in turn is a practical step toward choosing which negative risks should be controlled and which positive risks should be pursued and how to communicate our risk management. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Analyzing the risk involves identifying the risk and disaggregating the risk from its source to its potential returns (Digrammatic help for analysing risk is shown in Figure 4.3.) A proper analysis allows us to assess the likelihood of each part of the chain; if we had not assessed the risks, we could hardly imagine either controlling all the actual risks or efficiently choosing the most urgent risks to control. (Newsome, 2013)
Effective risk analysis
	•	Better analysis of risk would not prevent political perversities, but would counter poor analysis. (Newsome, 2013)
Poor risk analysis
	•	Poor analysis and assessment of risk leads to mismanagement of risks by, for instance, justifying the allocation of resources to controls on misidentified sources of risk or on minor risks. (Newsome, 2013)
Risk analysis methodology
	•	The methodology of risk analysis, including the calculation of expectation values, can be seen as a decision aid, the outcome of which should be taken into account by decision-makers along with various other considerations. However, many proponents of risk analysis make a much stronger claim than that. They claim that a rational decision-maker is bound to judge risk issues in accordance with these expectation values (“risks”), so that an outcome with a smaller expectation value (“risk”) is always preferred to an outcome with a larger expectation value. (Swedish Chemicals Agency et al., 2007)
Risk analysts
	•	risk analysts cannot achieve purity nor that they cannot stand forever on the side lines (Douglas, 2005:44)
	•	risk analysts concerned with as diverse subjects as quality control, chemical toxicity levels, epidemiology, and accidents in the workplace. (Power, 2009)
	•	risk assessors are increasingly moving from the first to the second (from bounded rationality to cultural rationality) (Perrow, 1999)
	•	Unlike modern risk analysts, who express their results in terms of mathematical probabilities and confidence intervals, the Asipu of ancient Babylonia expressed their results with certainty, confidence, and authority. (Covello and Mumpower, 1986)
	•	Making projections about the future is always a risky enterprise, especially in an area as complex as risk analysis and risk management. (Covello and Mumpower, 1986)
	•	Because decisions about risks arc usually needed when knowledge is incomplete, risk analysts rely on informed judgment and on models reflecting plausible interpretations of the realities of Nature. We do this with a commitment to assess and disclose the basis of our judgments and the uncertainties in our knowledge. (Paustenbach, 2002c)
	•	Risk analysts are committed to maintaining and building our professional community as we contribute to advances in our field. We review the work of our peers and help students develop their skills and values. Unless prohibited, we share the data underlying our published analyses in order to facilitate independent reassessment of our own conclusions. (Paustenbach, 2002c)
	•	The analyst cannot simply aim at any particular time to study all hazards but must restrict the study to the area of interest at that time. This can be done by paying particular attention to the way incident develop (Wells, 1996)
	•	Risk analysts have fought hard to create a clear distinction between the facts and values of risk management (Fischhoff, 1995)
	•	Risk analysts often seem unaware of such issues, or at least uncomfortable with them. Their assigned job is to produce estimates, not determine social values. (Fischhoff, 1995)
	•	Risk analysts consequently distinguish between aleatory and epistemic uncertainty. (Renn, 2007b)
Risk–risk analysis
	•	Risk–risk analysis to compare the risks targeted by the regulation to the risks that may arise from a substitute product or activity. (Dudley, 2014)
Risk-based approach
	•	“risk-based” approaches comprise a wide range of mechanisms of control, most notably taking the form of what has become known as “risk-based regulation,” but also involving – as the term “governance” connotes – a plurality of public and private actors, instruments, and purposes (Braithwaite et al. 2007) (Rothstein and alt., 2013:215)
	•	“risk- based” approaches pay attention to both the probability and impact of potential adverse outcomes (Rothstein and alt., 2013:216)
	•	risk-based approaches are held to improve the accountability of decisionmaking by providing formal ex-ante rationalizations of the limits of what governance interventions can, and should, seek to achieve (Rothstein and alt., 2013:217)
	•	In analysing governance problems, risk-based approaches probabilistically qualify predictions, such as which areas are most likely to flood or which firms are most likely to mis-sell financial products. (Rothstein and alt., 2013:217)
	•	In setting governance goals, risk-based approaches express how far governance should intervene to manage, rather than eliminate, adverse outcomes, such as setting acceptable probabilities of cancer from exposure to toxic chemicals or acceptable probabilities of financial meltdown from the use of complex financial instruments (Rothstein and alt., 2013:217)
	•	in modifying governed behaviours, risk-based approaches can help allocate scarce compliance resources to achieve optimal, rather than complete, achievement of policy goals, such as targeting anti-terrorist campaigns on communities deemed susceptible to violent radicalization or targeting child-protection interventions on those children most vulnerable to abuse (Rothstein and alt., 2013:217)
	•	risk-based approaches are not neutral devices, but policy tools, which as Lascoumes and Le Galès (2007) argue, embody particular ideas about the purposes of governance and relationships between “governors” and “governed” that may not find universal application (Rothstein and alt., 2013:218)
	•	risk-based approaches, as calculative modes of accountability (Rothstein and alt., 2013:223)
	•	risk-based regulation is simultaneously a discourse of opportunity which emphasizes a domain of freedom for those who can 'prove' they are less risky. (Power, 2009)
	•	risk-based governance is about prioritising activities according to the impact and probability of societal risks, whether for standard-setting or compliance purposes (Rothstein et al., 2006)
	•	the risk-based approach provides a mechanism for constructive dialogue between the regulator and the regulated (McQuaid, 2007)
	•	Risk-based policy-making can make sense in many occasions. (Skinner, 2011) 
	•	a risk-based approach encourages us to think explicitly in terms of costs and benefits. (Thomson, 2012)
	•	risk-based approaches emerged in American health, safety and environmental law. (Burgess et al., 2016)
	•	This is clearly happened in the environmental field where the risk-based debate was introduced by experts in risk-assessment techniques before being picked up by mainstream policymaking. (Burgess et al., 2016)
	•	Risk-based approaches to governance normally aim at eliminating or at least reducing harm to the health, safety and property of the population. (Burgess et al., 2016)
	•	One of the key means through which risk-based governance oes this is anticipation of the basis of scientific risk assessments. On the basis of this forwad-looking knowledge, governance also promise to be more effective and efficient because governance resources, such as money, authority and rules, as well as information, would be allocated to where the risk is greatest (Black, 2005, Rothstein et al., 2006). (Burgess et al., 2016)
	•	It is possible to discern a number of key characteristics of risk-based approaches to governance. First, risk-based approaches to governance often assign a substantial role in policymaking to the advise of technical experts and scientists. Moreover, risk-based politcy making tends to be centralized in order to ensure consistency, greater efficiency and efficacy in the allocation of governance resources as a result of centralized assessments of risk. Third, given the emphasis on anticipating harm, risk-based governance in general aims at preventing or at least controlling harmfull processes and products. This is normally undertaken trhough risk-based standard setting that involves the quantitative definition of safety foals and standards, delineating safe from unsae practices and processes and acceptable from unacceptable risks. (Burgess et al., 2016)
	•	Resiliecence-oriented governance may imply only modest changes to risk-based governance. (Burgess et al., 2016)
	•	Risk-based decisionmaking and risk-based approaches in decisionmaking are terms frequently used to indicate that some systemic process that deals with uncertainties is being used to formulate policy options and assess their various distributional impacts and ramifications. (Haimes, 2009)
Risk-based tool
	•	In the more self-consciously risk-based systems the use of technical risk-based tools derived from economics and science are portrayed as an integral part of the broader systematisation of regulation. (Hutter, 2005)
	•	More generally the risk approach centres on determining probability and impact factors, deciding on regulatory response, the development of regulatory tools and most importantly informing allocative decisions in deploying limited resources. (Hutter, 2005)
Risk-based approach to defence planning
	•	a risk-based approach to defence planning implicitly assumes that a country’s military posture is defensive rather than aggressive—which is undoubtedly the case for Australia. Note also, that there is nothing in my definition to preclude non-military remedies. It will often be more cost effective to prevent a problem from emerging through diplomacy or foreign aid than to threaten or employ armed force. (Thomson, 2012)
	•	at a fundamental level defence planning really is about managing strategic risk. (Thomson, 2012)
	•	defence and strategic planning begins and ends with the management of strategic risk. (Thomson, 2012)
	•	A contemporary risk management defense strategy should adhere to and be judged against eight principles. (Freier, 2009)
	•	Integration of DoD into a whole-of-government approach for avoiding or preventing the most dangerous future con icts. Success of a risk management defense strategy relies on synchronized interagency efforts that together focus on avoiding or preventing the most dangerous con icts in the firrst place. (Freier, 2009)
	•	Optimization for persistent management of violent unconventional threats. Among the least preventable future defense-relevant challenges are failures of governance whose second- and third-order impacts threaten U.S. interests unconventionally. (Freier, 2009)
	•	Acknowledgement of a defense-relevant, unconventional world beyond the War on Terror (WoT). Current trends threaten over-optimization of defense strategy and capabilities for operations in the Middle East from a regional perspective, and counterterrorism and classical counterinsurgency from a functional one. (Freier, 2009)
	•	Recalibration of contingency plans for pursuit of limited strategic and operational objectives. Adoption of a risk management defense strategy requires that future military (and whole-of-government) campaigns pursue more realistic and limited strategic and operational aims. (Freier, 2009)
	•	Pursuit of institutional change conforming to the "art of the possible and necessary" versus the "desirable and ideal." (Freier, 2009)
	•	Integration of holistic homeland security (HLS) demands in strategy, planning, and capabilities development. (Freier, 2009)
	•	the concept of risk management as a founding principle for contemporary defense strategy development. (Freier, 2009)
	•	it outlines the eight key strategic principles that should be at the core of important near-term defensedecisions.These eight principles are touchstones against whichsenior DoD leaders and defense planners evaluate the ef cacy of future options. They inject realism, rigor, and strategic precision into future DoD plans and programs. The principles are: 1. Integration of DoD into a whole-of-government approach for avoiding or preventing the most dangerous future con icts. 2. Optimization of strategy and key defense capabilities for persistent management of violent unconventional threats. 3. Acknowledgement of a defense-relevant, unconventional world beyond the War on Terror (WoT). 4. Recalibration of contingency plans for pursuit of limited strategic and operational objectives. 5. Pursuit of institutional change conforming to the "art of the possible and necessary" versus the "desirable and ideal." 6. Recognition that prevention and response are zero sum propositions. 7. Incorporation of unthinkable but still plausible “strategic shocks” in future defense planning. 8. Integration of holistic homeland security (HLS) demands in strategy, planning, and capabilities development. (Freier, 2009)
	•	Unconventional threats and challenges are at the center of a contemporary risk management strategy. (Freier, 2009)
	•	prevention and deterrence are cornerstones of a risk management defense strategy. (Freier, 2009)
	•	risk management is the only viable course for defense strategy over the near- and mid-term. Risk should be identified and mitigated according to a very clear set of strategic priorities. (Freier, 2009)
	•	A risk management defense strategy will only succeed if and when the other—often more appropriate—instruments of national power are integrated into a single, seamless strategic design. (Freier, 2009)
	•	accepting some increase in traditional risk is essential to the success of a risk management defense strategy that is by necessity more focused on a range of defense-relevant unconventional threats and challenges. (Freier, 2009)
	•	Managing risk is a central element of the defense strategy. It involves balancing the demands of the present against preparations for the future consistent with the strategy's priorities. It entails assuring allies and friends, deterring threats of coercion and aggression, and, when necessary, defeating adversaries. It involves maintaining military advantages and developing new military competencies while dissuading future military competitors. (Department of Defense, 2001)
	•	This risk framework is made up of four related dimensions: Force management - the ability to recruit, retain, train, and equip sufficient numbers of quality personnel and sustain the readiness of the force while accomplishing its many operational tasks; Operational - the ability to achieve military objectives in a near- term conflict or other contingency; Future challenges - the ability to invest in new capabilities and develop new operational concepts needed to dissuade or defeat mid- to long-term military challenges; and Institutional - the ability to develop management practices and controls that use resources efficiently and promote the effective operation of the Defense establishment. (Department of Defense, 2001)
	•	This framework allows the Department to consider tradeoffs among fundamental objectives and fundamental resource constraints, and it reflects DoD's experiences over the last decade in attempting to balance strategy, force structure, and resources. (Department of Defense, 2001)
	•	By assessing the Defense establishment in these four areas, the Department is directly addressing the issues associated with developing and assessing the operational force, key enabling capabilities, and its supporting deployment and industrial infrastructure. (Department of Defense, 2001)
	•	Uncertainty and threat are integral components of the concept of risk, and it is in reaction to strategic risks – risk that arise from, or could be reduced by, the use of armed force – that most countries maintain defence force. (Frühling, 2014)
	•	Considering defence planning as the management of strategic risk helps to identigy core judgements and their consequences in coherent defence planning. (Frühling, 2014)
	•	In the discourse on strategy and defence planning, the term ‘risk’ is as common as it is ill-defined. Often it is used to denote the danger of failing to reconcile ends and means. (Frühling, 2014)
	•	See as a mismatch between ends and means, ‘risk” can become synonymous with bad strategy, as a necessary evil that could, in theory, be radically reduced or eliminated by an adjustment of ends, means or ways of strategy. (Frühling, 2014)
	•	The US Department of Defense even defined ‘risk’ as broadly as all ‘the issues and factors that can undermine the ability of the organization to achieve the goals of defence policy’. (Frühling, 2014)
	•	defence planning is always about the management of strategic risk, although the types and characteristics of risks to be managed change over time. (Frühling, 2014)
	•	The cleanup strategy is a risk-based approach that focuses fist on those contaminant plumes and sources that are the greatest contributors to risk. ((U.S.), 2011)
	•	A risk-based approach is beneficial because it helps to avoid unnecessary risks as well as incorporates both financial and intangible benegits and drawbacks into the calculation. (Forest, 2007)
	•	Risk-benefit analyses are not new in the defense world. For instance, the Joint Manual on Risk Management contains a standardized approach to assessing and managing risk, which can be applied to all activities. This risk-based approach should be applied to contractor sourcing decisions. (Forest, 2007)
	•	The process consists of five steps. They are (1) identify hazard; (2) assess hazard to determine risk in terms of probability, severity, and risk level; (3) develop ways to mitigate the risks and make decisions about risk; (4) implement the mitigation processes; and (5) supervise and evaluate. (Forest, 2007)
	•	In 2001, the Department of Defense (DOD) established a risk management framework to use in considering trade-offs among defense objectives and resource constraints. The framework consists of four dimensions of risk with supporting performance measures that are being cascaded to the defense agencies and activities as well as departmentwide. Although not depicted, financial considerations underlay each of DOD’s risk areas. (Office, 2004)
	•	risk management framework to assist decision makers in formulating top-down strategy, balancing investment priorities against risk over time, measuring near-and midterm outputs against strategic goals, and focusing on actual performance results. (Office, 2005)
	•	According to DOD officials, the risk management framework also was intended to increase transparency within the department over the decision-making process. (Office, 2005)
	•	To assess the extent to which DOD has implemented the risk management framework, we analyzed key documents, policy guidance, data, and interview results, and compared the analysis to the principles for managing risk and results identified in prior GAO reports. In addition, we conducted interviews with DOD and service officials, and members of the Joint Staff. (Office, 2005)
	•	To identify the most significant challenges DOD faced in implementing the risk management framework, we analyzed documents, data, and interview results, and compared the results of this analysis to the key practices to assist mergers and organizational transformation identified in prior GAO reports. (Office, 2005)
	•	the goal of risk management is to integrate systematic concern for risk into the usual cycle of agency decision making and implementation. (Office, 2005)
	•	A risk management cycle represents a series of analytical and managerial steps, basically sequential, that can be used to assess risk, evaluate alternatives for reducing risks, choose among those alternatives, implement the alternatives, monitor their implementation, and continually use new information to adjust and revise the assessments and actions, as needed. (Office, 2005)
	•	Adoption of a risk management cycle such as this can aid in assessing risk by determining which vulnerabilities should be addressed, and how they should be addressed, within available resources. (Office, 2005)
	•	Risk management’s objectives are essentially the same as those of good management, and they are consistent with the broad economy and efficiency objectives of good government—namely, to provide better outcomes for the same amount of money, or to provide the same outcomes with less money. (Office, 2005)
	•	Therefore, risk management’s objectives are also compatible with those of the federal government’s results-oriented management approach, which was enacted in the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) of 1993,11 and the balanced scorecard approach. (Office, 2005)
	•	use a risk mitigation approach for balancing force, resource, and modernization requirements across defense planning timelines. (Office, 2005)

	•	the risk management framework by substituting the four dimensions of risk—force management, operational, future challenges, and institutional—for the scorecard’s four management areas. (Office, 2005)
	•	The risk management framework was to be a transformational tool that would provide a balanced perspective of the organization’s execution of strategy and ensure a top-down approach. (Office, 2005)
	•	risk management framework with decision support processes for planning, programming, and budgeting and with related reform initiatives into a coherent, unified management approach. (Office, 2005)
	•	The goal of both risk management and results- oriented management is to integrate the systematic concern for risk and performance into the usual cycle of agency decision making and implementation. (Office, 2005)
	•	risk management framework are to define risks and develop performance measures
	•	risk management framework, to strategically balance the allocation of resources across the spectrum of its investment priorities against risk over time and to monitor performance. (Office, 2005)
	•	DOD agreed that tracking progress in implementing the risk management framework is a good management practice. DOD stated that it has established goals and timelines for the risk management framework that are unique to the individual metrics, or measures, and that because the risk management framework continually evolves over time, new metrics will be developed while others may be retired. (Office, 2005)
	•	successful change management efforts use implementation goals—such as, for example, linking the risk management framework to the budget—and timelines for meeting those goals, to pinpoint shortfalls and gaps, suggest midcourse corrections, and build momentum by demonstrating progress. (Office, 2005)
	•	a risk management framework to ensure that current defense needs are balanced against future requirements. (Office, 2004)
	•	emphasized the need to link resources to capabilities and the risk management framework. (Office, 2004)
	•	As a result, resource allocations may not reflect the priorities of the defense strategy, including its new capabilities-based approach and the risk management framework.
	•	linking resource plans to its risk management framework and capabilities assessment. (Office, 2004)
	•	risk management framework such that assessments of capabilities could be made in terms of the risk management framework, which balances dimensions of risk, such as near term operational risk versus risks associated with mid- to long-term military challenges. (Office, 2004)
Net assessment-based planning
	•	net assessment-based planning to meet the risk of conflict in the present and near future, with one known and understood adversary. (Frühling, 2014)
	•	In practice, the use of deduction in the defenceplanning context is best known as ‘net assessment’. (Frühling, 2014)
	•	In order to come to a robust conclusion about the outcome of a conflict through net assessment, quantitative and qualitative information about both sides’ armed forces and society is complemented with information about how, and to what ends, their forces would most likely be used. (Frühling, 2014)
	•	Net assessment thus deduces from each side’s capabilities and intentions (the ‘case’: for example, North Korea’s observed belligerence, force structure and force posture), strategies and operational concepts as well as physical, psychological, social and political cause–effect relationships (the ‘rules’: including North Korean doctrine, its likely operational plans, South Korea’s andUS forces and plans, and the effects of geography), to the most likely outcome of a particular conflict or situation (the ‘result’: in this case, the likely consequences of a North Korean attack). (Frühling, 2014)
	•	Net assessment can thus be a powerful tool to define defence requirements, as it gives confidence in the sufficiency and necessity of its conclusions, and relate them most closely and strongly to the information that is available about the adversary. (Frühling, 2014)
	•	net assessment can only be applied if a specific adversary with the capability and intention to threaten one’s own interests is identified. (Frühling, 2014)
	•	defence planning based on net assessment is also often referred to as ‘threat-based planning’ – although any kind of risk must involve a ‘threat’ of some sort. (Frühling, 2014)
	•	net assessment can be used to guide defence planning even if there are no observable intentions on the part of the ‘adversary’ to impinge on one’s national interests with armed force. (Frühling, 2014)
	•	net assessment can be used to guide defence planning even if there are no observable intentions on the part of the ‘adversary’ to impinge on one’s national interests with armed force. (Frühling, 2014)
	•	net assessment cannot be used to infer requirements if there are substantial uncertainties about the identity, intentions or capabilities of possible adversaries. (Frühling, 2014)
	•	Net assessment would be used to determine the degree to which one’s baseline forces or proposed additions are adequate for dealing with those of the adversary. (Frühling, 2014)
Mobilization planning
	•	mobilization planning to meet the risk of conflict in the future, at an uncertain time and from a threat that is yet to develop. (Frühling, 2014)
Portfolio planning
	•	portfolio planning, where the defence force must be able to configure itself to meet several different risks, and concurrency judgements are of central importance. (Frühling, 2014)
Task-based planning
	•	task-based planning, where uncertainty about the circumstances in which the defence force might be used is so great that planning has to focus on the ability to conduct basic military tasks. (Frühling, 2014)
Risk-based approach to strategic balance
	•	a risk-based approach to a strategically balanced force that assesses alternative postures and the viability of competing force concepts in mitigating national risk in a resource-constrained environment. (Mauk, 2010)
	•	This type of assessment requires a systems approach to accommodate the great number of environmental variables to be considered. The intent is to qualify facts about the security environment in terms of what is or is not known, what is assumed, and ultimately, to identify what is most important to the nation. Interests must then be considered in the context of national values and relative risk. (Mauk, 2010)
Risk-based approach to security
	•	What I have attempted to show in this chapter is that the risk age has produced a much more explicit, long-term and risk-based approach to security analysis which, unfortunately, has not made us feel any more secure. (Coker, 2009)
Risk categorization
	•	Risk are routenly categorized by type. Categories help to communicate the scope of the risk, to assign the responsible authority to handle the risk, to understand the causes of the risk, and to suggest strategies for controlling. (Newsome, 2013)

Risk communication 
	•	Risk communication processes may in fact involve the participation of non-experts in risk regulation regimes, but they are increasingly framed as an organizational strategy to manage public expectations (Power, 2009)
	•	Risk communication is often defined in ways similar to that offered by Covello (1992), who wrote of the “process of exchanging information among interested parties about the nature, magnitude, significance, or control of a risk” (p. 359). (Janoske et al., 2012)
	•	Risk communication often focuses on developing and conveying messages prior to and during an event, and crisis communication focuses on doing so post-event. (Janoske et al., 2012)
	•	risk communication gets off on the wrong foot when the potential sources of information have no intent of saying anything. (Fischhoff, 1995)
	•	People need information about both the risks and the benefits of any activity that might affect them (Fischhoff, 1995)
	•	Within an organization, it means adding the skills of analysts capable of estimating benefits (both economists and specialists in consequences that cannot be readily monetized). Externally, it means acknowledging the public’s right to compensation for risk. That compensation might include reductions in other risks, as well as more conventional payments (e.g., tax abatements, jobs) (Fischhoff, 1995)
	•	[…]the descriptive literature on risk communication can help predict which issues will get out of hand or escape needed attention in the absence of deliberate competent communication. (Fischhoff, 1995)
	•	[…] effective risk communication can fulfil part of the social contract between those who create risks (as a by product of other activities) and those who bear them (perhaps along with the benefits of those activities). (Fischhoff, 1995)
	•	Risk communication may be defined as the flow of information and risk evaluations back and forth between academic experts, regulatory practitioners, interest groups, and the general public. (Leiss, 1996)
	•	[…] risk communication researchers have married their knowledge about risk assessment and management issues with the approaches used in the field of modern communication theory and practice. (Leiss, 1996)
	•	Risk communication research has been able to draw on this resource and adapt its findings to the particular concerns of the risk studies area, and as a result it has made substantial progress in a relatively short time. (Leiss, 1996)
	•	Slovic and MacGregor have diagnosed the main problem well: Although attention to communication can prevent blunders that exacerbate conflict, there is rather little evidence that risk communication has made any significant contribution to reducing the gap between technical risk assessments and public perceptions or to facilitating decisions about nuclear waste or any other major sources of risk conflict. The limited effectiveness of risk communication efforts can be attributed to the lack of trust. (Leiss, 1996)
	•	The importance or risk communication and stakeholder involvement has been fully recognized within the risk assessment process since the early 1990s. That is, it became dear that technical documents would have little benefit if those who would eventually be affected by the outcome did not understand the risk characterization or were felt left out of the decision-making process (NRC,1996). (Williams and Paustenbach, 2002)
	•	In 1989 the US National Rese one of the definitive studies on risk communication, noted that:  "Risk communication is an interactive process of exchange of information and opinion among individuals, groups, and institutions. It involves multiple messages about the nature of risk and other about risk, that express concerns, opinion or reactions to risk messages or to legal and institutional arrangements for risk management (NCR, 1989, p 21).  (Lofstedt, 2008)
	•	[…] in many cases risks are indeed communicated in a top-down fashion. (Lofstedt, 2008)
	•	Fischhoff takes a similar view when he argues: By definition, better risk communication should help its recipients to make better choices. It need not make the communicators' lives easier-recipients discover bona fide disagreements with the communicators and their institutions. What it should do is avoid conflicts due to misunderstanding, increasing the light-to-heat ratio in risk management, leading to fewer but better conflicts. (Fischhoff, 2007, p 31; also Fischhoff, 1995). (Lofstedt, 2008)
	•	Risk communication is never easy particularly with regard to cancer and food related issues (Fischhoff, 1995, 1996, 1999; Kjaernes, 2006). (Lofstedt, 2008)
	•	Some risk communications are content with informing recipients' decisions. Others attempt to influence the direction of those decisions; perhaps to reassure a worried public, perhaps to motivate action. (Atman et al., 1994)
	•	a risk communication should complete a recipient's mental model of the relevant risk processes) which means both adding critical missing information and dispelling misconceptions that might affect decisions. Moreover, its contents should be specific enough to aid decision making: not so general that it cannot address the concrete decisions that recip- ients face, and not so detailed that it obfuscates the mes- sage with needless technical information. (Atman et al., 1994)
	•	A risk communication should cover the basic facts that are relevant to the recipient's decisions. Therefore, the first step in risk communication design is to create (or select) an expert model of the decisions that recipients can make. Discrepancies between this model and recipients' existing mental models then indicate the con- tent of the communications. Thus, the relevance of information depends on the decisions that must be made. (Atman et al., 1994)
	•	risk communication may enhance public knowledge and en- courage informed consent without resulting in changes in behavior. (Golding et al., 1992)
	•	risk communication, which is of major importance throughout the entire risk handling chain. (Renn, 2007a)
	•	Not only should risk communication enable stakeholders and civil society to understand the rationale of the results and decisions from the risk appraisal and risk management phases when they are not formally part of the process, it should also helpthem to make informed choices about risk, balancing factual knowledge about risk with personal interests, concerns, beliefs and resources when they are themselves involved in risk-related decision-making. (Renn, 2007a)
	•	risk communication can have a major impact on how well society is prepared to cope with risk and react to crises and disasters. (Renn, 2007a)
	•	Risk communication has to perform these functions both for the experts involved in the overall risk process – requiring the exchange of information between risk assessors and managers, between scientists and policy- makers, between academic disciplines, and across institutional barriers – and for the ‘outside world’ of those affected by the process. (Renn, 2007a)
	•	The field of risk communication initially developed as a means of investigating how expert assessments could best be communicated to the public so that the tension between public perceptions and expert judgement could be bridged. In the course of time this original objective of educating the public about risks has been modified and even reversed as the professional risk community realized that most members of the public refused to become ‘educated’ by the experts but rather insisted that alternative posi- tions and risk management practices should be selected by the professional community in their attempts to reduce and manage the risks of modern technology (Plough and Krimsky, 1987). (Renn, 2007b)
	•	The objective of this communication effort is to build mutual trust by responding to the concerns of the public and relevant stakeholders. (Renn, 2007b)
	•	The ultimate goal of risk communication is to assist stakeholders in understanding the rationale of risk assessment results and risk management decisions, and to help them arrive at a balanced judgement that reflects the factual evidence about the matter at hand in rela- tion to their own interests and values (OECD, 2002). (Renn, 2007b)
	•	Risk communication is needed throughout the whole risk handling chain, from the framing of the issue to the monitoring of risk management impacts. The precise form of communication needs to reflect the nature of the risks under consideration, their context and whether they arouse, or could arouse, societal concern. (Renn, 2007b)
	•	Communication has to be a means to ensure that: those who are central to risk framing, risk appraisal or risk management understand what is happening, how they are to be involved, and, where appropriate, what their responsibilities are; and others outside the immediate risk appraisal or risk management process are informed and engaged. (Renn, 2007b)
	•	The first task of risk communication – facilitating an exchange of information among risk professionals – has often been underestimated in the literature. A close communication link between risk/concern assessors and risk managers, particularly in the phases of pre-assessment and tolerability/acceptability judgement, is crucial for improving overall governance. (Renn, 2007b)
	•	The second task – that of communicating risk appropriately to the outside world – is also a very challenging endeavour. (Renn, 2007b)
	•	Providing understandable information to help people cope with risks and disasters is, however, only one function of risk communication. (Renn, 2007b)
	•	risk communication needs to address the following topics: explaining the concept of probability and stochastic effects; explaining the difference between risk and hazard;• dealing with stigmatized risk agents or highly dreadful consequences (suchas nuclear waste or cancer); coping with long-term effects; providing an understanding of synergistic effects with other lifestylefactors; addressing the problem of remaining uncertainties and ambiguities; coping with the diversity of stakeholders and parties in the risk appraisaland management phase; and coping with inter-cultural differences within pluralist societies andbetween different nations and cultures. (Renn, 2007b)
	•	Although risk communication implies a stronger role for risk professionals to provide information to the public rather than vice versa, it should be regarded as a mutual learning process in line with the requirements that Leiss postulated for phase III. (Renn, 2007b)
	•	Risk communication requires professional performance both by risk and communi- cation experts. (Renn, 2007b)
	•	The major problem in all risk communication efforts is the distinction between risk and hazard as the paper by Ragnar Lofstedt suggests. (Renn, 2011) 
	•	Risk communication is needed throughout the whole risk handling chain, from the framing of the issue to the monitoring of risk management impacts. The precise form of commu- nication needs to re ect the nature of the hazards and the risks under consideration, their context and whether they excite, or could excite, societal concern. (Renn, 2011)
	•	The ultimate goal of risk communication is to assist stakeholders in understanding the rationale of a risk-based decision, and to help them arrive at a balanced judgment that re ects the factual evidence about the matter at hand in relation to their own in- terests and values (OECD 2002). (Renn, 2011)
	•	Communicating risk appropriately is a very challenging task. (Renn, 2011)
	•	The limited effectiveness of risk-communication efforts can be attributed to the lack of trust. If you trust the risk manager, communication is relatively easy. If trust is lacking, no form or process of commu- nication will be satisfactory. Thus, trust is more fun- damental to conflict resolution than is risk communication. (Slovic, 1993)
	•	Risk communication helps companies, governments and institutions minimize disputes, resolve issues and anticipate problems before they result in an irreversible breakdown in communications. Without good risk communication and good risk management, policy-makers have no road map to guide them through unforeseen problems which frequently derail the best policies and result in a breakdown in communications and a loss of trust among those they are trying hardest to persuade. (Löfstedt, 2005)
	•	Contemporary studies indicated that the most common form of risk communication, ‘top-down’, was not successful in alleviating public fears. The public simply did not seem to be influenced by top-down risk communication programmes. (Löfstedt, 2005)
	•	It is because of its perceived ability to increase public trust that dialogue risk communication is so very much in vogue. (Löfstedt, 2005)
	•	Risk communication experts have emphasized the importance of hostile feelings in some situations. (Sjöberg, 2008)
	•	The Canadian government generally follows the ISO and defines risk communication as “the imparting, receiving, and/or exchanging of clear, credible, and timely information about the existence, nature, form, likelihood, severity, acceptability, treatment, or other aspects of risk to improve decision-making in risk management” (Public Safety Canada, 2012, p. 83). (Newsome, 2013)
	•	The Australian/New Zealand and ISO (International Organization for Standardization, 2009a) standards stressed that communication was less a separate step in a sequential process than a continual activity. The IRGC (2008) stated the same:Communication is of the utmost importance. It enables stakeholders and civil society to understand the risk itself. It also allows them to recognize their role in the risk governance process and, through being deliberately two-way, gives them a voice in it. Once the risk management decision is made, communication should explain the rationale for the decision and allow people to make informed choices about the risk and its management, including their own responsibilities. Effective communication is the key to creating trust in risk management. (p. 15). (Newsome, 2013)
Effective risk communication
	•	Effective risk communication consequently fosters tolerance for conflicting viewpoints, provides the basis for their resolution, and creates trust in the institutional means for assessing and managing risk and related concerns. (Renn, 2007a)
	•	Good practices in risk communication help stakeholders to make informed choices about matters of concern to them and to create mutual trust (Hance et al, 1988; Lundgren, 1994). (Renn, 2007b)
	•	Effective communication, or the non-existence thereof, has a major bear- ing on how well people are prepared to face and cope with risk. Limited knowledge of, and involvement in, the risk management process can lead to inappropriate behaviour in emergency or risk-bearing situations (for example, when facing a pending flood or handling contaminated food or water). (Renn, 2007b)
	•	Effective risk communication can make a strong contribution to the success of a comprehensive and responsible risk management program. (Renn, 2011)
Poor risk communications
	•	Poor risk communications may cause more damage than the risks they are intended to control. They can lead to wrong decisions by omitting key information or failing to contradict misconceptions: They can create confusion by prompting inappropriate assumptions or emphasizing irrelevant information and produce conflict by eroding the audience's faith in the communicator. They can cause recipients to be unduly alarmed or complacent or to undertake ineffective actions. (Bostrom et al., 1994)
	•	Poorly structured or superfluous risk information may bore recipients or frustrate their attempts to under- stand what is really important. (Bostrom et al., 1994)
	•	There is also the risk of failed communication: consumers or product users may misread or misunderstand risk warnings or labels so that they may, through ignorance, expose themselves to a larger risk than necessary. This is particularly prevalent in countries with high rates of illiteracy and unfamiliarity with risk- related terms. (Renn, 2007b)
Risk communicator
	•	Many risk communications are intended to help the lay public make complex decisions about risk. (Atman et al., 1994)
Risk contingency
	•	Many planners are interest in estimating the range of potential contingencies, where a contingency (also a scenario) is some potential event. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Normally, planners are interested in describing each contingency with an actor, action, object, returns, space, and time. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Such contingencies are not necessarily statistically described (they could be quantitively described) but at least imply estimates of potential returns and can be used to calculate risk statistically. (Newsome, 2013)
Return
	•	The returns are experienced by or affect the holders of the risk or those exposed to the risk, such as investors or victims. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	The returns of major risks have multiple dimensions. The most typical categorization is between material and human returns. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Returns can be assessed judgmentally on ordinal scales or measured in economic, organizational, operational, human, environmental, or territorial/geopolitical terms. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Returns can be judged or communicated on ordinal scales. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Returns can be estimate in terms of many objective measures, such as event frequency (accidents or news media mentions), value of losses, inputs (budget, time, or personnel allocated), or product performance (specifications satisfied, capability delivered, customer satisfaction, reliability, usage). (Newsome, 2013)
Economic return
	•	Economic returns include: financial gains and losses, direst economic gains and losses; such as reduced trade; indirect economic gains and losses, such as increased transaction costs due to damaged communications, and; flow changes, such as the flows of goods and services that will not be produced or delivered due to damages to material things such as productive assets and infrastructure. (Newsome, 2013)
Material return
	•	Material returns can be measured by the scale of the items, area, or population affected. (Newsome, 2013)
Organizational return
	•	Organizational returns are often neglected in favour of more material measures, but serious organizational returns include corporate reputation, scale and direction of new media coverage, management effort, personnel turnover, and strategic impact. Some ways could be found to measure these returns in fungible financial terms, but usually the returns are intangible enough to discourage measuring them at all. (Newsome, 2013)
Operational return
	•	The outputs, performance, or effectiveness of projects, programs, activities, strategies, campaigns, missions, and operations are routinely assessed, usually in terms of operational effectiveness, which is another form of return. (Newsome, 2013)
Human return
	•	Human returns are the changes experienced by human beings. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Typically, human returns are measured as deaths, injuries, disability-adjusted life years, economic cost, and changes of situation. (Newsome, 2013)
Environmental return
	•	Natural environmental damage can be assessed in economic terms when agriculture or some other economically productive use of the area is affected. (Newsome, 2013)
Cycle of accelerated returns
	•	cycle of accelerated returns in which the practice becomes easier and more interesting, leading to the ability to practice for longer hours, which increases your skill level, which in turn makes practice even more interesting. (Greene, 2014)
	•	As elements become more automatic your mind is not exhausted by the effort and you can practice harder, which in turn brings greater skill and more pleasure. You can look for challenges, new areas to conquer, keeping your interest at a high level. As the cycle accelerates, you can reach a point where your mind is totally absorbed in the practice, entering a kind of flow in which everything else is blocked out. You become one with the tool or instrument or thing you are studying. (Greene, 2014)

Range of returns
	•	The range of returns is the maximum and minimum returns (or the best and woest returns). Sometimes the difference between them is expressed, too, but the difference is not the same as a the range. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	The range of returns is useful for deceision makers who want to know the best and worst possibile returns before they accept a risk and is useful for planners who must plan for the outcomes. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	The difference (between the maximum and minimum or best and worst outcomes) is often used as an indicator of uncertainty, where a narrower difference is easier for planning. The difference is used as an indicator of exposure, too (in the financial sense, exposure to the range of returns). (Newsome, 2013)
Risk description
	•	A good description of risk helps analysis, recording, shared understanding, and communication. A good qualitative description of a particular risk should include the following: the temporal and geographical scope; the source of the potential event; the potential event; the probability of the potential event, and; the potential event’s returns. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	The Australian/New Zealand and ISO standards (2009, p. 5) define a risk description as “a structured statement of risk containing the following elements: source, events, causes, and consequences.” (Newsome, 2013)
	•	The International Risk Governance Council (2008, p. 7) prescribes analysis of risk by the following dimensions: degree of novelty (emerging, re-emerging, increasing importance, not yet managed); geographical scope; range of impacted domains; time horizon for analysis; time delay between risk and effects; hazard (ubiquitous, persistent, irreversible); and; scientific or technological change (increamental, breakthrough). (Newsome, 2013)
Risk identification
	•	They define risk identification as a “process of finding, recognizing, and describing risks” including “risk sources, events, their causes, and their potential consequences”. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Risk identification is the first stage of risk management. It develops the basis for the next steps: analysis and control of risk management. Correct risk identifiraction ensures risk management effectiveness. If risk managers do not succeed in identifying all possible losses or gains that challenge the organisation, then these non-identified risks will become non-manageable Greene and Trieschmann, 1984). (Tchankova, 2002)
	•	Starting the identification process at this beginning point can form a good basis for its implementation and does not put up any barriers about the types of risk that will be identified or about the resources that are influenced. (Tchankova, 2002)
	•	Risk identification is a process that reveals and determines the possible organisational risks as well as conditions, arising risks. (Tchankova, 2002)
	•	By risk identification the organisation is able to study activities and places where its resources are exposed to risks Williams et al., 1998). (Tchankova, 2002)
	•	Risk identification can be described by the following basic elements: sources of risks; hazard factors; perils; exposures to risk. (Tchankova, 2002)
	•	The frame allows us to consider risk identification a whole, to investigate the risk sources and the reasons that are basic for them, and can increase the possibility for positive or negative outcomes. (Tchankova, 2002)
Risk exposure
	•	Resources exposed to risk are objects facing possible losses or gains. (Tchankova, 2002)
Risk statement
	•	[…] defines a risk statement as “a description of a risk, its likelihood, and its impact on any given environement”. (Newsome, 2013)
Risk objects
	•	'Risk objects' are essentially ideas about harm with implicit causality and may become the focus of `sociotechnical networks' understood as 'seamless webs' of elements and actors engaged in strategies for institutionalizing or de-institutionalizing particular objects of knowledge. (Power, 2009)
	•	dynamics of any particular risk object in organizing definitions and descriptions of a practice and its constituent elements: 'the process of constructing a risk object consists of defining an object and linking it to harm. The task is a rhetorical process performed in texts that are displayed in specialized organizations or in public arenas, and it usually involves building networks of risk objects' (Hilgartner, 1992: 46). (Power, 2009)
	•	Risk objects can be of many different kinds and can change their character as networks of support mutate and create new possibilities for risk description. (Power, 2009)
	•	Such objects may have the technical flavour of a particular analytical community, but equally they may have the status of popular explanatory tropes, or what Jasanoff (2005) calls 'civic epistemologies.' (Power, 2009)
	•	risk objects of different kinds may present problems of observability and monitoring for non-experts. Something close to scientific replication would be required in many cases. So management systems play the role, increasingly important since 1995, of making the process by which these objects are managed auditable and visible (Power, 2009)
	•	"risk object," as Hilgartner calls it (risk objects are technologies or activities to which social agents ascribe the ability to cause harm) (Clarke and Short Jr, 1993)
	•	Risk objects are the things that pose hazards, the sources of danger, the entities to which harmful consequences are conceptually attached. (Hilgartner, 1992)
	•	risk objects exist within dense sociotechnical networks populated by all manner of organizations which must represent and intervene in them: regulatory agencies, security services, banks, research centres, and think tanks—to name a few. (Power, 2009)
	•	Risk objects are attributed putative harm, and associative links are imputed between a particular object and particular harms caused by itisee Hilgartner 1992). The symbolical representation of risk objects in verbal discourse, as well as in nonverbal images and in ritual-like forms of expression, poses challenging research problems for the future (Boholm, 1996)
	•	a risk object is a “physically stabilized, congealed embodiment” (Jasanoff, 1998: 97) of past social assumptions and conventions, rather than a preexist- ing object with essentially harmful characteristics. (Maguire and Hardy, 2013)
	•	In the context of risk, “the process of constructing a risk object” is a “rhetorical process performed in texts” (Hilgartner, 1992: 46). (Maguire and Hardy, 2013)
First-order risk objects
	•	'first-order' risk objects are increasing subsumed within a model of management process, which in turn constructs them as 'auditable' risk objects. (Power, 2009)
Risk producer
	•	Those who find themselves in the public pillory as risk producers refute the charges as well as they can, with the aid of a ‘counter-science’ gradually becoming institutionalized in industry, and attempt to bring in other causes and thus other originators. (Beck, 1992)

Risk of modernization
	•	Risk of modernization. They are a wholesale product of industrialization, and are systemically intensified as it becomes global (Beck, 1992)
	•	Modernization risk appear in geographically specific areas (Beck, 1992)
Risk scares
	•	Risk 'scares' rather than silent incubation have become the norm for risk specialists who have a tendency to amplify danger. (Power, 2009)
Risk-sharing arrangements
	•	Risk-sharing arrangements provide incentives for the production of goods and services within a fundamentally contractarian theory of organization (Power, 2009)
Risk colonization
	•	The logic of risk colonization since 9/11 has fundamentally changed traditional concepts of security. (Coker, 2009)
Risk age 
	•	[…] the risk age itself is only the latest stage of modernity and that history will move on sooner or later. (Coker, 2009) 
	•	the risk age did not suddenly come upon us: it has a history like everything else and first we need to study it. (Coker, 2009)
	•	The risk age did not emerge in a void. It had a long gestation period. It was not something that was either previously unthought or even unthinkable. (Coker, 2009)
	•	The risk age did not come into being overnight; it was foregrounded in the age that preceded it, especially in the growing recognition that the world was becoming so incredibly complex that everything had conse- quences, many of which could not be foreseen, which is why we now inter- rogate ourselves more intensely than ever. We have become irredeemably self-reflexive and as a result increasingly risk-averse. (Coker, 2009)
	•	Ours is an age of risk, and insecurity is its definitive feature. (Coker, 2009)
	•	If Sainte-Beuve is right that every age has its own special malady then anxiety may well be branded the malady of our own. (Coker, 2009)
	•	The risk age has given rise to its own unique consciousness. (Coker, 2009)
	•	Concern about risk is no longer a peripheral matter: it is built into the environment, into our culture and especially the everyday routines that guide our lives. In this sense, we can indeed be said to be living in a ‘risk age’ because we have become aware somewhat late in the day of the complexity that inheres in life. (Coker, 2009)
	•	The risk age represents just such a change of consciousness. We now recognize that we consume more history than we produce. (Coker, 2009)
	•	The risk age encourages us to ‘securitize’ everything, but we often do so in the absence of reliable information. (Coker, 2009)
	•	The risk age encourages us to criminalize more and more groups all the time and at the same time to ascribe blame. (Coker, 2009)
	•	The risk age is definable in terms of the limits of human knowledge not these days of the mind of God, but of the observable and quantifiable world around us. (Coker, 2009)
	•	In the risk age, uncertainties about the future tend to proliferate and intensify our preoccupation with ‘aftermaths’. (Coker, 2009)
	•	Our age, by contrast, is increasingly non-linear in the sense that we recognize that the future is as unpredictable as forecasting the weather. (Coker, 2009)
	•	The risk age may be conceivable as the com- pression of time, and history may have become the story of acceleration, but we must recognize that speed takes no account of complexity. (Coker, 2009)
	•	In an age of risk we are obliged to recognize that the way war is conducted conveys a ‘meaning’ that is no less important than war itself. (Coker, 2009)
	•	In a risk age, we are always enjoined to anticipate the negative effects of our decisions; we are urged all the time to bring the future into a calcula- tive relation to the present. (Coker, 2009)
	•	in an age of risk victory is no longer possible: all that can be pursued is the more effective management of the global disorder that obtains. Success now means reducing insecurity to more acceptable levels. (Coker, 2009)
	•	The risk age has thrown up a new set of ethical dilemmas which we are ill-placed to address, let alone resolve. (Coker, 2009)
	•	The risk age, in short, asks us to address a new security paradigm. (Coker, 2009)
	•	the risk age requires knowledge of the people it seeks to control (Norris 1999:24). (Coker, 2009)
	•	The risk age is not one in which values or value-inspired strategies are rejected altogether. But interests count for much more than they did. (Coker, 2009)
	•	Our age, by comparison, manages problems that do not lend themselves to solutions. (Coker, 2009)
	•	In the risk age, coalitions will always be ambushed by unforeseen events (stuff happens, and always will). (Coker, 2009)
	•	the risk age demands our view of the world must be open-ended so that many stories can be told, not one (Taylor 2007:566). (Coker, 2009)
	•	In the risk age, by contrast, life is too complex to be reordered, and even if this were not the case, war is too imperfect an instrument to do the reordering. (Coker, 2009)
	•	Our age is so much more complex that we have to acknowledge that there are limits to human actions − this understanding is a feature of the times. (Coker, 2009)
	•	The latent, of course, is a feature of the risk age, the delayed symptoms that alert us to the fact that we can fall ill long after we have contracted a disease; that even the effects of ‘effects-based operations’ do not always become clear until it is too late. (Coker, 2009)
	•	In the risk age inter-state conflicts are so few probably because they are so costly. (Coker, 2009)
Risk society
	•	‘risk society’, having lost innocence about causes of misfortune, focuses with a new political intensity on the distribution of risks (Douglas, 2005:45)
	•	[…]‘risk society’ thesis; the risks we face today are largely ‘manufactured’, potentially fatal by-products of an industrial machine which demands a new politics to control it. (Hutter and Power, 2005)
	•	Risk society consists of two central interrelated theses. One concerns reflexive modernization and the other the issue of risk (Lash and Wynne, 1992)
	•	Risk society is the distribution of ‘bads’ or dangers (Lash and Wynne, 1992)
	•	while classical industrial society the ‘logic’ of wealth production dominates the ‘logic’ of risk production, in the risk society this relationship is reversed (Lash and Wynne, 1992)
	•	In the risk society, the past loses the power to determine the present (Beck, 1992)
	•	Risk societies are not exactly class societies (Beck, 1992)
	•	The risk society shifts from hysteria to indifference and vice versa (Beck, 1992)
	•	The risk society is in this sense also the science, media and information society. Thus new antagonism open up between those who produce risk definitions and those who consume them
	•	The risk society is in this sense also the science, media and information society. Thus new antagonism open up between those who produce risk definitions and those who consume them (Beck, 1992)
	•	Risk society produces new antagonisms of interest and a new type of community of the endangered whose political carrying capacity remains, however, an open question (Beck, 1992)
	•	Risk society controls new sources of conflict and consensus (Beck, 1992)
	•	Risk societies bring about ‘communities of danger’ (Beck, 1992)
	•	Value system of ‘unsafe society’ (Beck, 1992)
	•	the utopia of risk remains peculiarly negative and defensive […] preventing the worst; self-limitation is the goal which emerges. (Beck, 1992)
	•	The utopia of the risk society is that everyone should be spared from poisoning. (Beck, 1992)
	•	In the risk society, the unknown and unintended consequences come to be a dominant force in history and society (Beck, 1992)
	•	Risk society in this sense is a world risk society (Beck, 1992)
	•	With the economic exploitation of the risks it sets free, industrial society produces the hazards and the political potential of the risk society (Beck, 1992)
	•	Risk society is a catastrophic society. In it the exceptional condition threatens to become the norm (Beck, 1992)
	•	the 'risk society' idea lies in its capacity to name nascent anxieties. Beck's ideas appeal in contexts where there is increasing conscious- ness of self-produced risks and also doubts about the capacity of a flourishing risk regulation industry to cope with them. (Power, 2009)
	•	The `risk society' idea also suggests a growing degree of institutional mistrust—the `end of tradition' in Beck's terms—and the reception of his central concept has generated interest in risk aversity at the societal level. (Power, 2009)
	•	the idea of the risk society can be reposed as a society where there is a systemic tendency to construct, describe, and stabilize an increasing number of harm-based risk objects. (Power, 2009)
	•	’risk society’, we are also said to live in a ‘regulatory state’ (Hood et al., 2001)
	•	‘risk society’ and ‘regulatory state’ are mainly concerned, substantial variation can be observed in the particular risks and hazards that are chosen for regulation and the way regulation works (Hood et al., 2001)
	•	risk has a different significance for everyday life from that applying in previous historical eras. Human activity and technology in ‘advanced modernity’, he claims, produces as a side‐effect risks that need specialized expertise to assess and recognize, are collective, global, and irreversible in their impact, and thus potentially catastrophic on a scale never seen before (Hood et al., 2001)
	•	risk societies are capable of understanding themselves as constitutes through risk dynamics’, and hence of negotiating how best to meet material and political consequences that arise from ‘everyday risk management’ as well as catastrophic risk (Buzan and Hansen, 2011)
	•	In risk society, she argues, hazards are given an arithmetic value, based on probabilities, and the state is regarded as responsible for managing these risks, placing citizens in the position of passive victims (Skinns et al., 2011) 
	•	‘risk society’ in which individuals are ever more conscious of self-produced or manufactured risk (Power, 2004)
	•	A functional explanation for the phenomenon suggests that the emergence of a systematic, generic and broad approach to risk management is a rational response to the fact that the environment of individuals and organisations, indeed the world, has become genuinely ‘more risky’ (Power, 2004)
	•	In risk society scientists and experts create as many uncertainties as they dispel, and that risk priorities are perceptual, distributional, and political matters that must be negotiated through exchanges of views, rather than laid down from on high by experts making hidden value judgment (Baldwin et al., 2013)
	•	The risk society is, therefore, necessarily a regulatory society (Rothstein et al., 2006)
	•	Ulrich Beck’s Risikogesellschaft is an ambitious and original attempt to rewrite the whole of political science and economics in terms of risk. His idea is that this shift of focus is inevitable, that our modern industrial society has undergone changes which result in the old moral questions about the allocation of wealth being transformed into new moral questions about the allocation of risks (Douglas, 2005)
	•	‘risk society’, having lost innocence about causes of misfortune, focuses with a new political intensity on the distribution of risks (Douglas, 2005)
	•	A risk society is a society where we increasingly live on a high technological frontier which absolutely no one completely understands and which generates a diversity of possible futures. (Giddens, 1999)
	•	A risk society is not intrinsically more dangerous or hazardous than pre-existing forms of social order. It is instructive in this context to trace out the origins of the term ‘risk’. (Giddens, 1999)
	•	The idea of ‘risk society’ might suggest a world which has become more hazardous, but this is not necessarily so. Rather, it is a society increasingly preoccupied with the future (and also with safety), which generates the notion of risk. (Giddens, 1999)
	•	Risk society is industrial society which has come up against its own limitations, where those limitations take the form of manufactured risk. Modernisation in this sense, cannot simply be ‘more of the same’. (Giddens, 1999)
	•	a transition has occurred from a modern industrialized society constituted by social classes, to a new form of society in which class soli- darity has lost much of its former significance. In this new era of highly individualized 'reflexive modernity', the main social issue is not the distribu- tion of wealth between social classes but, rather, the distribution, among indi- viduals, of hazards and dangers produced by society. (Boholm, 1996)
	•	in this new, post-modern, 'risk society', everyone is actively engaged in the production of political and moral discourse on technological dangers and threats, brought about by man, to the environment and the human body. (Boholm, 1996)
	•	the debates produced by 'risk society' itself, to return to the idea of Ulrich Beck with which I began this article, do not primarily concern abstract notions about 'adverse' events. (Boholm, 1996)
	•	By that Beck means that risk has a different significance for everyday life from that applying in previous historical eras. Human activity and technology in ‘advanced modernity’, he claims, produces as a side-effect risks that need specialized expertize to assess and recognize, are collective, global, and irreversible in their impact, and thus potentially catastrophic on a scale never seen before. (Hood et al., 2001)
	•	Beck and associated thinkers would add other cases that they see as typical of ‘advanced modernity’, like the risks associated with genetically midwifed organisms, reproductive technology, or computer failures that also potentially impact on a wide range of everyday human life. (Hood et al., 2001)
	•	The two ideas of ‘risk society’ and ‘regulatory state’ could, indeed, be linked in so ar as risk and safety is often held to be one of the major drivers of contemporary regulatory growth. (Hood et al., 2001)
	•	[…] into risk societies that show increased sensitivity to risk in general, though they neglect or activate certain hazards, such as environmental hazards, due to misplaced attention to some risks over others (Beck, 1995; Beck, Ritter & Lash, 1992; Wisner, Blaikie, Cannon, & Davis, 2004, pp. 16-18). (Newsome, 2013)
	•	In many societies, risks are high by foreign standards but are regarded locally as routine or unavoidable for practical as well as cultural reasons. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	As societies develop, they accrue more material affluence and security and forms of credibility that discourage recklessness. They may develop a “postmodern” “risk society” that is hupersensitive to social risks, such as potential crime, and to economic risks, such as potential interruptions in the supply of manufactured goods, but hyposensitive to other risks, such as potential environmental damage from increased industrial manufacture (Beck, 1992, 1995). (Newsome, 2013)
	•	A number of sociologists – Anthony Giddens, Ulrich Beck, John Adams and Niklas Luhmann foremost among them – use the term ‘risk society’ to describe how the citizens of Western countries have come to see their society’s development as ‘a theme and a problem for itself’. (Rasmussen, 2006)
	•	Focusing on strategy as a part of social development allows one to look at ‘strategies’ other than military strategy. This is important because the creation of a risk society has led to a proliferation of strategic practices. (Rasmussen, 2006)
	•	In the risk society experts thus no longer hold the privileged position of being the only ones who know how the system works. Moreover, in the absence of a clearly defined set of ‘knowns’, not only do the statements of experts become increasing politicised, but their monopoly on knowledge becomes open to challenge by grass-root experts with agendas of their own (this is very clear in the environmental debate). (Rasmussen, 2004)
	•	‘Risk society’ is one way to explain what is missing in the debate between soft and hard security. The point is not how to apply the concept of security, but that the concept of security itself is changing. (Rasmussen, 2004)
	•	The focus on risk society turns the ‘broad conception of security’ inside out. (Rasmussen, 2004)
	•	The concept of risk society describes, as Ulrich Beck puts it,a phase of development of modern society in which the social, political, ecological and individual risks created by the momentum of innovation increasingly elude the control and protective institutions of industrial society. (Griner, 2002)
	•	Risk society demands democratic decision-making in states but also in private corporations. (Griner, 2002)
	•	risk society is actually a world risk society. It presupposes a dynamic of global and local—‘glocal’—questions, which does not fit into national politics. (Griner, 2002)
	•	According to Beck, risk society produces a new type of community whose political capacity remains an open question: there is not a political institution for the expression of a world citizenship. (Griner, 2002)
	•	A growing body of sociological work concludes that means-ends rationality is being displaced by a reflexive rationality. (Rasmussen, 2001)
	•	As a scenario, risk society describes the transformation process, as well as the probable result of this transformation: the construction of a new type of society, which may or may not survive this ‘late-modern’ epoch. The risk scenario shows the creation of a new social rationality, which, according to Beck, calls for a new sociological theory. (Rasmussen, 2001)
	•	Risk society is open to ‘rule-altering’ politics because of risk’s ‘origin in decision-making’. In a risk society you choose the risks you take, rather than eliminate risks altogether. (Rasmussen, 2001)
	•	To be a risk society hoewer, is no just to ask oneself more questions or to be even more troubled by doubt. A risk society has to accept ambivalence as a condition of itw own existence. Insecurity, not security, is now the norm, but at levels that we may find more acceptable. The future cannot be secured but it can be made ‘safer’. (Coker, 2009)
	•	The problem is that the citizen would seem to be at greater risk than ever. Such is the risk society and the culture of fear to which it gives rise. It encourages all of us to be apocalyptic about the future, nostalgic about a supposedly more secure past and misinformed about how insecure the present really is. (Coker, 2009)
	•	A risk society is necessarily a safety society, one that is permanently on the defensive. (Coker, 2009)
	•	In so far as risk management depends on knowledge of the risks that are ‘out there’, knowledge in turn can generate even more risks which must be addressed, managed, regulated and controlled. (Coker, 2009)
	•	The risk age did not come into being overnight; it was foregrounded in the age that preceded it, especially in the growing recognition that the world was becoming so incredibly complex that everything had conse- quences, many of which could not be foreseen, which is why we now interrogate ourselves more intensely than ever. We have become irredeemably self-reflexive and as a result increasingly risk-averse. (Coker, 2009)
	•	what we are securing ourselves against is a kaleidoscope of risks, defined or ill-defined, real or imaginary, external or inter- nalized, all of which make us more anxious than ever. (Coker, 2009)
	•	We find ourselves living in risk societies, a term popularized by, among others, the German sociologist Ulrich Beck. (Coker, 2009)
	•	Beck’s main thesis is that we have witnessed a radical change in social pol- itics and cultural experience which defines a new stage of modernity. The risk society perspective is a heuristic device which allows us to observe and probe the peculiarities of our world, and to ask why it is pervaded by an extraordinary degree of anxiety about the future.We are anxious in part because the idea of ‘risk’ has none of its earlier positive connotations. (Coker, 2009)
	•	In identifying all three types of risk Beck insisted on distinguishing them from the other dangers societies had had to face in the past. (Coker, 2009)
	•	For today risk has changed everything, especially the way we conceive security. (Coker, 2009)
	•	The risk society was born from the environmental movement in the 1970s, when for the first time states publicly admitted that there were hazards in the use of any technology, however beneficial. (Coker, 2009)
	•	our risk societies deal with probabilities, not certainties. (Coker, 2009)
International risk society
	•	An international risk society can be said to exist to the extent that international agents act according to a reflexive rationality. (Rasmussen, 2001)
Risk reduction
	•	Risk reduction is typically the driving force for security departments whose role it is to provide protection for assets. (Vellani, 2007)
Regulatory society
	•	the regulatory society is a risk (generating) society (Rothstein et al., 2006)
Risk society theorists
	•	Risk society theorists are interested in problems such as these that emerge as unexpected effects of previous attempts to control the world, (Giddens 1991, Beck 1992) (Roberts, 2001a)
Risk tool
	•	risk tools are attractive, at least in principle, because they offer decision makers a means for limiting potential blame by reframing adverse governance outcomes in more differentiated terms of acceptable and unacceptable risk (Rothstein and alt., 2013:218)
Risk mitigation
	•	Given a specific threat, many specific risk mitigation strategies are available to the security decision maker. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	A thorough risk assessment allows security decision makers to prioritize risk reduction activities and adapt to changing and emerging threats. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	Risk mitigation is a security strategy that is accomplished by decreasing the threat level by eliminating or intercepting adversaries before they attack, blocking opportunities through enhanced security, or reducing the consequences if an attack should occur. (Vellani, 2007)
Risk tradeoffs
	•	Risk tradeoffs are essentially a case of a broader phenomenon of actions that bring about unanticipated or undesirable side effects. (Rascoff and Revesz, 2002)
	•	The so-called risk-risk trade-off occurs when a regulator focuses on decreasing one specific risk (e.g., chlorinating drinking water to make it safer) and unintentionally increases a risk elsewhere (e.g., human cancers caused by substances being generated during the chlorination). (Lofstedt, 2011)
	•	regulation itself has costs and potential risks. For instance, introduction of genetic- ally modified crops may harm ecosystems, but harm may also occur (from increased hunger or more widespread pesticide use) if genetically modified crops are prohibited. (Sachs, 2011)
	•	the so-called “risk- risk” trade-off, i.e. limiting the use of one substance because of real or perceived dangers will inevitably lead to increased use of another substance (with its own hazard and risk pro le) or a change in the resulting product or process that can also raise safety issues. (Nordlander, 2011)
	•	The so-called risk/risk trade-off occurs, when a policy-maker or regulator focuses on decreasing one specific risk (chlorinating drinking water to make it safer) but unintentionally increases a risk elsewhere (possible, although not proven, human cancers caused by the chlorination) (Graham and Wiener 1995). (Lofstedt, 2014)
	•	These risk/risk trade-offs are found everywhere and even with the vast scientific improvements made over the past decades are rather common place, but are arguably denied for the sake of political expediency. (Lofstedt, 2014)
	•	risk/risk trade-offs are direct products of incomplete, and in many cases, unscientific decision-making. (Lofstedt, 2014)
	•	one hazard is replaced by an equally serious, or worse hazard, resulting in unintended socio-economic costs. (Olofsson, 2014)
Risk tradeoff analysis

	•	Risk tradeoff analysis is in the process of transforming the practice of regulation. Its core
idea is simple and intuitively appealing: Regulations undertaken to minimize or eliminate certain health risks often have the perverse effect of promoting other. (Rascoff and Revesz, 2002)
	•	risk tradeoff analysis promises a more rational technique for the evaluation of regulation. (Rascoff and Revesz, 2002)
	•	Risk tradeoff analysis, however, focuses exclusively on the negative secondary effects of risk regulation, but systematically ignores the phenomenon of "ancillary benefits, " the reductions in risk that take place in addition to -and as a direct or indirect result of- reductions in the target risk. (Rascoff and Revesz, 2002)
	•	[…] risk tradeoff analysis is applied in the administrative state. Agency inattention to ancillary effects gives rise to iterative processes of administrative oversight and judicial review that privilege the opponents of regulation. (Rascoff and Revesz, 2002)
	•	risk tradeoff analysis enjoys ever-growing support in the courts and the academy, this Article proposes an approach through which to counteract its one-sidedness. (Rascoff and Revesz, 2002)
	•	At the core of risk tradeoff analysis lies an important methodological flaw: inattention to ancillary benefits. (Rascoff and Revesz, 2002)
	•	Risk tradeoff analysis focuses on and attempts to quantify only the negative -that is to say, the risk-promoting-secondary effects of risk regulation. (Rascoff and Revesz, 2002)
	•	risk tradeoff analysis systematically ignores the phenomenon of "ancillary benefits," reductions in risk that take place in addition to -and as a direct or indirect result of -reductions in the target risk. (Rascoff and Revesz, 2002)
	•	Risk tradeoff analysis depends on being able to accurately charac- terize risk and monetize the expected value of all projected harms (Sachs, 2011)

Operational risk
	•	[…] ‘operational risk' (Chapter 4). Thus, financial scandals, such as Barings. Daiwa, and Sumitomo, have come to be understood as management and governance failures rather than failures of analysis and information (Tschoegl, 2000; Hogan, 1997). (Power, 2009)
	•	le risque opérationnel et le risque légal, sont moins importants pour ce travail, car ceux-ci ne sont pas couverts à l’aide de produits financiers. (Dumont, 2011)
Juridical risk
	•	le risque opérationnel et le risque légal, sont moins importants pour ce travail, car ceux-ci ne sont pas couverts à l’aide de produits financiers. (Dumont, 2011)
Modern risk management
	•	Modern risk management also emerged from new institutions for the collection and statistical analysis of data, such as the census. (Power, 2009)
	•	Modern managerial ideals of 'governing by numbers' (Power, 2009)
Informed awareness of the risk
	•	Informed awareness of the risk helps to lower sensitivity, even when the risk turns out to be worse than feared! (Newsome, 2013)
Public perceptions of risk
	•	Public perceptions of risk are not simply a new factor in more intelligent risk analysis, they are a source of risk in themselves (Power, 2009)
	•	Public perceptions, however, are the product of intuitive biases and economic interests and reflect cultural values more generally. (Kasperson et al., 1988)
	•	social context and culture shape perceptions and cognition. (Kasperson et al., 1988)
	•	The main thesis of this article is that risk events interact with psychological, social, and cultural processes in ways that can heighten or attenuate public perceptions of risk and related risk behavior. Behavioral patterns, in turn, generate secondary social or economic consequences but may act also to increase or decrease the physical risk itself. Secondary effects trigger demands for additional institutional responses and protective actions, or, conversely (in the case of risk attenuation), impede needed protective actions. (Kasperson et al., 1988)
	•	The social structures and processes of risk experience, the resulting repercussions on individual and group perceptions, and the effects of these responses on community, society, and economy compose a general phenomenon that we term the social amplification of risk. (Kasperson et al., 1988)
	•	It is now evident that public perceptions and ac- ceptance of risk from nuclear and chemical technologies are not much influenced by technical risk assessments. (Slovic, 1993)
Technical risk specialists
	•	Technical risk specialists have created new roles, tasks, and occupational associations around the project of managing risk. (Power, 2009)

Determinations of risks
	•	Determinations of risks are the form in which ethics, and with it also philosophy, culture and politics, is resurrected inside the centres of modernization – in business, the natural sciences and the technical disciplines (Beck, 1992)

Dread risk
	•	dread risk," was associated with: lack of control over the activity; fatal consequences if there were a mishap of some sort; high catastrophic potential; reactions of dread; inequitable distribution of risks and benefits (including the transfer of risks to future generations), and the belief that risks are increasing and not easily reducible. (Perrow, 1999)
	•	High on this "dread risk" factor were nuclear weapons, nuclear power, warfare, nerve gas, terrorism, crime, and "national defense." Note that nuclear weapons, nuclear power, and military activities in general are systems we classified as complex and tightly coupled (Perrow, 1999)
	•	"dread risk," is defined at its high (right-hand) end by perceived lack of control, dread, catastrophic potential, fatal consequences, and the inequitable distribution of risks and benefits. (Slovic, 1987) 
	•	Most important is the horizontal factor "dread risk."
The higher a hazard's score on this factor (the further to the right it
appears in the space), the higher its perceived risk, the more people
want to see its current risks reduced, and the more they want to see strict regulation employed to achieve the desired reduction in risk. (Slovic, 1987)
	•	defined at the high end by perceived lack of individual control. (Lerner and Keltner, 2000)
	•	dread, defined by the extent of perceived lack of control, feelings of dread, and perceived catastrophic potential, and risk of the unknown, the extent to which the hazard is judged to be unobservable. (Loewenstein et al., 2001)
Risk thinning 
	•	Thinning the risk is a strategy known usually as diversification. It is a unique strategy that does not terminate, turn, take, transfer, or treat any particular risk but nevertheless reduces our total risk by spreading or thinning our loss exposure across more diverse types of risks, sites, partners, providers, etc. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	thinning or diversifying the risks often reduces the chance of the best outcome at the same time as it reduces the chance of the worst outcome. (Newsome, 2013)
Risk efficiency
	•	Risk efficiency: “Successful risk management is not just about reducing threats to project performance. A key motive is the identification of opportunities to change base plans and develop contingency plans in the context of a search for risk efficiency, takingan aggressive approach to the level of risk that is appropriate, with a view to long-term corporate performance maximization” (Chapman & Ward, 2002, p. 54). (Newsome, 2013)
Unknown risk
	•	“unknown risk," included risks that are unknown, unobservable, new, and delayed in their manifestation. (Perrow, 1999)
	•	"unknown risk," is defined at its high end by hazards judged to be unobservable, unknown, new, and delayed in their manifestation of harm. (Slovic, 1987) 
	•	defined at the high end by hazards judged to be uncertain. (Lerner and Keltner, 2000)
	•	Unknown unknowns are best identified as those factors, forces, or players that one did not realize were important or influential before commencing the scenarios analysis exercise. (Pherson, 2009)
Positive risk
	•	defining a positive risk as an opportunity is unnecessary because the term positive risk needs no synonym. (Newsome, 2013)
Negative risk
	•	Hazards and threats are the sources of negative risks. (Newsome, 2013)
External risk
	•	External risks: “Some risks arise from events outside the company and are beyond its influence or control. Sources of these risks include natural and political disasters and major macroeconomic shifts.” (Newsome, 2013)
	•	The World Economic Forum (2013, pp. 9, 36) endorsed external risks as “global risks” and characterized “most” of the global risks in its reports as “difficult to predict” with “little knowledge on how to handle such risks.” (Newsome, 2013)
Strategy risk
	•	Strategy risks: “Strategy risks are quite different from preventable risks because they are not inherently undesirable. A strategy with highexpected returns generally requires the company to take on significant risks, and managing those risks is a key driver in capturing the potential gains.” (Newsome, 2013)
Risk elimination
	•	Risk elimination is both cost-prohibitive and impossible. (Freier, 2009)
Risk record
	•	Risk records can be used to communicate the risks to other stakeholders, but they tend to be restricted to thefew stakeholders who need or can be trusted with all the information. (Newsome, 2013)
Risk transfer
	•	Risk transfer is a strategy used to remove the risk from the owner to a third party. (Vellani, 2007)
Pure risk
	•	Pure risks are always negative (they offer no benefits) and often unavoidable, such as natural risks and terrorism. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	[…] the dominant responses to pure risks are to avoid them or to insure against them. (Newsome, 2013)

Risk proximity
	•	People will feel more sensitive to a risk that is more proximate in time or space (say, when they are travelling through a stormu area) than when they are remote to the risk (say, when the last storm recedes into the past). This proximity is correlated with anchoring. (Newsome, 2013)
Speculative risk
	•	Speculative risks include both positive and negative risks and are voluntary or avoidable, such as financial investments. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Speculative risks should be either pursued if positive or avoided if negative. (Newsome, 2013)

Standard risk
	•	Standard risks are risks against which insurers offer insurance at standard rates, albeit sometimes parsed by consumers. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Most standard risks derive from predicatble causes, such as unhealthy behaviors, or frequent events, such as road traffic accidents, that give the insurer condifence in their assessments of the risks. (Newsome, 2013)

Nonstandards risks
	•	Nonstandard risks tend to be risks with great uncertainty or great potential for negative returns, like those associated with war, terrorism, and natural catastrophes (although a few insurers specialize in these risks). (Newsome, 2013)
	•	To insure against a nonstandard risk, the consumer could negotiate a particual policy but might fail to find any insurer, in which case the consumer is left to retain or avoid the risk. (Newsome, 2013)
Positive risk
	•	Potential contributors that could be activated as some sort of positive partner, defender, or ally. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	
Risk efficiency
	•	[…] the two criteria for risk efficiency are simple enough: the expected return should be preferable (either a smaller negative return or a larger positive return); and the range of returns should be narrower (sometimes we settle for a smaller maximum negative return or a larger minimum positive return). (Newsome, 2013)
Risk perception
	•	Studies of risk perception examine the judgments people make when they are asked to characterize and evaluate
hazardous activities and technologies. This research aims
to aid risk analysis and policy-making by (i) providing a
basis for understanding and anticipating public responses
to hazards and (ii) improving the communication of risk
information among lay people, technical experts, and decision-makers. (Slovic, 1987)
	•	Results from studies of the perception of risk have been used to explain and forecast acceptance and opposition for specific technologies (Slovic, 1987)
	•	A consequence of the public's concerns and its opposition to risky technologies has been an increase in attempts to inform and educate people about risk. Risk perception research has a number of implications for such educational efforts (Slovic, 1987)
	•	Studies of risk perception have revealed clearly, however, that most persons have a much more comprehensive conception of risk. (Kasperson et al., 1988)
	•	Cognitive psychologists and decision researchers have investigated the underlying patterns of individual perception of risk and identified a series of heuristics and biases that govern risk perception. (Kasperson et al., 1988)
	•	risk perception researchers have investigated in depth how judgments about perceived risks and their acceptability arise, and how such judgments are related to risk "heuristics" (e.g. the memorability, representativeness, and affective qualities of risk events) and the qualitative characteristics of risk (e.g. voluntariness or catastrophic potential). (Pidgeon et al., 2003)
	•	[…] for different institutional settings, each generates its own characteristic view of the world, variously referred to as a cosmology or cultural bias. (Rayner and Cantor, 1987)
	•	If Holdren is correct, perception of danger should accord with what individuals know about the risk in question. (Wildavsky and Dake, 1990)
	•	Perception of danger is selective; it varies with the object of attention. (Wildavsky and Dake, 1990)
	•	the most powerful factor for predicting risk perceptions is trust in institutions or ideology, which is largely about which institutions can be trusted. (Wildavsky and Dake, 1990)
	•	How people view risks and apply value judgements is perhaps the most challenging factor to take into account when developing an approach to the regulation of risk – not least because these views and value judgements are not static but change according to circumstances. (Great Britain and Health and Safety Executive, 2001)
	•	representatives of civil society as well as the general public are responding to risks according to their own risk constructs and images. These images are called ‘perceptions’ in the psychological and social sciences and they have been intensely researched in relation to risk – as have their underlying factors (Covello, 1983; Slovic, 1987; Boholm, 1998; Rohrmann and Renn, 2000). (Renn, 2007b)
	•	Risk perceptions belong to the contextual aspects that risk managers need to consider when deciding whether or not a risk should be taken as well as when designing risk reduction measures. (Renn, 2007b)
	•	Most cognitive psychologists believe that perceptions are formed by common-sense reasoning, personal experience, social communication and cultural traditions (Brehmer, 1987; Drottz-Sjöberg, 1991; Pidgeon et al, 1992; Pidgeon, 1998). In relation to risk it has been shown that humans link certain expectations, ideas, hopes, fears and emotions with activ- ities or events that have uncertain consequences. People do not, however, use completely irrational strategies to assess information: most of the time they follow relatively consistent patterns of creating images of risks and evaluating them. These patterns are related to certain evolutionary bases of coping with dangerous situations. (Renn, 2007b)
	•	The problems associated with risk perception are compounded because of the difficulty individuals have in interpreting low probabilities when making their decisions (Kunreuther et al, 2001). (Renn, 2007b)
	•	many of the public’s reactions to risk could be attributed to a sensitivity to technical, social, and psychological qualities of hazards that were not well-modeled in tech- nicalriskassessments(e.g., qualitiessuchasuncertainty in risk assessments, perceived inequity in the distribution of risks and benefits, and aversion to being exposed to risks that were involuntary, not under one’s control, or dreaded). The important role of socia1 values in risk perception and risk acceptance thus became apparent. (Slovic, 1993)
	•	The relationship between trust and risk perception has since gained widespread attention (e.g., Renn & Levine, 1991; Pidgeon et al., 1992; Slovic, 1993). Fur- thermore, trust is seen as one prerequisite for effec- tive risk communication (e.g., Kasperson et al., 1992), while distrust may be associated with stigmatization of technologies, such as nuclear power (Flynn et al., 2001) as well as social amplification effects following major failures of risk regulation (see Freudenburg, 2003; Kasperson et al., 2003). (Poortinga and Pidgeon, 2003)
	•	some research suggests that risk perceptions are related to individuals’ levels of decision power (for example, whether they have high or low ability to influence decisions about the use of hazards such as liquefied petroleum gas) and their interest in a hazard (for example, direct, indirect, or adversarial) (see, for example, Kuyper and Vlek, 1984; Baird, 1986; Bord and O’Connor, 1997). (Finucane et al., 2000)
	•	When risk perception first became a topic in behavioral research, it was believed by many that the ‘‘biased’’ views held by the public on risks of technology were due to cognitive limitations. (Sjöberg, 2006)
	•	perceptions of risk are related to sociopolitical factors such as worldviews, as very low perceptions of risk were associated with individualist and hierarchist worldviews and very high perceptions of risk were associated with an egalitarian worldview. (Palmer, 2003) 
	•	Risk perception also varies according to the target considered: people tend to view the risk for themselves or their relatives (personal anxiety) as being lower than for peo-ple in general (social anxiety). (Figuié and Fournier, 2008)
	•	risk perception determines the politics of risk in a world risk society. (Griner, 2002)
	•	Perceptions of risk, in other words, tend to reinforce existing social divisions. (Coker, 2009)
	•	Risk perception is not stable and it may change during a political process or as a result of scientific discourses. (Brauch, 2011)
	•	Risk perception is a process. (Brauch, 2011)
	•	No matter how clear and logical a presentation, effective communication requires a recipient as well as a source—in medicine, law, environment or intelligence. Psychologists have identified a number of mechanisms by which people are known to systematically misconstrue quantitative measures of uncertainty, whether frequentist or Bayesian, when these are presented to them. While these mechanisms, or heuristics, are often efficient cognitive tools for decisionmaking, they can create biases when inappropriately applied. These factors may derive from the individual mentality and circumstances of the recipient of the information, or may depend on the characteristics of the situation being discussed, or both. (Weiss, 2008)

Perceived risk
	•	how people understood the likelihood of such adverse events (Boholm, 1996)
	•	Perceived risk is a central variable in much of the discussion of risk management and risk communication (Slovic, 1987, 2000; Renn, 2004). (Sjöberg, 2008)
Patterns of risk perception
	•	Patterns of risk perception have also been found to relate to both group and cultural affiliations. (Pidgeon et al., 2003)
Risk-related patterns
	•	risk-related patterns, which are based on the properties of the source of risk (Renn, 2007b) (Renn, 2007b)
Situation-related patterns
	•	situation-related patterns, based on the idiosyncrasies of the risky situa- tion (Fischhoff et al, 1978; Slovic, 1987; Slovic, 1992). (Renn, 2007b)
Private risk management activities
	•	Private risk management activities are intrinsically less publicly obvious than other risk management strategies. Two of the more visible forms of this strategy are industrial self-regulation and licensure and certification. (Covello and Mumpower, 1986)
Risky project
	•	[…] people often (but not always) take on risky projects because they are overly optimistic about the odds they face. I will return to this idea several times in this book—it probably contributes to an explanation of why people litigate, why they start wars, and why they open small businesses. (Kahneman, 2012)
Risk averse
	•	a risk-averse decision maker will choose a sure thing that is less than expected value, in effect paying a premium to avoid the uncertainty. One hundred years before Fechner, Bernoulli invented psychophysics to explain this aversion to risk. His idea was straightforward: people’s choices are based not on dollar values but on the psychological values of outcomes, their utilities (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	The role of loss aversion in bargaining is also well understood: making concessions hurts. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	Risk taking and risk aversion are not all ofa piece, but depend on how people feel about the object of attention. (Wildavsky and Dake, 1990)
	•	Risk aversion is a cultural construct demanding explanation. (Coker, 2009)

Risk takers
	•	Risk taking and risk aversion are not all ofa piece, but depend on how people feel about the object of attention. (Wildavsky and Dake, 1990)
Professional risk takers
	•	Professional risk takers in the financial markets are more tolerant of losses, probably because they do not respond emotionally to every fluctuation. (Kahneman, 2012)
Risk taking
	•	Taking a risk is a deliberate choice to pursue a positive risk, even if negative risks are taken too. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	The strategy of taking risk is known elsewhere as a strategy of pursuing, enhancing, or exploiting positive risks. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Taking a risk is a deliberate choice to pursue a positive risk, even if negative risks are taken too. The strategy of taking risk is known elsewhere as a strategy of pursuing, enhancing, or exploiting positive risks. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Taking risk could include accepting some potential negative returns, so long as we are simultaneously pursuing positive risk. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Taking a risk does not need to mean avoidance of potentially negative returns, just to mean pursuit of potential positive returns. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Taking the risk would seem obvious if we estimate a large chance of positive outcomes and no chance of negative outcomes. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Taking the risk may necessitate investments or expenditures of resources.
	•	taking the risk may involve unobserved risks. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Today, most risk-taking is discouraged. (Coker, 2009)
Risk tranfert
	•	Transferring the risk means that we transfer some of therisk to another actor. (Newsome, 2013)
Risk retain
	•	Retaining the risk is a form of tolerating the risk, whereas transferring the risk implies that we cannot tolerate the risk. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Retaining the risk makes better sense if we were to believe that the other actor could not or would not cover our negative returns. (Newsome, 2013)
Residual risk
	•	It is accepted that there will be some residual risk of harm to people, property and the environment, but this has been ne reduced to what is considered to be a tolerable level as perceived by a responsible authority or other generally acceptable group (Wells, 1996)
	•	Residual risk must be accepted as being inevitable even though in many cases it must appear remote. (Wells, 1996)
	•	the postcontrol state is usually known as the residual risk. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Even where there is high confidence in the predicted course of events, there will be residual risk. (Omand, 2014)
	•	There are therefore some possible residual risk events that may be unlikely but have consequences that require nevertheless pre-emptive policy responses. (Omand, 2014)
Residual security risk
	•	Residual security risk is the security risk that remains after implementation of recommended safeguards. (Landoll, 2011)
	•	Residual security risk is an important element of information security risk assessments for several reasons. (Landoll, 2011)
Risk experts
	•	risk experts focus on the (arduous and skilled) tasks of trying to master the design, execution, and operation of their technology. It seems self evident to them that they are the best-qualified individuals for these jobs. Moreover, both their professional pride and market forces (e.g., waste minimization, liability reduction) provide strong incentives to control risks. (Fischhoff, 1995)
	•	the experts might be required to back up their claims with quantitative risk analyses. If so, then their job may seem to be over once the numbers come out satisfactorily (perhaps after some design revision). (Fischhoff, 1995)
Diligent analysts
	•	Diligent analysts do the best work they can, gathering observational data, adapting it to novel cases with expert judgment, and tying the pieces together with some model. (Fischhoff, 1995)
Risk decision
	•	Risk decisions are not about risks alone. One can accept large risks if they bring large benefits and reject small risks if they bring no good. (Fischhoff, 1995)
	•	Risk decisions are rarely about risks alone. (Fischhoff, 2015)
	•	Risk decisions meet with four kinds oflimitations: of empirical analysis, of social value appraisal, of "risk management", and ofthe assignment ofrisks and responsibilities. (Lowrance, 1980)
Global risk decisions
	•	Global risk decisions should be embedded in a more pluralistic and participatory process, where the knowledge of experts, decision-makers, and citizens are all included. (Griner, 2002)
Risk comparison
	•	[…]risk comparisons, in which an unfamiliar risk is contrasted with a more common one. Individuals are invited to use their response to the familiar situation as a guide to action in the new one, Certainly, it is legitimate to seek consistency in one’s actions. (Fischhoff, 1995)
	•	[…] risk comparisons, the choice of frame need not reflect malicious intent. People may just present the perspective that makes sense to them. If that perspective led to the choice that served their interests, there would be little natural incentive to think hard about alternative perspectives. (Fischhoff, 1995)
Risk balance
	•	a balance between our tolerance of the risks, our resources available to control the risks, and our values (Van Brunschot & Kennedy, 2008, pp. 12-13). (Newsome, 2013)
Risk driver
	•	The British Ministry of Defense (MOD) (2010a, p. 6) identifies risk by identifying their “driver” (“a factor that directly influences or causes changes”). (Newsome, 2013)
Numerical risk 
	•	Numerical risk estimates should therefore be based on thy best avail- able data and the appropriate use of exposure and dose response models to avoid the reliance on poorly characterized risks that have little -confidence" associated with them. (Williams and Paustenbach, 2002)
	•	Numerical estimates of risk can be expressed as a point estimate or at distribution of possible risk values. Point estimates refer to the use of a single value for each risk model parameter. resulting in a final estimate of risk that is also a single value. 
	•	numerical risk estimates should always be accompanied by descriptive and balanced risk information. (Williams and Paustenbach, 2002) 
	•	may be useful for screening analyses (Williams and Paustenbach, 2002)
Risk information
	•	Presenting risk information in a broader context can help ensure that risk management decisions will be cost-effective and will not result in unacceptable risk trade-offs from countervailing risks (Graham and Weiner, 1995). (Williams and Paustenbach, 2002)
	•	Information on the costs of a program or intervention relative to its benefits may be particularly important for risk managers. (Williams and Paustenbach, 2002)
Natural risk
	•	Natural risks tend to be traced to hazards but not threats. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Natural sources of risk (such as a river) traditionally have been described as hazards and no threats, even when they are clearly causing harm and are properly categorized as threats (such as when a river is flooding a twon), due to a linguistic bias toward natural hazards and human threats rather than natural threats and human hazards, but this is analytically misleading. Natural and human sources each can be hazards or threats. (Newsome, 2013)
Human risk
	•	Human risks tend to be traced to threats but not hazards. (Newsome, 2013)
Individual risk
	•	Characterizations of individual risk generally refer to the probability of harm for a random member of the population and arc not necessarily representative of a particular individual in the population. (Williams and Paustenbach, 2002)
	•	refers to the probabilistic number of health effect cases estimated in a population over a specified time period and does not represent an actuarial prediction of cases in the population. (Williams and Paustenbach, 2002)
	•	Only when such complex studies and calculations have been made is it possible to predict the chance that any individual living within a particular radius, or behaving in a certain way, will be injured by an accident. Such calculations are referred to as 'individual risk' calculations, and enable us to say things like 'a person who lives within half a mile radius of such and such a plant has a chance of x per annum of being injured from an accident at the plant'. (Great Britain and Health and Safety Executive, 1992)
	•	the risk to any particular individual, either a worker or a member of the public - this is 'individual risk'. (Great Britain and Health and Safety Executive, 1992)
Population risk
	•	Characterizations of population risk refer to the extent of harm for the population as a whole, and represent the summation of individual risks within a specified group. (Williams and Paustenbach, 2002)
	•	According to EPA (1995c). population risks can be described as either a probabilistic number of cases or an estimated percentage of the population with risk greater than some level. (Williams and Paustenbach, 2002)
	•	most often used for evaluating noncancer effects, is an estimate of the number of people or percentage of the population above a specified risk (or reference) level. (Williams and Paustenbach, 2002)
Risk distribution
	•	Risk distributions, on the other hand, refer to the use of a range of values for selected model parameters weighted by their likelihood of occurrence (EPA, 1997b). (Williams and Paustenbach, 2002)
	•	risk distributions may not reflect all sources of variability and uncertainty. In particular, most evaluations do not incorporate the uncertainty in biologic parameters, such as cancer potency. which may be of much greater importance than the variability in exposure parameters. (Williams and Paustenbach, 2002)
	•	considered to be the most optimal method for characterizing health risks (Williams and Paustenbach, 2002)
Cancer risk 
	•	Estimates of cancer risk are often based on the simplifying assumption that the dose-response relationship is linear at low doses (EPA, 1989a). Under this assumption, risk is directly related to intake […]. (Williams and Paustenbach, 2002)
Risk decision-making process
	•	[…] the risk decision-making process requires the consideration and weighing of a multitude of factors including economic analyses. legal requirements and acceptable risk criteria, societal values and public perceptions. court decisions, and indirect benefits. (Williams and Paustenbach, 2002)
	•	Communicating, the results of risk characterizations and risk management decisions will also become an increasingly important aspect of the risk decision- making process (Williams and Paustenbach, 2002)
	•	rising expectations about stakeholder involvement in the risk decision-making process, along with the greater ease of information transfer using computer technology, will require that a new approach that involves routine interaction with the public become standard practice in the future. (Williams and Paustenbach, 2002)

Health risks
	•	Health risks from a particular exposure scenario are often compared an individual's baseline risk from background exposures to the same contaminant. (Williams and Paustenbach, 2002)
	•	Health risks can he characterized according to several types of risk descriptors. (Williams and Paustenbach, 2002)
	•	health risks can be characterized for an individual in a specified population or the entire population group. (Williams and Paustenbach, 2002)
	•	Health risks may be characterized for the general population or for individuals that have higher exposures or susceptibilities to an agent. (Williams and Paustenbach, 2002)
Risk knowledge
	•	Risk knowledge might be divided into exposure, toxicity, and mitigation information. Laypeople could, in principle, have privileged knowledge about each component (Fischhoff, 1995)
Technological risk
	•	Technological risks are risks arising from technological failure, where the technology itself is the hazard (such as a part of an aircraft that falls on to a population below) or is the activator of a hazard (such as a drilling machine that activates an earthquake). (Newsome, 2013)
Technical assessment of risk
	•	The technical assessment of risk typically models the impacts of an event or human activity in terms of direct harms, including death, injuries, dis- ease, and environmental damages. (Kasperson et al., 1988)
Risk sources
	•	risk sources create a complex network of direct and indirect effects that are susceptible to change through social response. (Kasperson et al., 1988)
	•	Sources are important to identify because many responses to risk instinctively seek to control the uncertainty or returns associated with the risk, in the process neglecting opportunities to terminate the sources. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	The source of the risk is the hazard or threat. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Sources of risk are elements of the organisational environment that can bring some positive or negatives outcomes. (Tchankova, 2002)

Inherent risk
	•	the precontrol state of the risk is usually known as the inherent risk. (Newsome, 2013)
Security risk
	•	Risk has positive as well as negative possibilities that tend to be dismissed in writings on security. (Zedner, 2009)
	•	If we are to remain open to chance and to avoid the suffocation of security, even negative risks need to be subject to qualification not elimination. Yet we remain unwilling to entertain the possibility that risk, insecurity, and uncertainty may have positive qualities generally over-shadowed by the larger claims of security and certainty. (Zedner, 2009)
	•	It should be recognized that security risks are notoriously hard to measure quantitatively because they involve human actions. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	A security risk is the loss potential to an organization’s asset(s) that will likely occur if a threat is able to exploit a vulnerability. (Landoll, 2011)
	•	The basic equation for security risk calculation is Risk = Assets × threat × Vulnerability. For several reasons, this simple equation is merely an illustration of the principle that security risk is calculated based on an understanding of the asset value, the extent of the threat, and the likelihood of the threat exploiting an existing vulnerability. (Landoll, 2011)
	•	The basic security risk equation simply computes the relationship between asset value, threat frequency, and vulnerability likelihood. (Landoll, 2011)
	•	it is tempting to think that determining security risk is a simple calculation. However, determination of the value of assets, the frequency of a threat, and the likelihood of a vulnerability is clouded by uncertainty. (Landoll, 2011)
	•	Many risks to national interests are the result of gambles in intervention that were strictly discretionary. (Gray, 2014)
	•	Applying the principles of risk management to security therefore seems eminently sensible. (Omand, 2014)
	•	the final ‘business risk’ in the security domain will always rest with government. (Omand, 2014)
	•	Risk is the product of likelihood, vulnerability and impact should the event occur. Investment in security will in most cases consist of a balance between, on the one hand, measures to reduce high risk due to a combination of low probability (which it may well be hard to influence through policy) coupled with high levels of vulnerability and potential impact and, on the other hand, measures to reduce the high risk from events that may be much more likely but of lesser vulnerability and impact. (Omand, 2014)
Security risk assessment
	•	Security risk assessment the value of information assets, measures the strength of the overall security program, and provides the information necessary to make planned improvements based on information security risks. (Landoll, 2011)
	•	The security risk assessment is the tool of senior management that gives them an e ectiveness measurement of their security controls and an indication of how well their assets are protected. (Landoll, 2011)
	•	A security risk assessment is an important element in the overall security risk management process. (Landoll, 2011) 
	•	The security risk assessment takes on many names and can vary greatly in terms of method, rigor, and scope, but the core goal remains the same: assess the security risks to the organization’s information assets. (Landoll, 2011)
	•	There is no shortage of definitions for a security risk assessment (and many other closely associated names). Many of these de nàtions are overly complex or may be speci cally geared to an industry segment such as the federal government. (Landoll, 2011)
	•	The security risk assessment is central to this approach, as it assesses the risks that the security requirements may not be met and provides the basis for a risk-based decision for selecting security controls. (Landoll, 2011)
	•	In all the regulations, guidelines, and standards, security risk assessment has been defined in numerous ways. Some de nitions are more detailed than others in terms of how an assessment is performed. Some definitions focus on the result of the assessment, while others focus on the approach. (Landoll, 2011)
	•	For our purposes, a simpler security risk assessment definition is needed to cover any such approach or detail. (Landoll, 2011)
	•	Security Risk Assessment—A probability determination of asset losses based on asset valuation, threat analysis, and an objective review of current security controls the effectiveness. (Landoll, 2011)
	•	Aside from being required, a security risk assessment is an essential element of any corporation seeking to protect its information assets. (Landoll, 2011)
	•	A security risk assessment provides a review of the organization’s current imple- mentation of information asset protection. (Landoll, 2011)
	•	The fourth phase of a security risk assessment is security risk analysis. (Landoll, 2011)
	•	The fourth phase of a security risk assessment is security risk e security risk assessment phase consists of techniques and approaches for determining individual and overall security risk levels. This process can take many di erent forms, depending upon the security risk assessment method performed. (Landoll, 2011)
	•	The security risk assessment process will be discussed here by describing the process in the following three steps: 1. Determining security risk; 2. Creating security risk statements; 3. Team review of security risk statements analysis. (Landoll, 2011)
	•	The overall objective of the security risk assessment analysis process is to determine and convey the security risk to the organization’s assets. (Landoll, 2011)
	•	the public has to have confidence in the security authorities’ ability to make those risk judgments. (Omand, 2014)

Security risk management
	•	Security risk management involves the process of ensuring that the security risk posture of an organization is within acceptable bounds as defined by senior management. (Landoll, 2011)
Security risk analysis
	•	The security risk analysis depends on all the previous stages to supply the information required to analyze the security risk to the organization. (Landoll, 2011)
Security risk determination
	•	The security risk determination therefore is dependent upon the identi ed threats and vulnerabilities measured, and based on the probability of the threat/ vulnerability pair, the value of the asset affected, and the impact that the threat/ vulnerability pair will have on the asset. (Landoll, 2011)
Security risk measurement
Quantitative security risk assessment
	•	The quantitative approach to deriving and presenting security risk relies on specific formulas and calculations to determine the value of the security risk. (Landoll, 2011)
	•	A quantitative approach to determining and even presenting security risk has the advantages of being objective and expressed in terms of dollar figures. (Landoll, 2011)
Qualitative security risk assessment
	•	The qualitative approach to deriving and presenting security risk relies on subjective measures of asset valuation, threats, vulnerabilities, and ultimately the security risk. (Landoll, 2011)
	•	A qualitative approach to determining and presenting security risk has the advantage of being easy to understand and, in many cases, provides adequate indication of the organization’s security risk. (Landoll, 2011)
	•	However, a security risk measurement derived from such qualitative measures is, indeed, subjective and may not be trusted by some in management positions. (Landoll, 2011)
Security risk statement
	•	A security risk statement is a method of presenting related information in the expression of a security risk. (Landoll, 2011)
Risk sensitivy
	•	Risk sensitivity or risk averseness implies that we are less tolerant than others of risks in general or of a particular risk. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Risk sensitivity can change, so a person who has seemed relatively risk seeking to date may seem risk sensitive in old age. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Risk sensitivity varies between individuals, groups, departments, societies, and countries in ways that can be described as cultural. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Different organizations have different sensitivities due to internal decisions, strategies, and cultures. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	The Australian/New Zealand and ISO standard (International Organization for Standardization, 2009b) admits that “human and cultural factors” can change an organization’s sensitivity. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Societies, from the smallest community to transnational religions, tend to different cultures and thus tend to different attitudes toward risk (although globalization is a driver toward commonality). (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Risk sensitivity decreases when the speculative behaviour is institutionalized within trust seeting or regimes that the speculator perceives as fair and universal. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	When rule breaking is exposed, risk sensitivy increases (as well as altruistic punishment) (Van Brunschot & Kennedy, 2008, p. 10). (Newsome, 2013)
	•	These incompatible tolerability levels reflect the different risk sensitivities within each national culture and organizational culture, and the different practical constraints on each actor’s controls. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	In some cases, incompatible sensitivities or controls may not matter to cooperative operations, but they could interfere with interoperability. (Newsome, 2013)
Risk insensitivity
	•	Risk insensitivity at higher authorities has been conceptualized as risk permissiveness or lack of regulation (Jablonowski, 2009, Chapter 6). (Newsome, 2013)
Risk trap
	•	the ‘risk trap’ − doing too little or doing too much can both prove equally fatal (Rasmussen 2007:39). The trick is to do just enough. (Coker, 2009)
Risk seeking
	•	Risk seeking implies active pursuit. (Newsome, 2013)
Risk information
	•	specific terms or concepts used in risk information may have quite different meanings for varying social and cultural groups. (Kasperson et al., 1988)
Risk matrix
	•	Risk matrices are the most recognizable ways to communicate risk, thanks to their simplicity and frequent use, although matrices typically oversimplify the records on which they are based and often use misleading scales or risk levels. Conventional risk matrices are formed by two dimensions representing returns and likelihood respectively. A fair and transparent matrix should have symmetrical scales on each dimension and should admit that the risk in each cell is a product of these dimensions. This mathematical consistency produces risk levels each with a definite order and clean boundaries. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	many risk matrices assign risk levels that are not mathematically justified and are misleading. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	The risks in a risk matrix can be represented by dots, each placed in a cell corresponding with the risk’s associated likelihood and returns, where each dot’s size or color corresponds with the risk’s rank. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Risks can be plotted within a matrix to show how risks have changed over time. A particular risk could be plotted in the same matrix twice—at an earlier point in time and a later point in time. If the risk level has changed in that time, an arrow between the plots can represent the change. The change might be due to controls on the risk: In this case, some users have referred to the matrix as a control effectiveness map. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	The ISO defines a risk matrix as a “tool for ranking and displaying risks by defining ranges for consequences and likelihood”. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Risk matrices are used during hazard identification and risk assessment processes and provide a construct for people needing to display the two variable relationship between likelihood and consequence that are considered to be the elements of risk. (Pickering and Cowley, 2010)
	•	The purpose of a matrix is to reduce the continuum of risk into ranges or bands such as high, medium or low. These bands are often allocated colours such as red for the highest risks to green for the lowest. Sometimes each band in a matrix is allocated a numerical value or range. The multiplication of likelihood and consequence implies a quantitative basis although it may not be widely understood. The multiplication operator produces lines of equal risk that a matrix cannot model accurately and thereby introduces risk reversal errors. Weaknesses in matrices are further compounded by subjectivity and bias introduced by users and the value of such tools is brought into doubt. (Pickering and Cowley, 2010)
	•	Risk matrices are very commonly used during hazard identification and risk assessment processes (Cook 2008). They are used to: articulate the level of risk associated with an identified hazard; to rank risks and thereby propose actions; to justify a proposal or action; and to re-assess risk to demonstrate the effectiveness of a control (residual risk) (Cook 2008; Cox 2008; Smith, Siefert and Drain 2008). (Pickering and Cowley, 2010)
	•	Risk matrices provide a construct for people needing to display the two variable relationship between likelihood and consequence that are considered to be the elements of risk (Standards Australia 2004). (Pickering and Cowley, 2010)
	•	A Risk Matrix is a tool used to allocate a level of risk to a hazard from a pre-determined set. (Pickering and Cowley, 2010)
	•	Risk Matrices are common within, and specific to, many different industries and business sectors including; medicine (McIlwain 2006); construction (Bender 2004); aerospace (Moses and Malone); major facilities (Filippin and Dreher 2004; Iannacchione, Varley and Brady 2008); railways (Kennedy 1997); agriculture (Hewett, Quinn et al. 2004); mining (Stoklosa 1999; Md-Nor, Kecojevic, Komljenovic and Groves 2008). Some matrices have been developed for specfic applications within the occupational health and safety (OHS) domain (Cook 2008). Some organisations use one matrix for assessment of risk associated with business risk and a different matrix to assess risk associated with exposure to work place hazards. These may be mis-matched in their allocation of descriptors of likelihood and consequence values and thus cause confusion. (Pickering and Cowley, 2010)
	•	Risk matrices are tools that allow the categorisation of risk using, for example, “high”, “medium” or “low”. (Pickering and Cowley, 2010)
	•	Matrices are typically an array of cells presented as squares or rectangles in rows and columns representing risk categories or levels. The number of risk categories within a matrix is determined by the organisational requirement for specifications with respect to the risk category (Smith et al., 2008, p. 2). (Pickering and Cowley, 2010)
	•	Some matrices are purely qualitative and use words to express likelihood and consequence (Bender, 2004, p. 2) (Standards Australia 2004). (Pickering and Cowley, 2010)
	•	Semi-quantitative and quantitative risk matrices incorporate in the likelihood or consequence arguments, data derived from injury statistics or epidemiological studies, for example. (Pickering and Cowley, 2010)
	•	If the numerical value of both likelihood and consequence are known, then the quantitative measure of risk is also known basedon R = L x C. In this case, a Risk Matrix is not required to rank hazards as this will be self evident. (Pickering and Cowley, 2010)
	•	Risk Matrices are used to categorise and prioritise risks. (Pickering and Cowley, 2010)
	•	The lack of specifications for Risk Matrix design may cause confusion through the variations in the number of rows and columns, the values on the x and y axes and the direction of risk scaling within the matrix. (Pickering and Cowley, 2010)
	•	A risk matrix is a mechanism to characterize and rank process risks that are typically identified through one or more multifunctional reviews (e.g., process hazard analysis, audits, or incident investigation). This paper describes a procedure for developing a fuzzy risk matrix that may be used for emerging fuzzy logic applications in different safety analyses (e.g., LOPA). (Markowski and Mannan, 2008)
	•	Risk assessment matrix is a tool to conduct subjective risk assessment for use in different process hazard analysis (PHA), including the layer of protection analysis (LOPA). (Markowski and Mannan, 2008)
	•	The bases for risk matrix are the definition of risk as a combination of severity of the consequences occurring in a certain accident scenario and its frequency. (Markowski and Mannan, 2008)
	•	Risk matrices—tables mapping “frequency” and “severity” ratings to corresponding risk priority levels—are popular in applications as diverse as terrorism risk analysis, highway con- struction project management, office building risk analysis, climate change risk management, and enterprise risk management (ERM). (Cox, 2008)
	•	A risk matrix is a table that has several categories of “probability,” “likelihood,” or “frequency” for its rows (or columns) and several categories of “severity,” “impact,” or “consequences” for its columns (or rows, respectively). It associates a recommended level of risk, urgency, priority, or management action with each row-column pair, that is, with each cell. (Cox, 2008)
	•	The use of such risk matrices to set priorities and guide resource allocations has also been recommended in national and international standards. (Cox, 2008)
	•	Risk matrices have been widely praised and adopted as simple, effective approaches to risk man- agement. They provide a clear framework for systematic review of individual risks and portfolios of risks; convenient documentation for the rationale of risk rankings and priority setting; relatively simple- appearing inputs and outputs, often with attractively colored grids; opportunities for many stakeholders to participate in customizing category definitions and ac- tion levels; and opportunities for consultants to train different parts of organizations on “risk culture” concepts at different levels of detail, from simply posi- tioning different hazards within a predefined matrix to helping thought leaders try to define risk categories and express “risk appetite” preferences in the color coding of the cells. (Cox, 2008)
	•	Risk matrices are different enough from other topics (such as multivariate classification, clustering, and learning with correct classes provided as training data) to require separate investigation of their proper- ties, in part because “risk” is not a measured attribute, but is derived from frequency and severity inputs through a priori specified formulas such as Risk = Frequency × Severity. (Cox, 2008)
	•	Help leaders decice which risks are acceptable, which are not, and what can be done to control and minimize hazards. (Walick, 1994)
	•	A risk matrix, in the context of safety management, is a technique for assigning a risk class to a potential accident1 or to a hazard in accordance with the predicted severity and absolute likelihood of the potential accident or hazard. (Cook, 2008)
	•	This technique involves the construction and application of a two dimensional matrix of the form illustrated in Table 1. The resulting risk class defines how that accident or hazard will be managed throughout the life of the system with which it is associated. (Cook, 2008)
	•	The risk matrix technique itself is not solely to blame for these issues. They relate to the categorisation used and the lack of coherent ways of addressing the requirement in different parts of the overall process. However the risk matrix forms a central focus for these issues. (Cook, 2008)
	•	Effective use of the risk matrix requires a consistent and coherent approach to the process of risk assessment and the processes around it. It also requires knowledge of various techniques for addressing safety requirements and discussing the concepts meaningfully. (Cook, 2008)
	•	The risk matrix can be applied to hazards, hazardous events or potential accidents. (Cook, 2008)
	•	The risk matrix technique addresses safety requirements that are essentially quantitative in nature. (Cook, 2008)
	•	The risk matrix addresses the level of risk under each severity category. This level of risk can be expressed as a probability of a harmful event occurring one or more times in a given time period, as a mean frequency of such events occurring or as a mean time between such events. (Cook, 2008)
	•	the risk matrix is not the only means of assessing compliance. (Cook, 2008)
	•	The risk matrix addresses the requirement, not the target. (Cook, 2008)
Risk matrix tailoring
	•	‘Tailoring the risk matrix’ is the process of setting the risk class for each severity/likelihood combination with reference to the safety criteria. (Cook, 2008)
Risk class
	•	Accidents (or hazardous events or hazards as appropriate, see section 2) and systems are categorised with a risk class that denotes how they will be managed. (Cook, 2008)

Risk construction
	•	The risk construction process itself, the active search for explanations to a mysterious situation, may be interpreted as a collective process of coping. (Poumadère and Mays, 2003)
Risk acceptance
	•	Risk acceptance is another strategy used in mitigating risk. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	As the name implies, risk acceptance is simply where an organization assumes the risk to an asset. (Vellani, 2007)
Risk event
	•	[…]risk event, is given meaning through a complex and iterative process of interactions between different actors in the social structure. The meaning it is given will then determine the secondary, tertiary and subsequent effects that the risk can have upon different social entities (e.g. a local community or a company). It will also constrain the nature of the actions taken in response (e.g. legislative, organisational and economic). (Breakwell, 2014)
Risk level
	•	Like security, risks can be categorized through a hierarchy of levels, say from the global level down to the personal. (Newsome, 2013)
Objective risk
	•	defined according to statistical calculations of the probabilities of 'adverse' events) (Boholm, 1996)
	•	Consequence and likelihood, the elements of the mathematical definition of ‘objective risk’, are only two among many uncertain factors that make up risk in reallife. (Frühling, 2014)
Cultural meanings of risk
	•	the cultural meanings of risk could be revealed through the use of the tenets of symbolic anthropology. (Boholm, 1996)
Zero risk
	•	Zero risk is an undesirable and unattainable goal.12 9 Regulators rarely face a choice between risk and no risk. They must choose instead among various options with different degrees of risk. (Sachs, 2011)
Risk from nuclear installations 
	•	the main risk from nuclear installations concerns the potential for release of material which emits ionising radiations. (Great Britain and Health and Safety Executive, 1992)
Risk framing
	•	The framing of the issue may point to it being one where a decision on proportionality of action requires information on the risks. In such cases, we need to characterise the risk quantitatively and qualitatively, to describe how it arises and how it impacts on those affected and society at large. Such information is needed in order to inform later consideration of options for risk reduction. (Great Britain and Health and Safety Executive, 2001)
	•	risk-related actions needs to start with an analysis of what major societal actors such as governments, companies, the scientific community and the general public select as risks and what types of problems they label as risk problems (rather than opportunities or innovation potentials, for example). In technical terms this is called ‘framing’. (Renn, 2007b)
	•	Framing in this context encompasses the selection and interpretation of phenomena as relevant risk topics (Tversky and Kahneman, 1981; van der Sluijs et al, 2003; Goodwin and Wright, 2004). This process of framing is already part of governance structure since official agencies (for example food standard agencies), risk and opportunity producers (such as the food industry), those affected by risks and opportunities (such as consumer organizations) and interested bystanders (such as the media or an intellectual elite) are all involved and often in conflict with each other when framing the issue. (Renn, 2007b)
	•	Whether a consensus evolves about what requires consid- eration as a relevant risk depends on the legitimacy of the selection rule. The acceptance of selection rules rests on two conditions: first, all actors need to agree with the underlying goal (often legally prescribed, such as prevention of health detriments or guarantees of undisturbed environmental quality, for example purity laws for drinking water); second, they need to agree with the implications derived from the present state of knowledge (whether and to what degree the identified hazard impacts the desired goal). (Renn, 2007b)
	•	Values and evidence can be viewed as the two sides of a coin: the values govern the selec- tion of the goal whereas the evidence governs the selection of cause–effect claims. Both need to be properly investigated when analysing risk governance, but it is of particular importance to understand the values shaping the inter- ests, perceptions and concerns of the different stakeholders as well as to identify methods for capturing how these concerns are likely to influence, or impact on, the debate about a particular risk. The actual measurements of these impacts should then be done in the most professional manner, including the characterization of uncertainties (Keeney, 1992; Pidgeon and Gregory, 2004; Gregory, 2004). (Renn, 2007b)
	•	Even if there is a common agreement of what should be framed as risk issues, there may be problems in monitoring the environment for signals of risks. (Renn, 2007b)
Acceptable risk
	•	A risk deemed ‘acceptable’ is usually limited in terms of negative consequences so is taken on without risk reduction or mitigation measures being envisaged. (Renn, 2007a)
Simple risk
	•	‘Simple’ risk problems can be managed using a ‘routine-based’ strategy which draws on traditional decision-making instruments, best practice as well as time-honoured trial and error. (Renn, 2007a)
	•	Simple risks, such as home fires, where the causes are obvious, “can be managed using a ‘routine- based’ strategy, such as introducing a law or regulation.” (Newsome, 2013)
Complex risk
	•	complex risks are thus usefully addressed on the basis of ‘risk-informed’ and ‘robustness-focused’ strategies, (Renn, 2007a)
	•	aim at accessing and acting on the best available scientific expertise and at reducing a system’s vulnerability to known hazards and threats by improving its buffer capacity (Renn, 2007a)
	•	Complex risks arise from “difficulties in identifying and quantifying causal links between a multitude of potential causal agents and specific observed effects. Examples of highly complex risks include the risks of failures of large interconnected infrastructures and the risks of critical loads to sensitive ecosystems.” They “can be addressed on the basis of accessing and acting on the bestavailable scientific expertise, aiming for a ‘risk- informed’ and ‘robustness-focused’ strategy. Robustness refers to the degree of reliability of the risk reduction measures to withstand threatening events or processes that have not been fully understood or anticipated.” (Newsome, 2013)
Uncertain risk
	•	uncertain risks are better managed using ‘precaution-based’ and ‘resilience-focused’ strategies. (Renn, 2007a)
	•	pursue the goal of applying a precautionary approach in order toensure the reversibility of critical decisions and of increasing a system’s coping capacity to the point where it can withstand surprises. (Renn, 2007a)
	•	Uncertain risks arise from “a lack of clarity or quality of the scientific or technical data. Highly uncertain risks include many natural disasters, acts of terrorism and sabotage, and the long-term effects of introducing genetically-modified species into the natural environment.” They “are better managed using ‘precaution-based’ and ‘resilience-focused’ strategies, with the intention being to apply a precautionary approach to ensure the reversibility of critical decisions and to increase a systems’ coping capacity to the point where it can withstand surprises.” (Newsome, 2013)
Ethics of risk
	•	Developing an ‘ethics of risk’, as O’Malley proposes (O’Malley 2004b: 334), requires recognition of the varieties of risk in play and therefore the different ways in which risk may be deployed as a resource in the pursuit of ‘a democratized, agonic politics of security’ (O’Malley 2004b: 338). (Zedner, 2009)
Ambiguous risk
	•	for ‘ambiguous’ risk problems the appropriate strategy consists of a ‘discourse-based’ strategy which seeks to create tolerance and mutual understanding of conflicting views and values with a view to eventually reconciling them. (Renn, 2007a)
	•	Ambiguous risks result “from divergent or contested perspectives on the justification, severity, or wider meanings associated with a given threat. Risks subject to high levels of ambiguity include food supplements, hormone treatment of cattle, passive smoking, some aspects of nanotechnology, and synthetic genomics.” The “appropriate approach comprises a ‘discourse-based’ strategy which seeks to create tolerance and mutual understanding ofconflicting views and values with a view to eventually reconciling them.” (Newsome, 2013)
Risk-as-feelings hypothesis 
	•	The risk-as-feelings hypothesis is shown to explain a wide range of phenomena that have resisted interpretation in cognitive– consequentialist terms. (Loewenstein et al., 2001)
	•	risk-as-feelings hypothesis, provides a parsimonious account of a number of risk-related phenomena that are not explained by existing consequentialist models of risky decision making. (Loewenstein et al., 2001)
	•	The risk-as-feelings hypothesis, illustrated in Figure 3 , postulates that responses to risky situations (including decision making) result in part from direct (i.e., not cortically mediated) emotional influences, including feelings such as worry, fear, dread, or anxiety. People are assumed to evaluate risky alternatives at a cognitive level, as in traditional models, based largely on the probability and desirability of associated consequences. Such cognitive evaluations have affective consequences, and feeling states also exert a reciprocal influence on cognitive evaluations. (Loewenstein et al., 2001)
	•	feeling states are postulated to respond to factors, such as the immediacy of a risk, that do not enter into cognitive evaluations of the risk and also respond to probabilities and outcome values in a fashion that is different from the way in which these variables enter into cognitive evaluations. (Loewenstein et al., 2001)
	•	The risk-as-feelings hypothesis is similar to the somatic marker hypothesis, the affect- as-information perspective, and the affect heuristic in drawing attention to the important role played by affect in decision making, but the risk-as-feelings hypothesis has a somewhat different focus. (Loewenstein et al., 2001)
	•	the risk-as-feelings hypothesis posits that, in addition, emotions often produce behavioral responses that depart from what individuals view as the best course of action. (Loewenstein et al., 2001)
	•	the risk-as-feelings hypothesis is only interesting if the addition of feelings as a predictor variable makes risky choice more predictable, both within and across different decision domains and contexts. (Loewenstein et al., 2001)
Chemical risk
	•	Chemical risk is determined by the exposure in combination with the hazard, i.e. the inherent properties of the chemical to cause harm in a biological system. The hazard is defined by its severity (type of adverse effect or endpoint) and the potency (the doses/exposures needed for the adverse effect to materialize). (Swedish Chemicals Agency et al., 2007)
Risk factor
	•	Potential targets are often identified by situation or inherent factors that are usually termed risk factors (also indicators, markers, or correlates). (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Risk factors correlate with a particular risk but are not necessarily sources of causes. (Newsome, 2013)

Risk evaluation
	•	risk evaluation, broadens the picture to include pre-risk aspects such as choice of technology, social need for the specific risk agent (substitution possible?), risk–benefit balances, political priorities, potential for conflict resolution and social mobilization potential. (Renn, 2007b)
Risk reaction
	•	People react to the prospect of risk at two levels: they evaluate the risk cognitively, and they react to it emotionally. (Loewenstein et al., 2001)
Risk radars
	•	Risk radars are segmented, concentric circles that normally are used to represent time (circles further from the center represent time further into the future) and risk categories or risk owners (each segment of the pie wouldrepresent a different category or owner). Risk radars are useful for drawing attention to risks whose control is most urgent.Moving outward from the center circle (which normally represents the present) each concentric circle would represent some interval of time further into the future (say, an interval of 1 year). Segments or arcs of the concentric circles can be delineated to differentiate risk by category or owner, depending on whether the categories or owners were most salient. Each risk’s level or rank can be represented by a distinct color or number. (Newsome, 2013)
Risk spreading
	•	Risk spreading is a strategy used in moving assets to different geographic areas so that if one area is attacked, the consequence is limited to that area. (Vellani, 2007)
Risk sensitivity
	•	Risk sensitivity, measured as the average risk rating given by respondents to several hazards different from the one, which is being modeled, has been found to be an important factor in perceived risk (Sjoberg, 2004a).
	•	In practice, risk sensitivity is highly variable across persons and groups and is dynamic within the lifecycle of these actors as they react to risks, interact with each other, and mature. Some of the variance and dynamism is objective (for instance, a person who is exposed to a risk should be more sensitive to it than a person who is not exposed), but most people are subjective, so their sensitivities are likely to be inflated or deflated for parochial or even irrational reasons. Some authors like to describe risk as an unavoidably “mental construct” and remind us that any risk assessment must reflect inherently psychological “risk perceptions” (Renn, 2008, p. 21). (Newsome, 2013)
	•	A value relative to the resource’s tolerance for risk exposure. (Wheeler, 2011)
Risk ranking
	•	The success of risk-ranking depends on the scientific judgment involved in identifying po- tentially relevant outcomes and providing the initial estimates. (Fischhoff, 2015)
	•	The success of risk-ranking also depends on the ethical judgments made in defining its key terms (3–5, 43). (Fischhoff, 2015)
	•	Essentialy a risk ranking is a judgment of one risk’s scale relative to another. Fewer ranks or levels (points on an ordinal scale) are easier for the respondent to understand and to design with mutually exclusive coding rules for each level. Three-point or 5-point scales are typical because they have clear middle, top, and bottom levels. More levels would give a false sense of increased granularity as the boundaries between levels become fuzzy. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	
Large risk
	•	Large risks may be acceptable if they bring large benefits and there are no good ways to reduce them. (Fischhoff, 2015)
Small risk
	•	Small risks may be unacceptable if they bring small benefits or could be easily reduced (3, 43, 44, 61). (Fischhoff, 2015)
Risk factor
	•	The concept ‘risk fac- tors’ is used in social medicine, public health and epi- demiology to point to factors which may increase the probability to get affected by a disease, while risk indicators may also be indirect contributing factors (e.g. social conditions for the breakout of a disease). (Brauch, 2011)

Risk avoidance
	•	The Canadian government defines risk avoidance as “an informed decision to avert or to withdraw from an activity in order not to be exposed to a particular risk” (Public Safety Canada, 2012, p. 82). (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Risk avoidance is an extreme measure since it hampers business. (Vellani, 2007)
Risk prioritization
	•	The Canadian government regers to risk prioritization as “the ranking of risks in terms of their combined likelihood and impact estimates” (Public Safety Canada, 2012, p. 84). (Newsome, 2013)
	•	In order to prioritize risks in practice, it is thus necessary to gather and analyse relevant information, and to appraise that information with reference to subjective values and preferences. (Frühling, 2014)
	•	Ultimately, the order of priority that results from the characterization of strategic risks is thus not only based on the decision makers’ views of national interests and assessed adversary capabilities and intentions, but also on their tolerance of uncertainty, of present and future threats, and the balance between the cost and benefit of specific defence preparations. (Frühling, 2014)
	•	Preparations for tactical warning therefore must be focused on the realization of a particular, defined strategic risk, known and prioritized in advance. (Frühling, 2014)

Risk tolerance
	•	Risk tolerances may vary as well as anticipation and intrusiveness in regulation.(Hood et al., 2001)
Risk tolerability threshold
	•	Most authorities and standards prescribe the establishment of a risk tolerability threshold, below which a negatice risk is tolerable and above which it should be controlled. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Since stakeholders, managers, and risks are diverse, authorities and standards normally leave users to find their own tolerability threshold and do not prescribe where the threshold should fall, although project managers have been advised to tolerate risks that score less than 30-40 on a 100-point scale (Heerkens, 2002, p. 148). (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Visually, identifying tolerable risks involves assessing the risks, assessing our tolerability level or threshold, and plotting the risks on a linear scale, where risks higher or lower than the threshold would be intolerable. (Newsome, 2013)
Risk estimation
	•	Risk estimates are calculated using probability- based techniques. such as Monte Carlo analysis. and can be presented as an entire probability distribution or selected percentiles (e.g. 50th. 90th. and 95th). (Williams and Paustenbach, 2002)
	•	The estimation of risk depends on an exposure and/or vulnerability assessment. (Renn, 2007b)
	•	estimates of risk, whether made by scientists or by laypeople, cannot escape containing elements of "subjectivity", of human opinion. Subjectivity enters into the very defining of the questions, and into the designing of the experiments used in assembling evidence, and then into the weighing of the social importance of the risk. (Lowrance, 1980)
	•	‘Risk estimates’ always involve a prospective estimate based on the probability, frequency and intensity of damages that are often based on specific ‘risk analyses’. (Brauch, 2011)

Exposure
	•	Exposure refers to the contact of the hazardous agent with the target (individuals, ecosystems, buildings and so forth); (Renn, 2007b)
Vulnerability
	•	vulnerability describes the various degrees to which the target experiences harm or damage as a result of the exposure (for example the immune systems among a target population, vulnerable groups or structural deficiencies in buildings). (Renn, 2007b)

Financial risk
	•	Nous allons voir que les risques financiers (actuariel, systématique, crédit et liquidité) n’affectent pas tous la même section du bilan. (Dumont, 2011)
	•	En effet, la compagnie d’assurance peut avoir recours à des produits au niveau de l’actif ou du passif pour sa gestion du risque. (Dumont, 2011)
	•	les risques financiers auxquels la compagnie d’assurance est exposée sont les suivants : risque actuariel, risque systématique, risque de crédit, risque de liquidité, risque opérationnel et risque légal (Laporte, 2002). (Dumont, 2011)
Acturial risk
	•	Le risque actuariel est relié à la collecte de primes en échange de l’assurance offerte à l’assuré. Ce risque découle du fait que la prime est inadéquate au regard du risque encouru par l’assureur. Le risque systématique est un risque que l’assureur ne peut complètement éliminer. Celui-ci provient d’une fluctuation des taux d’intérêt (le plus important), du risque de base (« basis risk ») et de l’inflation. Ces trois facteurs auront pour effet de faire fluctuer la valeur du passif et de l’actif de l’assureur. (Dumont, 2011)
Credit risk
	•	le risque de crédit est le risque qu’un emprunteur ne puisse respecter les clauses du contrat. Ce risque est par exemple présent si la compagnie d’assurance a négocié un swap. Par contre, il est important de mentionner que le notionnel n’est pas transigé dans un swap de taux d’intérêt et par conséquent le risque dans une telle situation est limité à l’échange de flux moné- taire différentiel entre les deux contreparties. (Dumont, 2011)
Liquidity risk 
	•	Le risque de liquidité est quant à lui causé par l’incertitude au niveau des réclamations futures. En cas d’une hausse importante inattendue des réclamations, l’assureur fait face à un risque de liquidité s’il doit vendre des actifs rapidement, donc dans ce cas souvent en dessous de sa valeur marchande. (Dumont, 2011)
Non finacial risk
	•	Un risque non financier, en termes simples, est un danger éventuel, non prévisible. La prévisibilité enlèverait à l’aléa son assurabilité. (Dumont, 2011)
	•	Le Code civil du Québec classifie les risques non financiers assurables en deux grandes catégories d’assurance, à savoir les assurances maritimes et les asssurances terrestres, lesquels se subdivisent également en risques de personnes et risques de dommages (biens ou responsabilités). Certains sont des risques directement reliés à la nature (tremblements de terre, inondations, volcans, etc.), d’autres sont le fait de l’homme (risques technologiques, risques aériens, risques automobiles, accidents du travail, pollution par hydrocarbures, bris de machines, etc.).  (Dumont, 2011)
Direct risk
	•	Mentionnons aussi une classification entre risques directs (incendie) et risques indirects (pertes d’exploitation). (Dumont, 2011)
Indired risk
	•	Mentionnons aussi une classification entre risques directs (incendie) et risques indirects (pertes d’exploitation). (Dumont, 2011)
Schotastic risk
	•	les risques dits stochastiques n’occasionnent pas de dommages directs mais accroissent la possibilité que d’autres risques se réalisent (par exemple, le fait de fumer et d’inhaler du tabac accroît indirectement la possibilité d’avoir un cancer du poumon) (Dumont, 2011)
	•	La liste des risques s’allongent en permanence en raison des progrès technologiques mais il importe surtout de souligner que les risques se mesurent par deux paramètres : leur probabilité ou fréquence et leur gravité ou sévérité. (Dumont, 2011)
Calculable risk
	•	If there are only calculable risks, organizations can control what is otherwise uncontrollable. (Clarke, 1999)
Risk regulation
	•	Risk regulation does not aspire to eliminate risk but to substitute acceptable for unacceptable risk (Heyvaert, 2011)
	•	the centrality of risk to regulation is a further iteration of the ‘Audit Explosion’, representing rituals of verification and legitimation with little and sometimes even dysfunctional substantive impacts (Rothstein et al., 2006)
	•	The regulation of risk is nowadays increasingly being undertaken at European or international level in the form of legally binding instruments on Member States – such as directives, treaties and conventions adopted in the wake of the creation of new global markets andnew technologies. (Great Britain and Health and Safety Executive, 2001)
	•	Regulations have been in place as a means to minimize risks to the consumers. (Renn, 2011)
	•	Regulatory actions are based on two distinct elements, risk assessment , the subject of this study, and risk management. (National Research Council, 1983)
	•	[…] regulation of risk, defined as governmental interference with market or social processes to control potential adverse consequences to health. It seeks to describe, compare, and explain variation in the way risks are handled by the state. (Hood et al., 2001)
	•	[…] risk regulation is interpreted by many to reflect broader political and cultural change. (Hood et al., 2001)
	•	Yet casual observation, academic inquiry, and official surveys alike indicate substantial variety in the way risks and hazards are handled by the state. We can observe variation both between one tate and another and – perhaps more strikingly – between one domain of risk and another within a single state. (Hood et al., 2001)
	•	[…] substantial variation can be observed in the particular risks and hazards that are chosen for regulation and the way regulation works. (Hood et al., 2001)
	•	[…] even where standards are common, enforcement practices can vary sharply among states (see Baldwin and Daintith 1992). (Hood et al., 2001)
	•	 […] it often happens that there is a strong international exchange of knowledge, views, and cultures within particular risk domains, such as chemicals, and air and sea transport, but very little cross-domain exchange within states (see Breyer 1993). The result is a policy and intellectual ‘archipelago’ of risk domains isolated from one another, with very different policy stances across the various domains. (Hood et al., 2001)
	•	But this approach is far from universal, and indeed critics of risk regulation policy often point to disparities between state regulatory effort in relation to different kinds of risks. (Hood et al., 2001)
	•	The design of institutional machinery and boundaries for risk regulation also varies sharply from one domain to another. (Hood et al., 2001)
Risk regulation regimes
	•	[…] midi-trade wars often stem from differences in risk regulation regimes between states. (Hood et al., 2001)
	•	[…] risk regulation regimes can vary widely even, perhaps especially, within the same ‘regulatory state’. (Hood et al., 2001)
	•	‘Regime’ connotes the overall way risk is regulatedin a particular policy domain. (Hood et al., 2001)
	•	On exploring the notion of risk regulation regimes, we draw on several approaches to risk. (Hood et al., 2001)
	•	We want to find a way of describing, comparing, and explaining variety in risk)regulation regimes – a variety that is often observed by commentators, but rarely explored beyond the stage of anecdote or first principles. Accordingly, we seek to describe jow these regimes work – and fail – and to examine and understand the forces shaping them. (Hood et al., 2001)
	•	We use the term ‘regime’ to denote the complex of institutional geography, rules, practice, and animating ideas that are associated with the regulation of a particual risk or hazard. (Hood et al., 2001)
	•	We see risk regulation regimes as systems. We view them as sets of interacting or at least related parts rather than a ‘single-cell’ phenomena. (Hood et al., 2001)
	•	We see risk regulation regimes as entities that have some degree of continuity over time. (Hood et al., 2001)
	•	Rsk regulation regimes have their suden climaxterics as well as their incremental adjustments and steady trends. (Hood et al., 2001)
	•	[…] the concept of ‘regime’ for our purpose implies a set of characteristics that are often retained beyond the tenure in office of any one leader, government minister, or political party. (Hood et al., 2001)
	•	[…] regimes are conceived as relatively bounded systems that can be specified at different levels of breadth. (Hood et al., 2001)
	•	We have to specify carefully, therefore, what level of ‘regime is being analysed, and the kind of risk the regime addresses. (Hood et al., 2001)
	•	The term ‘regime’ and ‘regime’ theory has been developed for similar purposes – that is, to descibre variety in systems of governance – in several fields. (Hood et al., 2001)
	•	Though diverse in disciplinary orinin, all of these different usages of ‘regime’ incorporate the first of the two features mentioned earlier, that is, a more or less elaborate and explicit ‘system’ perspective. Most of them embody the second and third features as well, in that they imply a view of regimes as relatively enduring phenomena and of systems that can be nested in larger systems. (Hood et al., 2001)
	•	The concept of regimes in risk regulation is also related to several other analytic themes, notably in system theory and related fields of organizaiotnal and regulatory analyssi, even though the word ‘regime’ may not be used in such analysis. (Hood et al., 2001)
	•	[…] cultural and organization theorists have taken a particular interest in the regulation of risk and hazard, identifying alternative polar ‘world-views’ that come into play when such issues are in debate (see Adams 1995; Schwarz and Thompson 1990). (Hood et al., 2001)
	•	This discussion of usage of ‘regime’’ and some related approaches is by no mean comprehensive. (Hood et al., 2001)
	•	There is, however, no single correct way of conceiving risk regulation regimes. (Hood et al., 2001)
	•	a risk regulation regime-centred approach to looking at the social handling of risk and hazard is intended to be a ‘middle way’ approach to institutional analysis. It is designed to capture the variety that is left out of macroscopic ‘risk society’ or ‘audit society’ approaches, which inevitably can deal only in broad-gauge interpretation. At the same time, it is designed to achieve a broader and more general perspective than is yielded by microscopic approaches, which tend to focus on the setting of safety standards alone, or on the details of a particular hazard, or both. (Hood et al., 2001)
	•	A dimensional comparison of risk regulation regimes should ideally have at least three related features. First, it should begin at a fairly simple and self-explanatory level, making distinctions that are broad enough to cover a wide range of the regulatory landscape. Second, its basic categories should be capable of being progressively disaggregated into more fine-grained differentiations. (Hood et al., 2001)
European risk regulation model 
	•	When called upon to regulate risk, the EU carries the threefold onus to (i) protect its people(s); (ii) en- sure the functioning of the internal market; and also (iii) to allocate the resources available wisely and efficiently. (Alemanno, 2011)
	•	in the EU risk decision-making the rational, technocratic soul is matched by another soul, which is less systematic, less predictable, in short, more human. (Alemanno, 2011)
	•	the EU risk regulation identity has been shaped and is evolving under the often-contra- dictory directions provided by its dual souls. Therefore it is no surprise that today the resulting tension between the necessity for a rational, evidence-based decision-making and the wider demand for a  exible, precautionary-oriented regulatory approach stands as the de ning feature of the EU risk regulation. In particular, by allowing restrictive regulatory action in situations of documented scienti c uncertainty, the precautionary principle embodies the uneasy co- existence between the two souls. (Alemanno, 2011)
Risk regulator
	•	Regulators and policy makers, on the other hand, are generally poor communicators. (Lofstedt, 2011)
Public risk regulator
	•	Public risk regulators often use pre-screening activities to allocate risks to different agencies or to predefined procedures. Sometimes risks may seem to be less severe and it may be adequate to cut short risk or concern assessment. (Renn, 2007b)
Comparative regime perspective
	•	It brings out systemic interaction; it helps us to identify puzzles and questions that are invisible from other perspectives; and it can serve as a policy tool to explore the justification for regulatory variety. (Hood et al., 2001)
	•	The first and most prosaic value of a regime perspective is simply as a method of comparing cases to identify commonalities and differences in institutional risk profiles. (Hood et al., 2001)
	•	The second potential value of a regime perspective is as a means of bringing out the relationships among the different parts of a regulatory system. (Hood et al., 2001)
	•	A system perspective can also bring out what, in another context, Baldwin and Hawkins (1984: 582) have described as the toothpaste-tube-like characteristics of regulatory systems, that is, their tendency, if squeezed in one place, to bulge out in another. (Hood et al., 2001)
	•	What a ‘regime’ perspective does is to reconnect those elements and bring them together into a single analysis. (Hood et al., 2001)
	•	Third, a regime approach is a means of identifying puzzles and questions that are not easily visible from other approaches. (Hood et al., 2001)
	•	a risk regulation regime approach is not just a tool for analysis—a lens that comes between the microscope and the telescope—but also a challenge for explanation of observed variety. (Hood et al., 2001)
	•	To the extent that it is capable of bringing out clearly the variety of ways in which different forms of risk and hazard are regulated, the question of what accounts for that variety is inevitably raised. (Hood et al., 2001)
	•	the value of the regime approach does not lie only in its ability to produce more comprehensive comparative descriptions of the profile of state actions across different risk and hazard. It helps us to arrive at a more dimensional and disaggregated analysis of what happens when the risk society meets the regulatory state. (Hood et al., 2001)
	•	The fourth value of a regime approach is that it has potential policy significance in at least two ways. It highlights the consistency or otherwise with which risks and hazards are regulated in different policy domains, and the justification or rationalizations that are given for differences from one domain to another (see for example Breyer 1993). Such policy issues—increasingly preoccupying the courts, central agencies of government, and ‘risk bureaucracies’ themselves, as well as interest groups and the media—are at the heart of concerns about ‘better regulation’ in the UK and other OECD countries. (Hood et al., 2001)
	•	The other potential policy payoff of a regime approach is in the way it can be used to track the activity of regulation in each domain of risk and hazard across the various institutional boundaries and organizations active in the field. (Hood et al., 2001)

Risk assessment
	•	Risk assessment as currently practised can account for high-risk economic decisions in terms of the expectation of a probable high gain (Douglas, 2005:41)
	•	Risk assessments themselves are often 'complex counterfactuals about the distant future' which do not lend themselves to easy forms of public verification (Power, 2009)
	•	But as power has expanded and become more centralized, so have the consequences of decisions grown, making assessment even more important. As the risks increasingly came from technological activities, scientists and engineers replaced the shamans as advisors. (Perrow, 1999)
	•	risk assessments ignore the social class distribution of risk (Perrow, 1999)
	•	risk assessment is not as risky as the systems being assessed, but it has its unfortunate consequences for our society nevertheless (Perrow, 1999)
	•	The elusive and hard to manage qualities of today's hazards have forced the creation of a new intellectual discipline called risk assessment, designed to aid in identifying, characterizing, and quantifying risk (Slovic, 1987)
	•	Whereas technologically sophisticated analysts employ risk assessment to evaluate hazards, the majority of citizens rely on intuitive risk judgments, typically called "risk perceptions. Whereas technologically sophisticated analysts employ risk assessment to evaluate hazards, the majority of citizens rely on intuitive risk judgments, typically called "risk perceptions. For these people, experience with hazards tends to come from the news media, which rather thoroughly document mishaps and threats occurring throughout the world. (Slovic, 1987)
	•	Risk assessment has come to be seen as an essential component of regulatory and related types of decision-making […] (National Research Council (U.S.) et al., 2009)
	•	Risk assessment, we propose, should certainly continue to capture and accurately describe what various bodies of research findings do and do not tell us about various threats to human health and to the environment, but it should do so only after the questions that risk assessment is supposed to address have been posed, through careful evaluation of the options available to manage the environmental problem at hand, similar to what is done in ecologic risk assessment. (National Research Council (U.S.) et al., 2009)
	•	risk assessment is seen as a method for evaluating the relative merits of various options (or interventions) for managing risk. (National Research Council (U.S.) et al., 2009)
	•	Risk assessment, in that decision-making context, is an essential tool for understanding what public-health and environmental goals can be achieved or have been achieved by the actions taken. (National Research Council (U.S.) et al., 2009)
	•	[…] the goal of risk assessment is to describe the probability that adverse health or ecosystem effects of specific types will occur under specified conditions of exposure to an activity or an agent (chemical, biologic, radiologic, or physical), to describe the uncertainty in the probability estimate, and to describe how risk varies among populations. (National Research Council (U.S.) et al., 2009)
	•	risk assessment would consider the risks associated with existing conditions (that is, the probability of harm under the “take no action” alternative) and the risks that would remain if each of various possible actions were taken to alter the conditions. (National Research Council (U.S.) et al., 2009)
	•	The conduct of risk assessment in the broadest practicable risk-management context brings to light the fullest possible picture of net public-health and environmental benefits. (National Research Council (U.S.) et al., 2009)
	•	risk assessments may be semiquantitative. Similarly, descriptions of the uncertainties inherent in all risk assessments. Because risk assessments can vary in detail and complexity, it is important to know how a risk assessment will be used before it is undertaken so that it can be designed and carried out at the level of technical detail appropriate to the problem at hand. (National Research Council (U.S.) et al., 2009)
	•	It is important to understand the context in which a risk assessment will be used, so that the appropriate options for addressing a problem can be considered. (National Research Council (U.S.) et al., 2009)
	•	In any event, the utility of risk assessments may be less than ideal because of a failure to achieve clarity regarding the options for decision- making in advance of identifying the types of risk assessments that will be of value. (National Research Council (U.S.) et al., 2009)
	•	It is important for the advance of risk assessment to consider the types of scientific knowledge now available and their use for improving the quantitative characterization of variability. (National Research Council (U.S.) et al., 2009)
	•	risk assessment is subject to scientific, political, and public controversy. (National Research Council (U.S.) et al., 2009)
	•	risk assessment, which has science at its (National Research Council (U.S.) et al., 2009)
	•	Reliable and relevant scientific data are major determinants of the quality of any risk assessment (National Research Council (U.S.) et al., 2009)
	•	risk assessment has been used to describe the likelihood of a diverse number of unwanted events. These include industrial explosions, workplace injuries, failure of machine parts, a wide variety of natural catastrophes (e.g., earthquakes, tidal waves, hurricanes, volcanic eruptions, tornadoes, blizzards), injury or death due to an array of voluntary activities (e.g.; skiing, football, sky divine, flying, hunting), diseases (e.g., cancer, leukemia, developmental toxicity caused by chemical exposure), death due to natural causes (e.g., heart attack, cancer, diabetes), death due to lifestyle (e.g., smoking, alcoholism, diet), and a number of other endpoints (Schwing and Albers, 1980). (Paustenbach, 2002c)
	•	The purpose of risk assessments is to provide pertinent information to risk managers. specifically, policymakers and regulators, so that the best possible decisions can he made. (Paustenbach, 2002c)
	•	the goal of the assessment is to estimate the likelihood of an adverse effect on humans, wildlife, Orecological systems posed by a specific level of exposure to a chemical or physical hazard (Paustcnbach, 1989). (Paustenbach, 2002c)
	•	The term risk assessment has been misused by dozens of scientists whose studies have appeared in the scientific literature during the past 20 years. All too often, risk assessment has incorrectly been characterized as the process used to estimate the low-dose response following exposure to carcinogenic chemicals, often termed quantitative risk assessment. (Paustenbach, 2002c)
	•	Perhaps the best and most widely cited definition of risk assessment is the one suggested by the National Academy of Science (NAS. 1983). In its report. the NAS committee: Risk assessment to mean the characterization of the potential adverse health effects of human exposures to environmental hazards. Risk assessments include several elements: description of the potential adverse health effects based on an evaluation of results of epidemiologic, clinical, toxicologic, and environmental research; extrapolation from those results to predict the type and estimate the extent or health effects in humans under given conditions of exposure: judgments as to the number and characteristics of persons exposed at various intensities and durations: and summary judgments on the existence and overall magnitude of the public-health problem. Risk assessment also includes characterization of the uncertainties inherent M the process of inferring risk. (Paustenbach, 2002c)
	•	Risk assessment can be divided into four major steps: hazard identification. dose-response assessment, exposure assessment, and risk characterization. (Paustenbach, 2002c)
	•	The origins of risk assessment, in its most basic form, can be traced back to that of early humans. Certainly, after humans recognized that the meat of animals represented a source of food when edible plants were not available, they had to weigh the hazard of being mauled by a wild animal, which they hoped to kill and eat, versus the benefit of thwarting starvation. (Paustenbach, 2002c)
	•	The formal definition of risk assessment is: a systematic process for describing and quantifying the risks associated with hazardous substances, processes, action or events. (Covello and Merkhofer, 1993) (IEA Greenhouse Gas R&D Programme, 2009)
	•	Risk assessment is the process of identifying hazards and evaluating the risk of them. It includes estimates of uncertainty and is based on the scientific knowledge available. (IEA Greenhouse Gas R&D Programme, 2009)
	•	In a profound risk assessment framework, the following questions should be answered: What can go wrong that may lead to any hazardous impact (scenario analysis - qualitative risk assessment)? What would be the probability of this failure to happen (probability quantification - quantitative risk assessment)? If it happens, which consequences are expected (impact assessment - quantitative risk assessment)?
(IEA Greenhouse Gas R&D Programme, 2009)

	•	Many aspects of risk assessment are debatable, but he has faith in the objectivity that may be achieved by science, expertise, and careful deliberation. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	Risk assessment is quantitative in nature. (Wells, 1996)
	•	Risk assessment is increasingly being required for major hazard plants and this is discussed with respect to estimate relative and absolute value of risk. (Wells, 1996)

	•	Values are inherent in risk assessment. They influence, for example, the allocation of resources to studying specific risks or risks in general-and, thereby, produce the data needed to motivate action or quiet concerns. Values are also reflected in how risks are characterised (Fischhoff, 1995)
	•	the next era in the history of risk assessment will need to focus on improvements to risk characterization, including better communication of risk findings to decision makers and the public. (Williams and Paustenbach, 2002)
	•	whereas the technical assessment of risk is essential to decisions about competing designs or materials, it often fails to inform societal choices regarding technology. (Kasperson et al., 1988)

	•	Although risk assessments are more comprehensive to their very nature than hazard classi cations, they are not always pure scientific affairs. In cases when there are high levels of scientific uncertainty, expert judgements are often used, which in turn can at times be incorrect. (Lofstedt, 2011)

	•	Assessing risks involves identifying the hazards associated with the risk issue, ie what in a particular situation could cause harm or damage, and then assessing the likelihood that harm will actually be experienced by a specified population and what the consequences would be. (Great Britain and Health and Safety Executive, 2001)
	•	The process of assessing risks needs to take account of the possibility of uncertainty. For example the science underpinning the assessment may be complex, ambiguous or incomplete and/or the necessary data may not be available. (Great Britain and Health and Safety Executive, 2001)
	•	assessing risks is far from being a straightforward exercise. At times the risk assessment will be a simple process based on observation and judgement, while at the other extreme it can also require the use of complex techniques such as quantified risk assessment. In practice it cannot be carried out without adopting certain conventions or protocols. (Great Britain and Health and Safety Executive, 2001)
	•	it is the major task of risk assessment to identify and explore, preferably in quantitative terms, the types, intensities and likelihood of the normally undesired consequences related to risks. In addition, these consequences are associated with special concerns that individuals, social groups or different cultures may attribute to such risks. They also need to be assessed in order to make a prudent judgement about the toler- ability or acceptability of risks. (Renn, 2007a)
	•	a tool for gaining knowledge about risks (Renn, 2007a)

	•	The final product of risk assessment is an estimation of the risk in terms of a probability distribution of the modelled consequences (drawing on either discrete events or continuous loss functions). (Renn, 2007b)
	•	The different stages of risk assessment vary from risk source to risk source. (Renn, 2007b)
	•	there is agreement on basically three core components of risk assessment: 1 identification and, if possible, estimation of hazard; 2 assessment of exposure and/or vulnerability; and 3 estimation of risk, combining the likelihood and the severity of the targetedconsequences, based on the identified hazardous characteristics and the exposure/vulnerability assessment. (Renn, 2007b)

	•	One of the main challenges of risk assessment is the systematic characterization of these remaining uncertainties. They can partly be modelled by using inferential statistics (confidence interval) or other simulation methods (such as Monte Carlo), but often they can only be described in qualitative terms. (Renn, 2007b)
	•	There is no doubt that risk assessment methods have matured to become sophisticated and powerful tools in coping with the potential harm of human actions or natural events (Morgan, 1990). Its worldwide application in dealing and managing risks, however, largely fails to reflect this degree of power and professionalism. (Renn, 2007b)
	•	Risk assessment is confronted with three major challenges that can be best described using the terms ‘complexity’, ‘uncertainty’ and ‘ambiguity’. These three challenges are not related to the intrinsic characteristics of hazards or risks themselves but to the state and quality of knowledge available about both hazards and risks. (Renn, 2007b)
	•	Lofstedt describes risk assessment as based on the probability that a chemical substance will cause harm to humans or the environment when it is used. Hazard assessments, on the other hand, focus on the properties of a chemical. The question of this assessment is whether the chemical has the potential to cause an adverse or harmful effect.  (Jørgensen, 2011)
	•	Lofstedt does not take suf ciently into account that the main problem with risk assessments is the fact that in many cases the risks are not known. Of- ten reality is so complex – or the substances assessed are so new – that uncertainty is the general condi- tion. But risk assessments are based on the condition of certainty. It is assumed that the risk can be calculated in an exact way. Regretfully, this is far from always being the case. (Jørgensen, 2011)
	•	Thus risk assessments in many cases give false promises concerning our ability to calculate and control the risk. (Jørgensen, 2011)
	•	Risk assessments thus have a number of inbuilt  aws that should be taken into consideration in a discussion of risk vs. hazard assessments. (Jørgensen, 2011)
	•	Risk assessment has played a signi cant role in the development of environmental regulation in the United States since the early 1980’s during which time the country needed to prioritize the clean-up of thousands of contaminated sites. (Paustenbach and Panko, 2011)
	•	Only when the risk assessment methodology is transparent, can a regulator be con dent that their risk management decision will achieve what they desire with respect to protecting public health or the environment. (Paustenbach and Panko, 2011)
	•	The basis of risk assessment is the systematic use of analytical – largely probability-based – methods which have been constantly improved over the past years. (Renn, 2011)
	•	risk assessments specify what is at stake, assess uncertainties and calculate probabilities for (un)wanted consequences, to produce a risk picture. (Renn, 2011)
	•	Risk assessment is a management tool to determine whether, how and in what circumstances, harm might be caused. (Skinner, 2011)
	•	During the past several decades, the field of risk assessment has developed to impart rationality to the management of technological hazards. (Slovic, 1993)
	•	Risk assessment has its roots in epidemiology, toxicology, systems analysis, reliability theory, and many other disciplines. (Slovic, 1993)
	•	risk-assessment studies tend to increase perceived risk. (Slovic, 1993)
	•	Risk assessments are slow and resource intensive and should at times be abandoned for hazard classifications according to Schaible and Buonsante. (Lofstedt, 2014)
	•	A risk assessment is a combination of the likelihood and the severity of a substance, activity or process to cause harm (Nordlander et al. 2011; UK Royal Society 2002). (Lofstedt, 2014)
	•	risk assessment is a combination of the likelihood and the severity of a substance, activity or process to cause harm. (Aven, 2014) 
	•	risk assessments based on likelihood and probability judgments could conceal uncertainties and the potential for surprises (Aven 2013) – the uncertainty aspect (and hence the potentiality dimension) is not necessarily removed by performing a full risk assessment. (Aven, 2014)
	•	In a risk assessment, we may produce probabilities that the substances could cause harm, but the strength of the knowledge that they are based on could be strong or poor. (Aven, 2014)
	•	While risk assessment is more informative than simple hazard assessment, it is not sufficient for policy decisions. (Dudley, 2014)
	•	assessments of the risks posed under different conditions will always be uncertain. (Dudley, 2014)
	•	while risk assessment is essential for understanding the positive question of what is, or predicting what outcomes might derive under different scenarios, it is less helpful for the normative (policy) decisions regarding what should be. (Dudley, 2014)
	•	risk assessment, while necessary, is rarely sufficient for establishing effective policy to address identified risks. (Dudley, 2014)

	•	a risk assessment depends on available data, which means historical or experimental data. The collec- tion of existing data can be time-consuming, and if data are limited, contradictory, or simply unavailable, the risk assessment is difficult or even impossible to conduct. Furthermore, where such problems exist, the process of doing a risk assessment will be a lengthy one, as will the substitution process itself – something Löfstedt also stresses as a drawback of the substitution principle. (Olofsson, 2014)
	•	Risk assessment is the use of the factual base to define the health effects of exposure of individuals or populations to hazardous materials and situations. (National Research Council, 1983)
	•	Risk assessment draws extensively on science, and a strong scientific basis has developed for linking exposure to chemicals to chronic health effects. However, data may be incomplete, and there is often great uncertainty in estimates of the types, probability, and magnitude of health effects associated with a chemical agent, of the economic effects of a proposed regulatory action, and of the extent of current and possible future human exposures. (National Research Council, 1983)
	•	We use risk assessment to mean the characterization of the potential adverse health effects of human exposures to environmental hazards. (National Research Council, 1983)
	•	Risk assessments include several elements: description of the potential adverse health effects based on an evaluation of results of epidemiologic, clinical, toxicologic, and environmental research; extrapolation from those results to predict the type and estimate the extent of health effects in humans under given conditions of exposure; judgments as to the number and characteristics of persons exposed at various intensities and durations; and summary judgments on the existence and overall magnitude of the public-health problem. (National Research Council, 1983)
	•	Risk assessment also includes characterization of the uncertainties inherent in the process of inferring risk. (National Research Council, 1983)
	•	The term risk assessment is often given narrower and broader meanings than we have adopted here. (National Research Council, 1983)
	•	Risk assessment can be divided into four major steps: hazard identification, dose-response assessment, exposure assessment, and risk characterization. (National Research Council, 1983)
	•	A risk assessment might stop with the first step, hazard identification, if no adverse effect is found or if an agency elects to take regulatory action without further analysis, for reasons of policy or statutory mandate. (National Research Council, 1983)
	•	Risk assessment is only one aspect of the process of regulatory control of hazardous substances. (National Research Council, 1983)
	•	Risk assessment is an analytic process that is firmly based on scientific considerations, but it also requires judgments to be made when the available information is incomplete. These judgments inevitably draw on both scientific and policy considerations. (National Research Council, 1983)
	•	Risk assessment suffers from the current absence of a mechanism for addressing generic issues in isolation from specific risk management decisions. (National Research Council, 1983)
	•	Risk assessment activities should be strictly separated from the analysis of risk management options and selection of regulatory strategies. (National Research Council, 1983)
	•	Risk assessment activities should be centralized in a single body that serves all regulatory agencies. (National Research Council, 1983)
	•	The risk assessment function is performed entirely by Bureau scientists. (National Research Council, 1983)
	•	Risk assessment is corporatist insofar as political decision makers determine the extent to which risks should be "socialized" to those exposed to the risk or "internalized" by those generating the risk. (Matheny and Williams, 1984)
	•	risk assessment is in large part a political question (Matheny and Williams, 1984)
	•	Lowrance (1976) points out that risk assessment combines risk measurement (a technical issue) with the determination of the level of risk "acceptable" (a political issue). (Matheny and Williams, 1984)
	•	Risk assessment is now the basis for most important regulations concerning potentially hazardous substances. (Rodricks et al., 1987)
	•	risk assessment is the most powerful device available to organize and express what can be stated about risks that are not subject to direct observation and measurement, but which nevertheless may be of concern. (Rodricks et al., 1987)
	•	Traditional risk assessment is based on a number of esti- mates, including the measure of the chemical in the environment, assumptions regarding the movement of the chemical through a specific medium, the way in which the chemical is introduced into the body, and the degree and way in which the chemical impacts the body (MacGregor, Slovic, and Malmfors 1999). These estimates rest on scien- tific and technical considerations based on the biophysical sciences and applied mathematics (Dietz, Frey, and Rosa 2002; Kasperson et al. 1988; Rayner and Cantor 1987). (Brent K., 2004)
	•	In the risk assessment, the threats that have been developed in the thematic in-depth studies are measured against a yardstick based on a predefined model. (Bergmans et al., 2009)
	•	The risk assessment is suitable for an all hazard approach. (Bergmans et al., 2009)
	•	The risk assessment is then the basis for the analysis of the available capabilities and advice to the Cabinet about the capabilities to be reinforced, and therefore contains guidance for decision-making about the extra use of capabilities (in nature and scale) to tackle the threats analysed in the scenarios. (Bergmans et al., 2009)
	•	Appreciating and calculating the risks are parts of risk assessment. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Assess the risks: a. Appreciate the associated likelihood and return of each risk. b. Calculate the relative scale, level, or rank of the risks. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	[…] all a risk assessment needs to do, after a risk analysis, is: a. Appreciate the associated likelihood and return of each risk; b. Calculate the relative scale, level, or rank of the risks. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Risk assessment can be informal, subconscious, and routine. Some authors have pleaded for more insightful understanding rather than conventional wisdom or generalizable models. Molak writes, “The thought process that goes into evaluating a particular hazard is more important than the application of some sophisticated mathematical technique or formula, which often may be based on erroneous assumptions or moderls of the world” (1997, p. 8). According to Bracken, Bremmer, and Gordon, “Risk management is about insight, not numbers. It isn’t the predictions that matter most but the understanding and discovery of the dynamics of the problems” (2008, p. 6). (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Risk assessment is not just a formal step in a prescribed process but is something we do all the time. When you choose to walk across a street or enter a neighbourhood, you have assessed the risks – however unconsciously or imperfectly. That process is often termed dynamic risk assessment (Newsome, 2013)
	•	A risk assessment is a quantitative, qualitative, or hybrid assessment that seeks to determine the likelihood that an adversary will successfully exploit a vulnerability and the resulting impact (degree of consequence) to an asset. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	A risk assessment is the foundation for prioritizing risks in order to effectively implement countermeasures. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	No organization is without risk. The risk assessment and management process seeks to reduce risk to a tolerable level. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	The risk assessment is the culmination of the previous steps discussed thus far beginning with identifying assets, inventorying existing security measures, defining threats, and identifying vulnerabilities. The final step of the process is to calculate risks and make recommendations to reduce them to a level acceptable to the organization. (Vellani, 2007)

	•	Identifying assets is the first step. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	The second step of the risk assessment process is to inventory existing security measures designed to protect assets. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	The third step in the risk assessment process is the threat assessment, whereby threats are identified, characterized and rated on either a qualitative or quantitative scale. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	The fourth step of the risk assessment process is the vulnerability assessment wherein weaknesses in the security program are identified via the vulnerability assessment’s primary tool, the security survey. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	Risk assessment, including the cost-benefit analysis and report with recommendations, is the fifth and final step in the risk assessment process. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	Risk assessments are comprehensive and rational reviews that offer a logical and defensible method for security professionals to make decisions about secu- rity expenditures and to select cost-effective security measures that will protect critical assets and reduce risk to an acceptable level. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	Assessing risk is a dynamic process that involves continuous evaluation of assets, threats, and vulnerabilities. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	Risk assessments are typically a staged process whereby critical assets are identified, current countermeasures are enumerated, threats are identified, vulnerabilities are defined, and prioritized recommendations are made to protect critical assets based on probabilities of attack. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	Risk assessments can be both quantitative and qualitative, or a hybrid. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	While assessing risk is more art than science, the risk assessment methodology should be structured so that the results and recommendations can be replicable given a different assessment team. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	Risk assessments should generally be quantitative to the extent possible, recommendations for additional security measures should be the result of a cost-benefit analysis, and measures should be benchmarked against industry standards. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	A risk assessment performed at the company level is concerned with the overall risks to the company. (Landoll, 2011)
	•	A risk assessment performed at the activity level would encompass formalized or built-in risk assessments in individual control activities. (Landoll, 2011)
	•	The ISO 27001/2 de nes risk assessment as the “systematic consideration of the business harm likely to result from a security failure... and the realistic likelihood of such a failure occurring in the light of prevailing threats and vulnerabilities, and the controls currently implemented” (ISO, 2000). (Landoll, 2011)
	•	accurately describing the risk can be one of the hardest parts of any risk assessment. (Wheeler, 2011)
	•	Risk assessments are about more than running through checklists of controls and identifying gaps. Likewise, a risk assessment needs to have more substance than just a list of all the worst-case scenarios that you can imagine. (Wheeler, 2011)
	•	Today, risk assessment has become intensely individualized, related to the safety of the person, disaggregated in some cases from the society of which the citizen is still part. (Coker, 2009)
	•	Risk assessment, in short, was a question of mathematics irrespective of whether the risk was explicitly or implicitly calculated. As such, the risk calculus was part of an instrumental world, a realm that provided clear dis- tinctions between safety and danger, truth and falsity, past and future (Adams 2003:7). We could build in margins of safety, distinguish between real and hypothetical dangers and draw a line between the present and the future. (Coker, 2009)
	•	the general fact that a risk assessment cannot be used to make a deterministic forecast of events is oftenreferred to as ‘incertitude’. (Frühling, 2014)
	•	‘Risk assessment’ is used in the daily practice in many disciplines and it is often influenced by the personal risk acceptance. (Brauch, 2011)
	•	Risk assessment is a highly subjective process and individuals are prone to systematically misperceive risk (Hubbard 2009) and there is limited scienti c study to show if risk matrices improve risk making decisions (Cox 2008). (Pickering and Cowley, 2010)
	•	Risk assessment entails the evaluation of information on the hazardous properties of substances, on the extent of human exposure to them, and on the characterization of the resulting risk. (National Research Council (U.S.), 1994)
	•	Risk assessment is not a single, fixed method of analysis. Rather it is a systematic approach to organizing and analysing scientific knowledge and information for potentially hazardous actvivities or for substances that might pose risks under specified conditions. (National Research Council (U.S.), 1994)
	•	Even if the risks are assessed as tiny, improbable things do happen. (Omand, 2014)
	•	Yes, analysts and their agencies will attempt to "game" the numbers. Yes, policymakers will apply political pressure for analysts and agencies to alter their declared odds. All risk- assessment methods are corruptible. (Schrage, 2005)
	•	Risk assessment is the combinaison of the firt two steps – identifying hazards and analysing their potential effects. (Walick, 1994)
Risk assessors
	•	Risk assessors might be faced with several scientifically plausible approaches (for example, choosing the most reliable dose-response model for extrapolation beyond the range of observable effects) with no definitive basis for distinguishing among them. (National Research Council (U.S.) et al., 2009)
	•	In their roles as risk managers, those officials are responsible for using completed risk assessments with information from other disciplines to shape regulatory decisions. (National Research Council (U.S.) et al., 2009)
	•	The risk assessor. however, is expected to assemble all of the available information and to present a balanced view of what the data show and what might be done with that information. (Williams and Paustenbach, 2002)
	•	[…] the historical approach used by many risk assessors to present overly conservative or "worst-case-estimates of risk based on limited data will no longer be considered acceptable or necessarily in the best interests of society. (Williams and Paustenbach, 2002)
	•	hazard assessment and risk assessmentare not mutually exclusive. (Lofstedt, 2011)
	•	we use a risk assessment essentially as a tool to inform our decisions by assisting in our understanding of the nature and degree of risk and for extrapolating, from available data, our experience of harm, or for representing a large amount of scientific information and judgement as an estimate of the risks. (Great Britain and Health and Safety Executive, 2001)
	•	the risk assessment may show that the risks are such that individuals may not be unduly concerned because of the familiarity of the risks etc (see paragraph 79) and/or that the expectation of harm to any one individual is low. (Great Britain and Health and Safety Executive, 2001)
	•	Risk assessors have to make judgements about the level of complexity that they are able to process and about how to treat intervening variables (such as lifestyle, other environmental factors and psychosomatic impacts). (Renn, 2007b)
	•	A risk assessor, in the absence of a clear indication based on science, could choose a particular approach (e.g., the use of an extrapolation model) solely on the basis of the degree to which it is conservative, i.e., on the basis of its policy implications. (National Research Council, 1983)
	•	All this illustrates the obvious principle that the risk assessor should be diligent when choosing experts. This is not to say that we should doubt all experts but that we should be more discriminating than is typical. We should carefully select the minority of all experts, even at the best institutions, who are objective, evidence-based, practical interdisciplinary thinkers. (Newsome, 2013)
Risk assessment data
	•	William Ruckelshaus, appointed by President Nixon to serve as the first EPA administrator, diagnosed the problem: ‘‘Risk assessment data can be like a captured spy: if you torture it long enough, it will tell you anything you want to know.’’ (Michaels, 2008)
Risks assessment policy
	•	The term "risk assessment policy" has therefore been recommended to differentiate those judgments and choices from the broader social and economic policy issues that are inherent in risk management decisions (NRC. 1994). (Williams and Paustenbach, 2002)
	•	A full analysis should therefore include provisions for risk screening and the selection of different routes for risk assessment, concern assessment and risk management. (Renn, 2007b)
	•	It is meant to guide the assessment process in terms of assess- ment and management protocols, methods of investigation, statistical procedures and other scientific conventions used in assessing risks or selecting risk reduction options. A screening process may also be employed when characterizing risks according to complexity, uncertainty and ambiguity, as we will explain later. (Renn, 2007b)
Risk assessment communication
	•	Communication of risk assessments and information about your management of the risks is useful for external confidence and transparency and is a necessary vehicle in compliance with external reviews, monitors, and audits. (Newsome, 2013)
Risk assessment report
	•	The risk assessment report is a comprehensive written document that incor- porates all elements of the risk assessment methodology. Typical components of a full-scale risk assessment report include a listing of major assets, critical assets, and the facility characterization, a summary of existing security measures, the threat assessment report including supporting documentation with crime analysis charts and graphs, major elements of the vulnerability assessment report with the security survey included as an appendix, and recommendations for security modifications with the cost-benefit analysis. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	The goal of the report is to highlight the findings of the risk assessment so that those who hold the purse strings are able to make educated risk mitigation decisions that may include one or more of the five risk mitigation strategies (avoidance, reduction, spreading, transfer, and acceptance). (Vellani, 2007)

Quantified Risk Assessment 
	•	techniques have gradually been developed for assessing the probability and consequences of failures and otherevents that could lead to accidental releases from nuclear and other forms of plant. (Great Britain and Health and Safety Executive, 1992)
	•	Some risk domains are dominated by various forms of ‘quantified risk assessment’ culture, notably in nuclear power plant safety, in which risks are expressed in elaborate numbers but the costs and benefits of various forms of regulation or management are not. (Hood et al., 2001)
Statistical methods 
	•	Data are available to predictthe future performance of the activity or system analyzed. These methods can be based on data extrapolation or probabilistic modelling.
Systems analysis methods
	•	These methods are used to analyse systems where there is a lack of data to accurately predict the future performance of the system. Insights are obtained by decomposing the system into subsystems/components for which more information is available. Overall, probabili- ties and risk are a function of the system’s architecture.
	•	Systems analysis also includes tools such as scenarios, which show different. (Renn, 2011) plausible pathways from release of an agent to the  nal outcome (loss). Often such scenario analysis is based on extreme cases, such as “worst scenario” and “best scenario”. (Renn, 2011)
Cognitive assessments of risk
	•	Cognitive assessments of risk, on the other hand, tend to depend on more objective features of the risky situation, such as probabilities of outcomes and assessments of outcome severity. (Loewenstein et al., 2001)
	•	Even when feelings about risk are influenced by these objective features, the functional form of such dependence is different. For example, it has been demonstrated that feelings about risk are largely insensitive to changes in probability, whereas cognitive evaluations do take probability into account. (Loewenstein et al., 2001)
Risk-assessment process 
	•	risk-assessment process is given great attention by the National Research Council in Understanding Risk (NRC 1996, p. 6): The analytic-deliberative process leading to a risk characterization should include early and explicit attention to problem formulation; representation of the spectrum of interested and affected parties at this early stage is imperative. The analytic-deliberative process should be mutual and recursive. Analysis and deliberation are complementary and must be integrated throughout the process leading to risk characterization: deliberation frames analysis, analysis informs deliberation, and the process benefits from feedback between the two. (National Research Council (U.S.) et al., 2009)
	•	Each stage in the risk-assessment process calls for a series of choices, each with the potential to influence, and in some cases determine, the outcome of the risk assessment. (National Research Council (U.S.) et al., 2009)
	•	each stage of the risk-assessment process involves an initial survey of the scientific literature and relevant databases to identify and isolate studies pertinent to the pollutant or situation under review. The array includes information from many sources: reports in peer-reviewed journals, reports in the gray literature, personal communications about recent results not yet published, and the like. (National Research Council (U.S.) et al., 2009)
	•	paradoxes of the risk-assessment process is that the same scientific uncertainties that hamper and complicate risk assessment stimulate the development of new data and methods. (National Research Council (U.S.) et al., 2009)
	•	The risk assessment process has four parts: hazard identification. dose - response assessment, exposure assessment. and risk characterization. (Paustenbach, 2002a)
	•	
Probabilistic risk assessments 
	•	The processing of data is often guided by inferential statistics and organized in line with decision analytic procedures. These tools have been developed to generate knowledge about cause–effect relationships, estimate the strength of these relationships, characterize remaining uncertainties and ambiguities, and describe, in quanti- tative or qualitative form, other risk- or hazard-related properties that are important for risk management (IAEA, 1995; IEC, 1993). (Renn, 2007b)
	•	In general there are five methods for calculating probabilities: 1 Collection of statistical data relating to the performance of a risk source in the past (actuarial extrapolation). 2 Collection of statistical data relating to components of a hazardous agent or technology. This method requires a synthesis of probability judgements from component failure to system performance – probabilistic risk assess- ments (PRAs).3 Epidemiological or experimental studies which are aimed at finding statis- tically significant correlations between an exposure to a hazardous agent and an adverse effect in a defined population sample (probabilistic model- ling).4 Experts’ or decision-makers’ best estimates of probabilities, in particular for events where only insufficient statistical data is available (normally employing Bayesian statistical tools). Scenario techniques by which different plausible pathways from release of a harmful agent to the final loss are modelled on the basis of worst and best cases or estimated likelihood of each consequence at each knot. (Renn, 2007b)
	•	Probabilistic risk assessments for large tech- nological systems, for instance, include tools such as fault and event trees and Bayesian networks. The processing of data is often guided by inferential sta- tistics and organised in line with decision analytic procedures. These tools have been developed to generate knowledge about cause-effect relationships, express the strength of these relationships, characterize remaining uncertainties and ambiguities and describe, in quantitative or qualitative form, other risk or hazard related properties that are important for risk management. (Renn, 2011)
Hazard identification
	•	Hazard identification is the most easily recognized of the actions of regulatory agencies. It is defined here as the process of determining whether human exposure to an agent could cause an increase in the incidence of a health condition (cancer, birth defect, etc.) or whether exposure by a nonhuman receptor, for example, fish, birds, or other wildlife, might adversely be affected. It involves characterizing the nature and strength of the evidence of causation. Although the question of whether a substance causes cancer or other adverse (Paustenbach, 2002c)
	•	The hazard identification step in risk assessment contains a description of a particular chemical or physical agent's capacity to adversely affect, at some dose, the health of biota, fish. wildlife, or humans. It is defined as the process of determining whether exposure to an agent can cause an increased incidence of an adverse health effect (cancer, birth defect, etc.). It involves characterizing the nature and strength of the evidence of causation. (Paustenbach, 2002c)
	•	An important aspect of hazard identification and exposure assessment is a description of the pervasiveness of the hazard. (Paustenbach, 2002c)
	•	Hazard identification is the determination of whether a particular chemical is or is not causally linked to particular health effects [National Academy of Sciences (NAS), 1983]. (Paustenbach, 2002b)
	•	Of the four steps in a risk assessment, hazard identification is the most easily recognized in the actions of regulatory agencies. (Paustenbach, 2002b)
	•	It has been defined as the process of determining whether exposure to an agent can cause an increase in the incidence of adverse health effects (cancer, birth defect, etc.) (NAS, 1983). (Paustenbach, 2002b)
	•	The hazard identification portion of a risk assessment was intended to be the first chapter of a four-chapter analysis of a particular chemical. (Paustenbach, 2002b)
	•	The classic hazard identification where only one chemical is studied and all possible health effects are evaluated has generally been relegated to organizations that specialize in categorizing chemicals (e.g., carcinogen, neurotoxin) or those who identify safe levels of exposure [e.g., the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), the Occupational Safety and Hazard Administration (OSHA), and the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH)] (Paustenbach, 2002b)
	•	Epidemiological studies clearly provide the most relevant kind of information for hazard identification, simply because they involve observations of human beings, not laboratory animals (Paustenbach, 2002b)
	•	[…] when reference is made to hazard identification, it is –more often than not – the identification of hazardous characteristics and the risk which is of concern. (Wells, 1996)
	•	The primary uncertainty to consider in the hazard identification step is whether a specific chemical or agent is capable of causing in humans the same adverse health effects observed in animal studies. (Williams and Paustenbach, 2002)
	•	identification (establishing cause–effect link) and estimation (determining the strength of the cause–effect link) need to be performed for hazards and risks separately. (Renn, 2007b)

It involves characterizing the nature and strength of the evidence of causation. (National Research Council, 1983)
Exposure assessment
	•	Exposure assessment is the process of measuring or estimating the intensity, frequency, and duration of human or animal exposure to an agent currently present in the environment or of estimating hypothetical exposures that might arise from the release of new chemicals into the environment. (Paustenbach, 2002c)
	•	In its most complete form, an exposure assessment should describe the magnitude, duration, schedule, and route of exposure; the size, nature, and classes of the human, animal, aquatic, or wildlife populations exposed; and the uncertainties in all estimates. (Paustenbach, 2002c)
	•	The exposure assessment can often be used to identify feasible prospective control options and to predict the effects of available control technologies for controlling or limiting exposure. (Paustenbach, 2002c)
	•	Exposure assessment is the step that quantities the intake of an agent resulting from contact with various environmental media (e.g., air, water. soil. food). (Paustenbach, 2002a)
	•	Exposure assessments can address past. current, or future anticipated exposures. although uncertainties can become significant when attempting to anticipate what might have happened or what will happen. (Paustenbach, 2002a)
	•	Exposure assessment in various forms dates back at least to the early 20th century. and perhaps earlier, particularly in the fields of epidemiology,' industrial hygiene." and health physics. (Paustenbach, 2002a)
	•	Exposure assessment combines elements of all three disciplines and relies upon aspects of statistics. biochemical toxicology, large toxicology, atmospheric sciences, analytical chemistry. food sciences, physiology. environmental modeling, and others (Paustenbach, 2002a)
	•	an exposure assessment describes the nature and sin of the various populations exposed to a chemical agent and the magnitude and duration of their exposure (Paustenbach, 2002a)
	•	In most exposure assessments, chemical exposure is defined as contact of the chemical with some part of this boundary. (Paustenbach, 2002a)
	•	An exposure assessment is the quantitative or qualitative evaluation of that contact. It describes the intensity, frequency, and du- ration of contact, and often quantifies the rate at which the chemical crosses the boundary (chemical intake or uptake rates), the route of the chemical across the boundary [exposure route (e.g., dermal, oral, or respiratory)I, the resulting amount of chemical actually crossing the boundary (dose),  and the amount of chemical absorbed (internal dose) (Paustenbach, 2002a)
	•	Depending on the purpose of the exposure assessment. different estimates of exposure and dose may require calculation. Often. these choices will be made so that the dose metric will be the same as that used in the toxicology study. (Paustenbach, 2002a)
	•	Exposure assessment uses a wide array of information sources and techniques. Even when actual exposure-related measurements exist, assumptions or inferences will still be required. Most likely, data will not be available for all aspects of the exposure assessment and these data may be of questionable or unknown quality. In these situations, the exposure assessor will have to rely on a combination of professional judgment, inferences based on analogy with similar chemicals and conditions, estimation techniques, and the like. The net result is that the exposure assessment will be based on a number assumptions with varying degrees of uncertainty. (Paustenbach, 2002a)
	•	Exposure assessment is an iterative process. The search for an adequate and robust methodology to handle the problem at hand may proceed more effectively, and to a more certain conclusion, if the associated uncertainty is explicitly included and it can be used as a guide in the process of refinement. (Paustenbach, 2002a)
	•	To deal with the uncertainties (and variability) in exposure assessments, the use of Monte Carlo or other probabilistic techniques has increased substantially over the past decade (Morgan & Henrion. 1990: Thompson et al., 1992; Duan and Mage. 1997, Paustenbach, 2(100). (Williams and Paustenbach, 2002)
	•	The determination of the extent of human exposure before or after application of regulatory controls. (National Research Council, 1983)
	•	A dose-response assessment should describe and justify the methods of extrapolation used to predict incidence and should characterize the statistical and biologic uncertainties in these methods. (National Research Council, 1983)
	•	Exposure assessment is the process of measuring or estimating the intensity, frequency, and duration of human exposures to an agent currently present in the environment or of estimating hypothetical exposures that might arise from the release of new chemicals into the environment. (National Research Council, 1983)
	•	In its most complete form, it describes the magnitude, duration, schedule, and route of exposure; the size, nature, and classes of the human populations exposed; and the uncertainties in all estimates. (National Research Council, 1983)
	•	Exposure assessment is often used to identify feasible prospective control options and to predict the effects of available control technologies on exposure. (National Research Council, 1983)
	•	The first task of an exposure assessment is the determination of the concentration of the chemical to which humans are exposed. (National Research Council, 1983)
Dose-exposure assessment
	•	The determination of the relation between the magnitude of exposure and the probability of occurrence of the health effects in question. (National Research Council, 1983)
	•	Dose-response assessment is the process of characterizing the relation between the dose of an agent administered or received and the incidence of an adverse health effect in exposed populations and estimating the incidence of the effect as a function of human exposure to the agent. It takes account of intensity of exposure, age pattern of exposure, and possibly other variables that might affect response, such as sex, lifestyle, and other modifying factors. (National Research Council, 1983)
Integrated exposure
	•	Integrated exposure is the total "area under the curve' (AUC) of the exposure profile. (Paustenbach, 2002a)
Exposure profile
	•	An exposure profile picture of the exposure concentration over time) is particularly useful when trying to understand occupational exposure because it contains more information than an integrated exposure (a number), including the duration and periodicity of exposure, the peak exposure, and the shape of the area under the time concentration curve. Such profiles can allow toxicologists to identify those periods of time when risk might be the greatest (e.g., during certain periods of a pregnancy). (Paustenbach, 2002a)
	•	risks that seem negligible in a single exposure (e.g., bike riding, car driving, protected sex) can become major concerns through repeated exposure (Fischhoff, 2013)
Direct Measurement Approach
	•	The exposure can be measured at the point of contact of the outer boundary of the body) while it is taking place. measuring the exposure concentration and time of contact and integrating them (point-of-contact measurement). These assessments are based on direct measurement. (Paustenbach, 2002a)
	•	Point-of-contact or direct exposure assessment evaluates the exposure as it occurs. (Paustenbach, 2002a)
Exposure Scenario
	•	The exposure can be hypothetical, which is called an exposure scenario. In these assessments, specific data cannot actually be collected, but the relevant kinds of information can. For example, if an incinerator were built. it cannot be known today how much of each chemical in the airborne emissions would reach the various compartments in the environment (food, soil, sediment, surface water), but one can describe what is likely to occur (a scenario). (Paustenbach, 2002a)
	•	Using the exposure scenario approach, the assessor attempts to estimate or predict chemical concentrations in a medium or location and link this information with the time that individuals or populations are in contact with the chemical. An exposure scenario is the set of assumptions describing how this contact takes place. 
	•	This is. by far, the most common approach to exposure assessment, and such an approach is necessary when trying to predict the impact of events that may occur in the future, such as building a new manufacturing facility or introducing a new pesticide or herbicide. (Paustenbach, 2002a)
	•	The first step to building a scenario is to determine the concentration of the contaminated media. (Paustenbach, 2002a)
	•	estimate the contact time. identify who is likely to be ex- posed, and then develop estimates of the exposure frequency and duration. Like chemical concentration characterization, this is usually done indirectly using demographic data. survey statistics, behavior observation, activity diaries, activity models, or, in the absence of more substantive information, assumptions about behaviour  (Paustenbach, 2002a)
	•	Comprehensive exposure assessment of a complex scenario may require several hundred exposure factors to estimate the various chemical concentrations in one of several dozen different media. (Paustenbach, 2002a)
Exposure assessor
	•	The exposure assessor is likely to encounter several different types of measurements. (Paustenbach, 2002a)
	•	the assessor must be aware of the performance characteristics of the model and state how the exposure assessment requirements are satisfied by the model. (Paustenbach, 2002a)
	•	Exposure assessors have a responsibility to present not just numbers but also a clear and explicit explanation of the implications and limitations of their analyses. Uncertainty characterization helps to achieve this. (Paustenbach, 2002a)
Variability in exposure
	•	variability arises from true heterogeneity across people, places, or time (Paustenbach, 2002a)
	•	variability can affect the precision of the estimates and the degree to which they can be generalized. (Paustenbach, 2002a)
	•	Variability in exposure is related to an individual's location, activity, and behavior or preferences at a particular point in time, as well as pollutant emission rates and physical/chemical processes that affect concentrations in various media (e.g., air, soil, food, and water). (Paustenbach, 2002a)
	•	At a more fundamental level, three types of variability can be distinguished: Variability across locations (spatial variability); Variability over time (temporal variability);  Variability among individuals (interindividual variability) ). (Paustenbach, 2002a)
	•	Variability refers to true heterogeneity or diversity in a data set or population (NRC, 1994; EPA, 1997b). (Williams and Paustenbach, 2002)
Spatial variability 
	•	Spatial variability can occur both at regional (macroscale) and local (micro- scale) levels  (Paustenbach, 2002a)
Temporal variability
	•	Temporal variability refers to variations over lime, whether long or short term. Seasonal fluctuations in weather, pesticide applications, use of wood- burning appliances, and fraction of time spent outdoors arc examples of longer-term variability. (Paustenbach, 2002a)
Interindividual variability
	•	Interindividual variability can be either of two types: (I) human characteristics such as age or body weight and (2) human behaviors such as location and activity patterns. Each of these variabilities, in turn may be related to several underlying phenomena that vary. (Paustenbach, 2002a)
Highly exposed
	•	A “highly exposed" descriptor is useful when there is an identifiable subgroup in a population that is experiencing significantly greater exposure than the larger population (EPA, 1995c). (Williams and Paustenbach, 2002)
	•	A "highly susceptible" descriptor is useful when there is an identifiable sub- group in a population that is more sensitive or susceptible to the toxic effects of an agent than the larger population (EPA, 1995c). (Williams and Paustenbach, 2002)

Aggregate exposure
	•	Aggregate exposure is defined by EPA (1999c) as a "single chemical exposure via the dietary (oral route), drinking water (oral route) and residential (inhalation, dermal and/or oral route) pathways" (page I) . (Williams and Paustenbach, 2002)
	•	Aggregate exposure analysis therefore considers exposures from all relevant routes and sources for a single chemical, and aggregate risk is defined as "the likelihood of the occurrence of an adverse health effect resulting from all routes of exposure to a single substance" (page 41). (Williams and Paustenbach, 2002) 

Risk characterization
	•	Risk characterization is the process of estimating the incidence of a health effect under the various conditions of human or animal exposure described in the exposure assessment. It is performed by combining the exposure and dose response assessments. The summary effects of the uncertainties in the preceding steps should be described in this step. (Paustenbach, 2002c)
	•	[…] risk characterization to describe the fourth and final step of the risk-assessment process, in which there is an integration and synthesis of the information and analysis contained in the first three steps. (National Research Council (U.S.) et al., 2009)
	•	The committee stated that the term characterization was chosen to convey the idea that both quantitative and qualitative elements of the risk analysis, and of the scientific uncertainties in it, should be fully captured for the risk manager. (National Research Council (U.S.) et al., 2009)
	•	The quantitative estimate of the risk, the size of the exposed population. and the uncertainty surrounding the risk estimates (e.g., the risk characterization) are the topics of principal interest to the regulatory agency or risk manager in arriving at decisions. (Paustenbach, 2002c)
	•	In general, efforts to improve the risk characterization process have received the least amount of study to date compared with the other three steps in risk assessment. (Paustenbach, 2002c)
	•	Certainly, factors such as societal pressure, technical uncertainties, the cost benefit relationship, the cost effectiveness relationship, and severity of the potential hazard influence how decision makers respond to the risk assessment. However, better risk characterizations could be developed in risk assessments than have typically been the case. The result of these improvements is that risk managers can make more informed decisions. (Paustenbach, 2002c)
	•	Risk characterization represents the final, and perhaps the most important, step in the risk assessment process. In this step, data on the dose-response relation- ship of an agent are integrated with estimates of the degree of exposure in a population to characterize the likelihood and severity of health risk [Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 1995a]. (Williams and Paustenbach, 2002)
	•	Risk characterizations include both quantitative estimates and qualitative descriptors of risk, as well as discussions about key model assumptions and data uncertainties. 
	•	The most relevant findings and conclusions about risk are summarized in the risk characterization. which in turn is used to inform risk managers and decision makers [National Research Council (NRC). 1996]. (Williams and Paustenbach, 2002)
	•	the risk characterization process at- tempts to make sense of the available data and describe what it means to a broader audience. (Williams and Paustenbach, 2002)
	•	The primary reason for the lack of quality in risk characterizations is that unlike the other three portions of a risk assessment (hazard identification. exposure assessment, and dose response analysis), it is not possible to rely exclusively on guidance documents and formulas to properly capture the importance of the analysis. (Williams and Paustenbach, 2002)
	•	Perhaps the simile most important shortcoming of historical risk assessments has been the level of. often unjustified, confidence or certainty implied within the analysis or the risk characterization. (Williams and Paustenbach, 2002)
	•	risk characterizations should contain several types of information. Specifically, the key parameters used in the exposure assessment should be identified and discussed: this includes chemical concentrations at each exposure point, human intake of each chemical on a body-weight basis. route of chemical entry, uptake or absorption for each chemical. and the frequency and duration of exposure (EPA. 1989a). (Williams and Paustenbach, 2002)
	•	Risk characterizations should also present what is known (and unknown) about the toxicity of each chemical and discuss how the hazard potential may differ based on exposure route, health effect. dose—response model, and intra- or interspecies variability (EPA, I995b). (Williams and Paustenbach, 2002)
	•	all risk characterizations should include a section that discusses data, model, and statistical uncertainties and expresses the level of confidence in exposure and toxicity estimates (EPA, 1989a). (Williams and Paustenbach, 2002)
	•	Depending on the purpose, risk characterizations may also contain information on the effectiveness of alternative risk management options or the risk of competing or substitute chemicals (NRC, 1996; NRC, 1989; EPA, 1995c; Graham and Hartwell. 1997). (Williams and Paustenbach, 2002)
	•	risk characterization is broadly defined as "the estimate of the magnitude of the public-health problem" p. 28. The report also defined it as -the description of the nature and often the magnitude of human risk, including the attendant uncertainty" (page 3). (Williams and Paustenbach, 2002)
	•	risk characterizations reflect a combination of the exposure and dose-response assessments and serve as the intermediary between risk assessment and risk management. (Williams and Paustenbach, 2002)
	•	The Red Book also specifies that risk characterizations should summarize the key uncertainties in each step of the risk assessment process, particularly those related to statistical and biological uncertainty and the choice of assessment and exposed population. (Williams and Paustenbach, 2002)
	•	The following, more specific, definition was also provided by NRC (1983): Risk characterization is the process of estimating the incidence of a health effect under the various conditions of human exposure described in exposure assessment. I t k performed by combining the exposure and dose -response assessments. The summary effects of the uncertainties in the preceding steps are described in this step (page 20). Risk characterization, the estimate or the magnitude of the public-health problem, involves no additional scientific knowledge or concepts. However. the exercise of judgment in the aggregation of population groups with varied sensitivity and different exposure may affect the estimate (page 28). (Williams and Paustenbach, 2002)
	•	Risk characterizations were deemed to be a "key step in the ultimate site decision-making process" and such characterizations were not considered to be complete unless "numerical expressions of risk are accompanied by explanatory text interpreting and qualifying the results" (page 8-1). (Williams and Paustenbach, 2002)
	•	With regard to risk characterization, the memorandum stated that "numerical risk estimates should always be accompanied by descriptive information carefully selected to ensure an objective and balanced characterization of risk in risk assessment reports and regulatory document" (page 2). and risk evaluations should include a "statement of confidence in the assessment that identifies all major uncertainties along with comment on their influence on the assessment" (page 5). (Williams and Paustenbach, 2002)
	•	risk characterizations should clearly highlight both the confidence and uncertainty in the risk assessment, and that numerical risk estimates should always be accompanied by descriptive and balanced risk information. (Williams and Paustenbach, 2002)
	•	risk characterization was defined as the interface between risk assessment and risk management, that "integrates information from the preceding components of the risk assessment and synthesizes an overall conclusion about risk that is complete, informative and useful for decisionmakers" (page 3). (Williams and Paustenbach, 2002)
	•	risk characterizations should be more than a mere summarization of scientific information. (Williams and Paustenbach, 2002)
	•	risk characterizations are defined as an integral part of the entire process of risk decision making that is decision driven, recognizes all significant concerns. and reflects both analysis and deliberation by all interested parties. (Williams and Paustenbach, 2002)
	•	framework for risk characterizations, in which such characterizations not only describe a potentially hazardous situation, but also enhance practical understanding and illuminate practical choices (see Figure 5.2). (Williams and Paustenbach, 2002)
	•	The following conveys the "new" definition of risk characterization presented by NRC (1996): Risk characterization is a synthesis and summary of information about a poten- tially hazardous situation that addresses the needs and interests of decision makers and of interested and affected parties. Risk characterization is a prelude to decision making and depends on an iterative. analytic-deliberative process. i f the underlying process is unsatisfactory to some or all of the interested and affected parties, the risk characterization will he unsatisfactory as well. A risk characterization can only be as good as the analytic-deliberative process that produces it (page 27). (Williams and Paustenbach, 2002) 
	•	The evolving nature of risk characterizations suggests that future efforts to characterize human health risks will be held to a much higher standard than in the past. (Williams and Paustenbach, 2002)
	•	[…] risk characterizations are expected to provide a much more detailed discussion of key data uncertainties, as well as a description of the range or distribution of plausible risk estimates in a specified population (Paustenbach 1995; NRC. 1996). (Williams and Paustenbach, 2002)
	•	Risk characterizations are also expected to provide a fuller discussion of the underlying problem, and in the future, could require more reporting on the costs and benefits of alternate solutions, instead of merely reporting the results of the exposure and dose response assessment. (Williams and Paustenbach, 2002)
	•	risk characterization portion of future risk assessments is going to require a significant amount of transparency arid thoughtful discussion about the strengths and weakness of the analysis. (Williams and Paustenbach, 2002)
	•	The most recent guidance provided by N R C (1996) provides an example of how risk characterizations may evolve in the future (page 16): We have concluded that the view of risk characterization as a summary is seriously deficient, and we propose a more robust construction . . . If a risk characterization is to fulfill its purpose. it must (1) he decision driven, (2) recognize all significant concerns. (3) reflect both analysis and deliberation, with appropriate input form the interested and affected parties, and (4) be appropriate to the decision. (Williams and Paustenbach, 2002)
	•	An important feature of risk characterizations is that they summarize the key findings, assumptions, and/or limitations of the risk assessment. Although the individual components o f a risk assessment (hazard identification, dose - response relationship, and exposure assessment) will contain more detailed information about a chemical or agent, the risk characterization should attempt to reiterate the most important issues and interpret this information for a broader audience. (Williams and Paustenbach, 2002)
	•	risk characterizations would be most effective if they summarized what is known about a chemical's capacity for causing adverse health effects in humans, the key exposure parameters used in the risk assessment, toxicity data related to each chemical of interest, data variability and uncertainty, the level of confidence in exposure and toxicity estimates, and any other risk-related information that might be useful to a decision maker. (Williams and Paustenbach, 2002)
	•	it is for risk characterizations to "dig deeper" into the underlying data, and to present data uncertainties and alternative ways of evaluating the biological underpinnings of the hazard identification. (Williams and Paustenbach, 2002)
	•	In essence, characterizing risks require information on the principal pathways. magnitude of human exposure. and the number of likely to be exposed in a population (see Table 5.2). (Williams and Paustenbach, 2002)
	•	Given the significant impact that different exposure parameters can have on final risk estimates, it is essential that risk characterizations provide a dear description of, and rationale for, all exposure assumptions, including how persons are exposed, the exposed population, including sensitise populations), and the exposure frequency and duration. (Williams and Paustenbach, 2002)
	•	Risk characterizations need to summarize what is known about the toxicity of each chemical. but more importantly, highlight the. areas of toxicological uncertainty (EPA.  1989a). (Williams and Paustenbach, 2002)
	•	Ultimately, for the risk characterization to serve as a vehicle for informing risk managers, it should present the other side of the story- if there is substantial legitimate disagreement among the various datasets and experts. (Williams and Paustenbach, 2002)
	•	dose response assessments and characterizations should be balanced and address conflicting analyses of equal credibility, and to the extent possible, present a weight-of-evidence discussion about why one approach is superior to another. (Williams and Paustenbach, 2002)
	•	Risk characterizations are typically influenced by both the variability and uncertainty in the exposure and dose response assessments. (Williams and Paustenbach, 2002)
	•	There are many types of uncertainty in risk characterizations (see Table 5.4). General headings include "parameter uncertainty" (measurement errors, sampling errors, systematic errors) and -model uncertainty" (uncertainty due to necessary simplifications of real-world processes, misspecification of the model structure, model misuse, use of inappropriate surrogate variables) (Frey, 1992; EPA, 1997b). Another type of uncertainty -"scenario uncertainty- (descriptive errors. aggregation errors, errors in professional judgment. incomplete analysis), has also been reported in the literature (EPA, 1997b). (Williams and Paustenbach, 2002)
	•	The key sources of variability and uncertainty in an assessment need to be clearly highlighted in the risk characterization, including a discussion of the relative importance of each of these (Williams and Paustenbach, 2002)
	•	Although such qualitative descriptions can illuminate important caveats and convey the appropriate level of confidence in risk characterizations, the actual quantification of risk will ultimately have the strongest impact on decision-makers (Williams and Paustenbach, 2002)
	•	Depending on the purpose, risk characterizations may contain information on a wide variety of outcomes or consequences. (Williams and Paustenbach, 2002)
	•	The results of a risk characterization are often generated by comparing exposure data to pre-established toxicity criteria to evaluate the potential for ad- verse effects to occur in a specified population. (Williams and Paustenbach, 2002)
	•	most risk characterizations do not report lower-bound risk estimates (at doses where the upper-bound risk is significant) and many fail to acknowledge that the risk may in fact be zero. (Williams and Paustenbach, 2002)
	•	Risk characterizations may also be based cm average or high-end exposures in a population. and may refer to the general population or a more highly exposed or susceptible population subgroup (EPA, 1995c). (Williams and Paustenbach, 2002)
	•	Risk characterization involves integrating information from the first three steps of the risk assessment process -hazard identification. dose response assessment and exposure assessment --to derive conclusions about human risk. (Williams and Paustenbach, 2002)
	•	the use of Monte Carlo and other techniques will undoubtedly increase in future risk characterization, and regulatory agencies have already begun to publish guiding principles on how to conduct and interpret such analyses (EPA, 1997h). (Williams and Paustenbach, 2002)
	•	The uncertainties associated with risk characterization are generally the result of the combined uncertainties in the site conditions, exposure assumptions, and toxicity criteria (Williams and Paustenbach, 2002)
	•	One source of uncertainty that is unique to risk characterization, however, is the assumption that the total risk associated with exposure to multiple chemicals is equal to the sum of the individual risks for each chemical (i.e., the risks are additive) (Williams and Paustenbach, 2002)
	•	many risk characterizations intentionally over-estimate or attempt to generate the "worst case- estimate of risk in order to provide a preliminary screening level analysis. (Williams and Paustenbach, 2002) 
	•	Risk characterization serves as the interface between risk assessment and risk management, and hence, is instrumental in conveying the magnitude of a problem and highlighting priority risk areas. (Williams and Paustenbach, 2002)
	•	[…] characterizations of risk are also important because they allow risk comparisons to be made more accurately, across diverse compounds and settings. and help ensure that risk management actions are targeted appropriately. (Williams and Paustenbach, 2002) 
	•	risk characterizations should remain separate from risk management considerations (Williams and Paustenbach, 2002)
	•	[…] risk characterizations appear to differ somewhat between the U.S. and some other developed countries. In the U.S., there is a clear desire to keep the risk assessment and risk management processes separate from one another, while some other countries have elected to allow greater intermingling between these processes. It is likely that risk characterizations will continue to evolve worldwide, with perhaps a more uniform approach being adopted. (Williams and Paustenbach, 2002)

	•	Characterization also includes an analysis of the concerns associated with different outcomes and the likely secondary implications. It will be helpful for risk managers to receive best expert advice on potentially effective risk reduction measures and other management options that may lead to satisfactory results. (Renn, 2007b)
	•	Risk characterization includes tasks such as point esti- mates of risks, descriptions of remaining uncertainties (as undertaken for instance in climate change models or risk studies on endocrine disruptors) and potential outcome scenarios including the social and economic implica- tions, suggestions for safety factors to include inter-target variation, assurance of compatibility with legal prescriptions, risk–risk comparisons, risk–risk trade-offs, identification of discrepancies between risk assessment and risk perceptions as well as of potential equity violations, and suggestions for reasonable standards to meet legal requirements (Stern and Fineberg, 1996).

	•	Risk characterization, the estimate of the magnitude of the public-health problem, involves no additional scientific knowledge or concepts. (National Research Council, 1983)
	•	The term "risk characterization" embraced essential descriptive information about the nature of the adverse effects, the strength and consistency of the evidence, the severity and reversibility of the effects, and the steps that agencies or people could take to avoid or ameliorate the risks. (Omenn, 2003)
	•	In the case of complex risks, however, assessment and evaluation are often combined in one integrated process of ‘risk characterization’, which combines analysis and deliberation: Analysis uses rigorous, replicable methods developed by experts to arrive at answers to factual questions. Deliberation uses processes such as discussion, reflection, and persuasion to communicate, raise and collectively consider issues, increase understanding, and arrive at substantive decisions. Deliberationframes analysis and analysis informs deliberation. Thus, risk characterization is the output of a recursive process, not a linear one. Analysis brings new information into the process; deliberation brings new insights, questions, and problem formulations; and thetwo build on each other.. (Frühling, 2014)
	•	The purpose of risk characterization is ultimately to makean informed choice between different options to reducerisks, or doing nothing. (Frühling, 2014)
	•	Risk characterization combines description and professional advice about international developments, and the about the feasibility of the use of force, with value-based prioritization based on political judgement. (Frühling, 2014)

Level of confidence in a risk characterization
	•	The level of confidence in a risk characterization will depend, in part, on the nature and magnitude of the uncertainties in the assessment. (Williams and Paustenbach, 2002)
Minimal risk levels
	•	minimal risk levels (MRLs) that specify health guidance or acceptable exposure levels  (Williams and Paustenbach, 2002)
	•	MRLs are defined as an "estimate of the daily human exposure to a hazardous substance that is likely to be without appreciable risk of adverse noncancer health effects over a specified duration of exposure" (page 1). (Williams and Paustenbach, 2002)
	•	MRLs are based on noncancer health effects and the NOAEL/uncertainty factor approach. (Williams and Paustenbach, 2002)
	•	MRLs are also developed separately for oral and inhalation routes of exposure. (Williams and Paustenbach, 2002)
	•	MRLs are derived for acute (Ito 14 days), intermediate (I5 to 364 days), and chronic (365 days and longer) exposure durations versus the lifetime duration assumed by EPA. (Williams and Paustenbach, 2002)
	•	MRLs are also based on the most sensitive substance-- induced endpoint considered to be of relevance to humans, which may be less severe than those considered under the EPA approach. (Williams and Paustenbach, 2002)
	•	MRLs are not intended to define cleanup goals or action levels. (Williams and Paustenbach, 2002)
Maximum contaminant levels 
	•	maximum contaminant levels (MCLs) are enforceable and are defined as t h e maximum permissible level of a contaminant in water delivered to users of a public water system— (page 4). (Williams and Paustenbach, 2002)
Qualitative risk assessment
	•	Qualitative risk assessment constitutes of hazard identification, analysis and prevention. The hazards involved are site-specific events leading to undesirable consequences. A qualitative approach can be adopted for addressing well bore issues. Such methodology is aimed at the identification of hazards that could occur during injection operations as well as in the post-injection period. (IEA Greenhouse Gas R&D Programme, 2009)
	•	Risk assessments are comprehensive and rational reviews that offer a logical and defensible method for security professionals to make decisions about security expenditures and to select cost-effective security measures that will protect critical assets and reduce risk to an acceptable level. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	Assessing risk is a dynamic process that involves continuous evaluation of assets, threats, and vulnerabilities. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	Risk assessments are typically a staged process whereby critical assets are identified, current countermeasures are enumerated, threats are identified, vulnerabilities are defined, and prioritized recommendations are made to protect critical assets based on probabilities of attack. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	Qualitative assessments are based on the data available and on the skills of the assessment team, while quantitative assessments utilize numeric data to evaluate risk. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	Qualitative assessments are normally used when the assets in need of protection are of lower value or when data is not available. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	Qualitative risk assessments may also be used when insufficient historical information or metric data exists, precluding a quantitative approach. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	The results of qualitative assessments depend on the assessment skills of the people involved in the assessment. Risk levels are normally given in abstract values such as high, medium, or low, or color coded like the Homeland Security Advisory System. (Vellani, 2007)
Quantitative risk assessment
	•	quantitatively assess them, predicting the performance of critical parameters over a specified time frame. (IEA Greenhouse Gas R&D Programme, 2009)
	•	Quantitative risk assessment possesses deterministic and probabilistic elements. (IEA Greenhouse Gas R&D Programme, 2009)
	•	The goal of achieving accurate, highly quantitative estimates of risk, however, is hampered by limitations in scientific understanding and the availability of relevant data, which can be overcome only by the advance of relevant research. (National Research Council (U.S.) et al., 2009) 
	•	QRA is a powerful tool in showing the relationship between different subsystems and the dependencies within the overall system. (Great Britain and Health and Safety Executive, 2001)
	•	QRA is frequently used to estimate the risk from plant, as designed and operated. (Great Britain and Health and Safety Executive, 2001)
	•	The process of undertaking a QRA can lead to a better understanding of the important features contributing to risk and weaknesses in the systems as well as allowing a numerical estimate of the residual risk to be derived. (Great Britain and Health and Safety Executive, 2001)
	•	The quality of the modelling and the data will affect the robustness of the numerical estimate, and the uncertainties in it must always be borne in mind when using the estimate in risk management decisions. (Great Britain and Health and Safety Executive, 2001)
	•	The use of numerical estimates of risk by themselves can, for several reasons including those above, be misleading and lead to decisions which do not meet adequate levels of safety. (Great Britain and Health and Safety Executive, 2001)
	•	In general, qualitative learning and numerical risk estimates from QRA should be combined with other information from engineering and operational analyses in making an overall decision. (Great Britain and Health and Safety Executive, 2001)
	•	where major investments in health and safety are being made, or formal safety cases are being considered, it is likely that decision-making will depend more on rigorous quantified risk assessment (QRA). (Bandle, 2007)
	•	Quantitative assessments, on the other hand, are metric based and assign numeric values to the risk level. Overall risk levels are derived from all available security metrics. In physical protection systems, for example, the metrics used in determining the risk level include the threat level, probability of detection, delay times, and response force times. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	Quantitative assessments are commonly used for the protection of business critical or high-value assets. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	The general methodology for quantitative risk assessment is to consider the probability of an attack and the expected impact on each critical asset. The probability of attack is based on the adversary’s motivation, capability, and intent. Depending on the type of facility or assets being protected, historical data may also be considered, but a lack of history should not be indicative of a low or nonexistent threat level. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	Quantitative risk Assessments (QRA) have been the subject of a deal of academic criticism. For instance, the mathematical basis of the QRAs is disputed, especially where there are small numbers involved or where there are no reliable data to work from (Cohen, 1996; Toft, 1996). The interpretation of the data may prove difficult in a variety of ways. (Hutter, 2005)
Health risk assessment 
	•	Health risk assessment is the process wherein toxicology data from animal studies and human epidemiology arc evaluated, a mathematical formula is applied to predict the response at low doses, and then information about the degree of exposure is used to predict quantitatively the likelihood that a particular adverse response will be seen in a specific human population (Paustenbach, 2002a)
Hybrid risk assessments
	•	Hybrid risk assessments utilize quantitative data where available and qualitative where metrics are not readily available or insufficient. (Vellani, 2007)
Information risk assessment
	•	The biggest danger of informal assessments of risk is that they can all too easily – even unconsciously – be made consonant with policy-makers’ needs. (Ned Lebow, 2007)

Risk governance
	•	risk governance, understood as designs for the management of risk management (Power, 2009)
	•	Risk as a mode of governmentality reveals itself, in the managerial form of standards and guidance, as a continuation of control via the indirect technology of self-audit. This mode of control relies on evidence and proof of conformity to due risk management process. The production of this proof in the form of auditable trails of process documentation is more significant than any external inspection. (Bouder et al., 2007)
	•	‘government of risk’ is by no means uniform across problems and functions, with public perceptions, moral frameworks, institutional arrangements and the nature of the risk itself giving rise to variation in ‘risk regulation regimes’ (Power, 2004)
	•	The concept of risk governance comprises a broad picture of risk: not only does it include what has been termed ‘risk management’ or ‘risk analysis’, it also looks at how risk-related decision-making unfolds when a range of actors are involved, requiring coordination and possibly reconciliation between a profusion of roles, perspectives, goals and activities. {Citation}
	•	‘Risk governance’ involves the ‘translation’ of the substance and core prin- ciples of governance to the context of risk and risk-related decision-making. It includes the totality of actors, rules, conventions, processes and mechanisms concerned with how relevant risk information is collected, analysed and communicated and management decisions are taken. (Renn, 2007a)
	•	Encompassing the combined risk-relevant decisions and actions of both governmental and private actors, risk governance is of particular importance in, but not restricted to, situations where there is no single authority to take a binding risk-management decision but where, instead, the nature of the risk requires the collaboration of, and coordination between, a range of different stakeholders. (Renn, 2007a)
	•	Risk governance not only includes a multifaceted, multi-actor risk process, however; it also calls for the consideration of contextual factors such as institutional arrangements (for example the regulatory and legal framework that determines the relationship, roles and responsibilities of the actors and coordination mechanisms such as markets, incentives or self-imposed norms) and political culture, including different perceptions of risk. (Renn, 2007a)
	•	When looking at risk governance structures there is no possibility of including all the variables that may influence the decision-making process: there are simply too many. (Renn, 2007a)
	•	Risk governance is “the identification, assessment, management and communication of risks in a broad context. It includes the totality of actors, rules, conventions, processes and mechanisms and is concerned with how relevant risk information is collected, analysed and communicated, and how management decisions are taken. It applies the principles of good governance that include transparency, effectiveness and efficiency, accountability, strategic focus, sustainability, equity and fairness, respect for the rule of law and the need for the chosen solution to be politically and legally feasible as well as ethically and publicly acceptable” (International Risk Governance Council, 2008, p. 4). (Newsome, 2013)
Risk governance framework
	•	The risk governance framework offers two major innovations to the field of risk: the inclusion of the societal context and a new categorization of risk- related knowledge. (Renn, 2007a)
	•	The framework is inspired by the conviction that both the ‘factual’ and the ‘socio-cultural’ dimension of risk need to be considered if risk governance is to produce adequate decisions and results. While the factual dimension comprises physically measurable outcomes and discusses risk in terms of a combination of potential consequences – both positive and negative – and the probability of their occurrence, the socio-cultural dimension emphasizes how a particular risk is viewed when values and emotions come into play. (Renn, 2007a)
	•	The inclusiveness of the governance process: regarded as a necessary (although not in itself sufficient) prerequisite for tackling risks in both a sustainable and acceptable manner, it consequently imposes an obligation to ensure the early and meaningful involvement of all stakeholders, civil society in particular. (Renn, 2007a)
	•	The framework implements the principles of good governance: beyond the crucial commitment to participation these principles include transparency, effectiveness and efficiency, accountability, strategic focus, sustainability, equity and fairness, respect for the rule of law, and the need for the chosen solution to be politically and legally realizable as well as ethically and publicly acceptable. (Renn, 2007a)
	•	It breaks down into three main phases: ‘pre-assessment’, ‘appraisal’ and ‘management’. A further phase, comprising the ‘characterization’ and ‘evalua- tion’ of risk, is placed between the appraisal and management phases and can be assigned to either those charged with the assessment or those responsible for management, depending on who are better equipped to perform the associated tasks, thus concluding the appraisal phase or marking the start of the management phase. (Renn, 2007a)
	•	The risk process has ‘communication’ as a companion to all phases of addressing and handling risk and is itself of a cyclical nature. However, the clear sequence of phases and steps offered by this process is primarily a logical and functional one and will not always correspond to reality. (Renn, 2007a)
	•	risk governance processes, information about risks is pre- screened and then allocated to different assessment and management routes. (Renn, 2007b)
Pre-assessment phase
	•	The purpose of the pre-assessment phase is to capture both the variety of issues that stakeholders and society may associate with a certain risk and exist- ing indicators, routines and conventions that may prematurely narrow down, or act as a filter for, what is going to be addressed as risk. What counts as a risk may be different for different groups of actors. (Renn, 2007a)
	•	The first step of pre-assessment – risk framing – therefore places particular importance on the need for all interested parties to share a common understanding of the risk issues being addressed or raising awareness among those parties of the differences in what is perceived as a risk. For a common understanding to be achieved, actors need both to agree with the underlying goal of the activity or event generating the risk and be willing to accept the risk’s foreseeable implications for that very goal. (Renn, 2007a)
	•	A second step of the pre-assessment phase – early warning and monitoring – establishes whether signals of the risk exist that might indicate its realization. This step also investigates the institutional means in place for moni- toring the environment for such early-warning signals. (Renn, 2007a)
	•	The third step – pre-screening – takes up and looks into the widespread practice of conducting preliminary probes into hazards or risks and, based on prioritization schemes and existing models for dealing with risk, of assigning a risk to pre-defined assessment and management ‘routes’. (Renn, 2007a)
	•	The fourth and final step of pre-assessment selects major assumptions, conventions and procedural rules for assessing both the risk and the emotions associated with it. (Renn, 2007a)
	•	Another major component of pre-assessment is the selection of conventions and procedural rules needed for a comprehensive scientific appraisal of the risk, in other words for assessing the risk and the concerns related to it (see below). Any such assessment is based on prior informed yet subjective judgements or conventions articulated by the scientific community or a joint body of risk assessors and managers. (Renn, 2007b)
	•	The title ‘pre-assessment’ does not mean that these steps are always taken before assessments are performed. (Renn, 2007b)
Risk appraisal
	•	The objective of the risk appraisal phase is to provide the knowledge base for a societal decision on whether or not a risk should be taken and, if so, how it might be reduced or contained. Risk appraisal thus comprises a scientific assessment of both the risk and questions that stakeholders may have concern- ing its social and economic implications. (Renn, 2007a)
	•	The first component of risk appraisal – risk assessment – seeks to link a potential source of harm, a hazard, with likely consequences, specifying prob- abilities of occurrence for the latter. Depending on the source of a risk and the organizational culture of the community dealing with it, many different ways exist for structuring risk assessment. Despite such diversity, however, three core steps can be identified: the identification and, if possible, estimation of the hazard, an assessment of related exposure and/or vulnerability, and an estimation of the consequent risk. (Renn, 2007a)
	•	The last step – risk estimation – aggregates the results of the first two steps and gives a probability of occurrence for each conceivable degree of severity of the consequences. Confirming the results of risk assessments can be extremely difficult, in particular when cause–effect relationships are hard to establish, when they are unstable due to variations in both causes and effects, and when effects are both scarce and difficult to understand. Depending on the achievable state and quality of knowledge, risk assessment is thus confronted with three major challenges that can best be summarized using the risk categories outlined above – ‘complexity’, ‘uncer- tainty’ and ‘ambiguity’. For a successful outcome to the risk process and, indeed, overall risk governance, it is crucial that the implications of these chal- lenges are made transparent at the conclusion of risk assessment and throughout all subsequent phases. (Renn, 2007a)
	•	The second component of risk appraisal – concern assessment – thus complements the results from risk assessment with insights from risk perception studies and interdisciplinary analyses of the risk’s (secondary) social and economic implications. (Renn, 2007a)
	•	The term risk appraisal has sometimes been used in the risk governance litera- ture to include all knowledge elements necessary for risk characterization and evaluation as well as risk management (Stirling, 1998 and 2003). (Renn, 2007b)
	•	Risk appraisal thus includes the scientific assessment of the risks to human health and the environment and an assessment of related concerns, as well as social and economic implications. (Renn, 2007b)
	•	Risk appraisal intends to produce the best possible scientific estimate of the physical, economic and social consequences of a risk source. It should not be confused with direct stakeholder involvement, which will be covered later. Involvement by stakeholders and the population is only desirable at this stage if knowledge from these sources is needed to improve the quality of the assess- ments. (Renn, 2007b)
Risk appraisal process
	•	The appraisal process is and should be clearly dominated by scientific analyses, but, in contrast to the traditional risk governance model, the scientific process includes both the natural/technical as well as the social sciences, including economics. 
	•	We envision risk appraisal as having two process stages: first, natural and technical scientists use their skills to produce the best estimate of the physical harm that a risk source may induce (as described in the section on risk assessment, page 24); second, social scien- tists and economists identify and analyse the issues that individuals or society as a whole link with a certain risk.
Risk management phase
	•	The risk management phase designs and implements the actions and reme- dies required to tackle risks with the aim of avoiding, reducing, transferring or retaining them. Risk management thereby relies on a sequence of six steps which facilitates systematic decision-making. To start with, and based on a reconsideration of the knowledge gained in the risk appraisal phase and while judging the acceptability and/or tolerability of a given risk, a range of potential risk management options is identified. These options are then assessed with regard to criteria such as effectiveness, efficiency, minimization of external side effects, sustainability and so forth. These assessment results are next complemented by a value judgement on the relative weight of each of the assessment criteria, allowing an evaluation of the risk management options. This evaluation supports the next step in which one (or more) of the risk management options is selected, normally after consideration of possible trade-offs that need to be made between a number of second-best options. The final two steps include the implementation of the selected options and the periodic monitoring and review of their performance. (Renn, 2007a)
Inclusion of the societal context
	•	Besides the generic elements of risk assessment, risk management and risk communication, the framework gives equal importance to contextual aspects, which are either directly integrated in a model risk process comprising of the above and additional elements or form the basic conditions for making any risk-related decision. Contextual aspects of the first category include the structure and interplay of the different actors dealing with risks, how these actors may differently perceive the risks and what concerns they have regarding their likely conse- quences. Examples of the second category include the policy-making or regulatory style as well as the socio-political impacts prevalent within the entities and institutions having a role in the risk process, their organiza- tional imperatives and the capacity needed for effective risk governance. Linking the context with risk governance, the framework reflects the important role of risk–benefit evaluation and the need for resolving risk–risk trade-offs. (Renn, 2007a)

Categorization of risk-related knowledge 
	•	The framework also proposes a categorization of risk which is based on the different states of knowledge about each particular risk, distinguishing between ‘simple’, ‘complex’, ‘uncertain’ and ‘ambiguous’ risk problems. The characterization of a particular risk depends on the degree of difficulty of establishing the cause–effect relationship between a risk agent and its potential consequences, the reliability of this relationship and the degree of controversy with regard to both what a risk actually means for those affected and the values to be applied when judging whether or not something needs to be done about it. Examples of each risk category include, respectively, known health risks such as those related to smoking; the failure risk of interconnected technical systems such as the electricity transmission grid; atrocities such as those resulting from the changed nature and scale of international terrorism; and the long-term effects and ethical acceptability of controver- sial technologies such as nanotechnologies. For each category, a strategy is then derived for risk assessment and risk management, as well as the level and form of stakeholder participation, supported by proposals for appro- priate methods and tools. (Renn, 2007a)
Risk management
	•	Managing risk depends critically on management systems of representation, and on instruments for framing objects for the purpose of action and intervention (Power, 2009)
	•	risk management' and `governance' are fundamentally about the design of contracts with the power to bond agents to principals. (Power, 2009)
	•	Risk management is always a practice under some description or other, a description which embodies ideas about purpose and which embeds practices in larger systems of value and belief (Power, 2009)
	•	risk management is 'uncertainty management' in Knightean terms, i.e. efforts to manage 'risk objects' for which probability and outcome data are, at a point in time, unavailable or defective (Power, 2009)
	•	While ideas of risk management have been mobilized in part by values of enterprise, opportunity, and governance, cultural ideals of precision and auditability also play a critical role in shaping the form of these designs (Power, 2009)
	•	risk management has become the latest mode of 'watchfulness in society' (Cooper and Lousada, 2005) which gives rise to new skills in 'controlled self-presentation' (Williams,2000) (Power, 2009)
	•	risk management, like audit before it, has expanded rapidly from being a specific instrument of government to becoming an entire rationality of governing (Power, 2009)
	•	Risk management would be characterized more by learning and experiment, rather than by juridified processes (Power, 2009)
	•	In the past, risk management decisions were based primarily on common sense, ordinary knowledge, trial and error, or nonscientific knowledge and beliefs. In recent years risk management decisions have been increasingly based on highly technical quantitative risk analyses. (Covello and Mumpower, 1986)
	•	Risk management comprise all activities towards the assessing, mitigating (to acceptable levels) and monitoring of risks. (IEA Greenhouse Gas R&D Programme, 2009)
	•	According to the ISO/DIS 31000 standard, the process of risk management includes the establishment of the context or assessment base, the identification of potential risks and the assessment and treatment of identified risks. (IEA Greenhouse Gas R&D Programme, 2009)
	•	Furthermore, a risk-management plan should be developed and implemented, describing risk control implementation and responsibilities (ISO, 2009). (IEA Greenhouse Gas R&D Programme, 2009)
	•	Risk management is an integral component of CO2 storage operations (including site selection, site characterization and storage system design), comprising risk assessment and the development of mitigation, monitoring and remediation strategies. (IEA Greenhouse Gas R&D Programme, 2009)
	•	They offered the following definition for risk management (NAS, 1983 pages 18 19): The Committee uses the term risk management to describe the process of evaluating alternative regulatory actions and selecting among them. Risk management, which is carried out by regulatory agencies under various legislative mandates, is an agency decision-making process that entails consideration of political social. economic, and engineering information with risk-related information to develop, analyze. and compare regulatory options and to select the appropriate regulatory response to a potential chronic health hazard. The selection process necessarily requires the use of value judgments on such issues as the acceptability of risk and the reasonableness of the costs of control. (Paustenbach, 2002c)
	•	Ideally, risk management should be guided by the facts. Those facts concern not just the sizes of the risks and benefits involved, but also the changes in political and social status that arise from the risk-management process. (Fischhoff, 1995)
	•	the most interesting and unpredictable factor in risk management is the indirect benefits of a particular decision. (Williams and Paustenbach, 2002)
	•	As we attempt to improve the risk management process, more emphasis will likely be placed on identifying possible risk trade-offs associated with alternative decisions. (Williams and Paustenbach, 2002)
	•	Risk management was defined in the Commission's reports as comprising the following six stages: formulate the problem in broad context, analyze the risks, define the options, make sound decisions, take actions to implement the decisions, and perform an evaluation of the effectiveness or the actions taken (see Figure 512). This framework, along with the CRAM's emphasis on stakeholder involvement, will likely represent the next level of maturation in the field of risk management. (Williams and Paustenbach, 2002)
	•	both risk assessments and risk management strategies limit the power of the administrator. (Lofstedt, 2011)
	•	Once this judgement is made it is the task of risk management to prevent, reduce or alter these consequences by choosing appropriate actions. (Renn, 2007a)
	•	a tool for handling risks (Renn, 2007a)
	•	Risk management may alter human wants or needs (so that the agent is not even created or continued); it can suggest substitutes or alternatives for the same need; it can relocate or isolate activities so that exposure is prevented; or it can make risk targets less vulnerable to potential harm. (Renn, 2007a)
	•	management encompasses a much larger domain and may even occur before assessments are performed. (Renn, 2007a)
	•	risk management refers to the creation and evaluation of options for initiating or changing human activities or natural and artificial structures with the objective being to increase the net benefit to human society and prevent harm to humans and what they value. The identification of these options and their evaluation is guided by systematic and experiential knowledge gained and prepared for this purpose by experts and stakeholders. (Renn, 2007a)
	•	Risk management starts with a review of all relevant information, in particular that from the combined risk appraisal, consisting of both a risk assessment and a concern assessment, the latter based on risk perception studies, economic impact assessments and the scientific characterization of social responses to the risk source. This information, together with the judgements made in the phase of risk characterization and evaluation, form the input material on which risk management options are assessed, evaluated and selected. (Renn, 2007b)
	•	risk management is presented with three potential outcomes:1 intolerable situation: this means that either the risk source (such as a technology or a chemical) needs to be abandoned or replaced or, in cases where that is not possible (for example natural hazards), vulnerabilities need to be reduced and exposure restricted;2 tolerable situation: this means that the risks need to be reduced or handled in some other way within the limits of reasonable resource investments (ALARP, including best practice). This can be done by private actors (such as corporate risk managers) or public actors (such as regulatory agencies) or both (public–private partnerships); or 3 acceptable situation: this means that the risks are so small – perhaps even regarded as negligible – that any risk reduction effort is unnecessary. However, risk sharing via insurances and/or further risk reduction on a voluntary basis present options for action which can be worthwhile pursu- ing even in the case of an acceptable risk. (Renn, 2007b)
	•	Risk management has become increasingly politicized and contentious. Polarized views, controversy, and overt conflict have become pervasive. (Slovic, 1993)
	•	Conflicts and controversies surrounding risk management are not due to public irrationality or ignorance but, instead, can be seen as expected side effects of these psychological tendencies, interacting with our remarkable form of participatory democratic government, and amplified by certain powerful technological and social changes in our society. (Slovic, 1993)
	•	trust in risk management institutions may be an important factor in perception and acceptance of risks. (Poortinga and Pidgeon, 2003)
	•	Public reliance is a necessary component of effective risk management in democratic societies. (Cvetkovich, 2005)
	•	The dilemma of risk management is that it is virtually impossible from a values point of view to have anyone but the affected people make the final choice, yet often these people can be whipped up emotionally and make what appear from the point of view of experts to be irrational choices. (Crosby, 1995)
	•	Risk management is the process of weighing policy alternatives and selecting the most appropriate regulatory action, integrating the results of risk assessment with engineering data and with social, economic, and political concerns to reach a decision. (National Research Council, 1983)
	•	The Committee uses the term risk management to describe the process of evaluating alternative regulatory actions and selecting among them. (National Research Council, 1983)
	•	risk management considerations (the desire to regulate or not to regulate) may influence the choices made by the assessors. (National Research Council, 1983)
	•	Risk management is the term applied to the process of deciding whether a risk requires reduction, identifying the options for risk reduction, selecting the means for and objectives of risk reduction, and implementing those means. (Rodricks et al., 1987)
	•	Risk management incorporates not only risk information, but also information on technical feasibility, cost, and other social benefits, as well as political factors. The extent to which this additional information influences risk management decisions largely depends upon the requirements of applicable statutes and the habits of thinking that have evolved within the responsible regulatory agencies (NRC, 1983). (Rodricks et al., 1987)
	•	The NAO sought to transfer commercial practices to government with the following promise: Risk management can help departments improve their performance in a number of ways. It can lead to better service delivery, more efficient use of resources, better project management, help minimize waste, fraud and poor value for money, and promote innocation. (2000, p.4). (Newsome, 2013)
	•	According to Bracken, Bremmer, and Gordon, “Risk management is about insight, not numbers. It isn’t the predictions that matter most but the understanding and discovery of the dynamics of the problems” (2008, p. 6). (Newsome, 2013)

	•	Risk management is truly a management process, whereas a risk assessment is simply a component of that continual management process. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	Risk management is the process of anticipating future losses and using risk mitigation strategies for reducing or eliminating that risk. Generally, five strategies may be employed to deal with risk: avoidance, reduction, spreading, transfer, and acceptance. (Vellani, 2007)

	•	Risk management addresses the ways in which agencies plan for and react to threats and incidents, in particular, in the judgements that they make about resource allocations. (Kennedy and McGarrell, 2011)
	•	Management also addresses a variety of issues related to the legitimate exercise of authority and oversight of the agencies delegated responsibility for risk assessment. (Kennedy and McGarrell, 2011)

	•	The age of total objectives would seem to have passed; risk management requires a different framework of analysis. (Coker, 2009)
	•	Risk management may be a long-term strategy, but it usually comprises a series of short-term measures, not grand projects such as the nation-building efforts of 1945−50. (Coker, 2009)
	•	Risk management is about minimizing insecurity, not providing a secure world. (Coker, 2009)
	•	The problem with risk management, writes Beck, is that we can all agree on what we don’t want (e.g. a nuclear Iran); we find it much more challenging to reach agreement on how to prevent it (Adam 2003:218). (Coker, 2009)
	•	Risk management revolves around probabilities. (Coker, 2009)

	•	information is the life-blood of risk management. (Coker, 2009)
	•	It is the management, not reduction of risk, that should preoccupy the best political minds, as it does the best minds in business, and success will depend ultimately on the geo-political narratives we construct. (Coker, 2009)
	•	The overall goal of risk management is prudently buying down risk where possible, while preparing to respond effectively in those areas where no level of risk mitigation is likely to drive hazards toward being unlikely. (Freier, 2009)
	•	the aim of managing risks is to reduce them from what they would otherwise have been. Any measure that is purposefully taken before a risk materializes, and that makes the residual risk more acceptable, contributes to this task. Since risk is often conceptualized in terms of likelihood and consequences, measures to reduce it often address the probability of the risk materializing, or its consequences should it do so. (Frühling, 2014)
	•	Since risk arises from uncertainty, reducing uncertainty is an important way of managing risk. (Frühling, 2014)

	•	Risk management is a continuous process that depends directly on the changes of the internal and external environment of the organization. In reality the changes in the environment require continuous attention for identification and control of risks. (Tchankova, 2002)
	•	Risk management is about taking managed risks to achieve desired objectives. (Omand, 2014)
	•	It is inherent in risk management that the decision-taker accepts that the risk may not pay off, and explains that clearly to those who may be affected. (Omand, 2014)
	•	As in any exercise in risk management, the implications as evaluated by government will depend as discussed in chapter 2 upon the combined effect of three different kinds of factors: likelihood, vulnerability and impact (and likelihood, exploitability and pay-off in case of opportunities identified). Intelligence can illuminate all three factors, but principally likelihood. (Omand, 2014)
	•	Risk management is a decision-making tool that can be used at all levels of leadership to aid in making sound, logival deicsions. There are five steps to the risk management process. It begins by identifying possible hazards, assessing/analysing those hazards to determine the probability of their occurring and the secerity of the consequences if they do occur, making a decision, implementing that decision, and supervising/follozing-up on the decision. (Walick, 1994)
Risk management methods
	•	Risk management methodologies, such as Mehari, Ebios, CRAMM and SP 800-30 (NIST) use a common step based on threat, vulnerability and probability witch are typically evaluated intuitively using verbal hazard scales such as low, medium, high. Because of their subjectivity, these categories are extremely difficult to assign to threats, vulnerabilities and probability, or indeed, to interpret with any degree of confidence. (Ghazouani et al., 2014)
	•	Risk management methods enable the organization to plan and implement programs to maximize their opportunities and to control the impact of potential threats. There are many risk management methods in use today. 
	•	A method or framework for managing risks aims at assisting an organization manages its risk exposures effectively through the application of the risk management process at various levels within of the organization. (Ghazouani et al., 2014)
	•	A risk management method is a sequences of activities based on a published standard that systematizes the five phases that comprise risk management, namely, [1] identification of threats and vulnerabilities impacting the organization's IT assets; Risk assessment; Risk mitigation planning; Risk mitigation implementation; Evaluation of the mitigation's effectiveness. (Ghazouani et al., 2014)
Risk manamgemt process
	•	The risk management process involves assessing threats, vulnerabilities, and risk, evaluating and selecting security measures to reduce identified risks, and implementing and monitoring the selected measures to ensure that the meas- ures are effective. (Vellani, 2007)
Risk manager
	•	the risk manager must consider the results of the risk characterization when evaluating the economics. societal aspects, and various benefits of the risk assessment. (Paustenbach, 2002c)
	•	Risk managers increasingly rely on risk assessment to decide whether a broad array of risks are significant or trivial (Paustenbach, 2002a)
	•	In the coming years, many risk managers will therefore be seeking information from the risk characterization. which will assist them in addressing the key concerns raised by the pre- cautionary principal (EEA, 2001). (Williams and Paustenbach, 2002)
	•	Although it the duty of the risk manager to consider relevant scientific and nonscientific factors, both scientific judgments and policy choices may be involved in the risk assessment process when selecting from among possible inferential bridges (Williams and Paustenbach, 2002)
	•	At a minimum, risk managers will be presented with a qualitative uncertainty analysis, although there has been a growing expectation for quantitative uncertainty analyses. (Williams and Paustenbach, 2002)
	•	risk managers also need to act in situations of ‘non-knowledge’ or insufficient knowledge about potential outcomes of human actions or activities. (Renn, 2007a)
	•	Risk managers should remain aware of both positive and negative risks and not use confusing synonyms or conflacted concepts to describe these categories. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Although risk managers should always consider wether they have forgotten positive risks, in practice most risk managers are concerned with negative risks most of the time. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Risk or security managers often are criticized for finding risks everywhere and for imposing impractical advisories (such as bans on scissors that could cut or sports that could injure) to protect the public’s health and safety (Newsome, 2013)
	•	The risk manager’s role in advocating risk management is indicated by parts of the Autralian and British governments that formally refer to lower risk managers as “risk champions.” (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Understandably, most actors are private about their security and risk management structures, but we know that the structures of organizations are pulled in many directions by resources constraints, bureaucratic interests, political issue-linkage, and simple path-dependency, so organizational structure is commonly suboptimal, particularly in very small or poor organizations and in very large organizations (which have more resources but are subject to more vectors). (Newsome, 2013)
	•	If the risk managers can see what is going on at all the organization's levels ± administration, R&D, technological, etc. ± they will know where a peril will occur, how an action in one level can develop a hazard in another, the conflicts that will be revealed, etc. (Tchankova, 2002)

Industrial risk managers
	•	industrial risk managers search for the most efficient strategy to deal with risks. (Renn, 2007b)
Risk management decisions
	•	Risk management decisions always have to be based on the available information. Waiting until we have all the information we want means to let potential damage occur in the meantime. (Swedish Chemicals Agency et al., 2007)
	•	“Experience increasingly shows that risk management decisions that are made in collaboration with stakeholders are more effective and more durable.” (Chess and Purcell, 1999)
Risk management cycle
	•	A risk management cycle represents a series of analytical and managerial steps, basically sequential, that can be used to assess risk, evaluate alternatives for reducing risks, choose among those alternatives, implement the alternatives, monitor their implementation, and continually use new information to adjust and revise the assessments and actions, as needed. (Office, 2005)
	•	Adoption of a risk management cycle such as this can aid in assessing risk by determining which vulnerabilities should be addressed, and how they should be addressed, within available resources. (Office, 2005)
Enterprise risk management
	•	In part this is a calculative project involving forms of analysis and measurement techniques aimed at a total risk profile or value for an organization (Power, 2009)
	•	ERM is an ideal abstracted from different sources--insurance, economic capital modelling, and internal control. It characterizes a new normative environment for organizations in the form of standards which prescribe the components of the risk management process (Power, 2009)
	•	ERM ideas have acquired normative status, despite their obvious unreality, because they reproduce rational myths of controllability, not least of which is the fictional possibility of grasping an organization in its entirety (cf. Strathern, 2000a: 316). (Power, 2009)
	•	ERM grew from ideas of internal control, which have a long history as a hybrid of systems, accounting, and organizational bodies of knowledge. (Power, 2009) 
	•	ERM has become a conceptual umbrella, a view from above, for a mix of managerial risk objects which had been functionally separate: legal compliance, strategic clarity, market volatility, execution capability, information security, and many others can now be imagined together. (Power, 2009)
 
Risk management of everything
	•	The risk management of everything involves the creation of new risk categories for managerial and political attention (Power, 2004)
	•	risk management of everything has its roots in defensive strategies (Power, 2004)
	•	The risk management of everything implies a society of ‘small print’ (Power, 2004)
	•	The risk management of everything is characterised by an intensification of internal responsibility, accountability and ‘sign off ’ structures (Power, 2004)
	•	The risk management of everything is closely related to an ambition to measure everything (Power, 2004)
	•	The risk management of everything implies that risk management is becoming an administrative paradigm for all forms of organisation, including government (Power, 2004)
	•	the risk management of everything appears like the audit of everything and its associated concerns with extending public and private accountability (Power, 2004)
	•	according to Power, not only are we living in a ‘Risk Society’, but we are now concerned with the ‘risk management of everything’ (Rothstein et al., 2006)
Effective risk management
	•	Effective management requires that the public rely on tech- nical risk assessments and formulated risk mitigation plans. (Cvetkovich, 2005)
	•	Successful risk manage- ment, like successful policing of the streets at home, requires the managers to be well informed. (Coker, 2009)
Project risk management
	•	Project risk management is tainted by repeated official and corporate failures to manage the largest acquisition projects. (Newsome, 2013)
Strategic risk management
	•	Some authors distinguish strategic risk management, which “addresses interactions between pure and speculative risks” […]. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Strategic risk management, which “addresses interactions between pure and speculative risks” (Waring & Glendon 1998, p. 14). For instance, your exposure to natural disaster (natural risk) could deter investors (financial risk), or a potential financial crisis (financial risk) suggests potential collapse in outside resourcing of your security. (Newsome, 2013)
Enterprise risk management
	•	Enterprise risk management, which “addresses interactions between pure and speculative risks” (Waring & Glendon 1998, p. 14) or is “making useof methods and processes to capitalize on opportunities or avoid hazards to meet institutional goals” (Kennedy & Van Brunschot, 2009, p. 28).
Integrated risk management
	•	Integrated risk management is “a continuous, proactive and systematic process to understand, manage and communicate risk from an organization-wide perspective and to support strategic decision making that contributes to the achievement of an organization’s overall objectives” (Public Safety Canada, 2012, p. 56), or a “multi-agencyapproach to emergency management entailing six key activities— anticipation,assessment, prevention, preparation, response, and recovery” (U.K. Cabinet Office, 2013).
Risk management framework
	•	The most internationally influential process since 1995 is the Australian/New Zealand standard (also the ISO process since 2009), with seven well-established higher steps. It defines the “risk management process” as the “systematic application of management policies, procedures, and practices to the activities of communicating, consulting establishing the context, and identifying analysing, evaluating, treating, monitoring and reviewing risk”. It distinguishes the process from the “framework’ (the “set of components that provide the foundations and organizational arrangements for designing, implementing, monitoring, reviewing, and continually improving risk management throughout the organization”) (Newsome, 2013)
Good risk management processes
	•	[…] good risk management processes prescribe monitoring the risk, even after control. (Newsome, 2013)
Terrorism risk management
	•	In the context of the US Department of Homeland Security and law envorcement agencies, a risk management approach to the threat of terrorism requires building information tools and systems, analytic capabilities, information dissemination, preparedness systems, and the leadership and management processes for and in coordination with the private sector. (Kennedy and McGarrell, 2011)
Risk management strategies
	•	Risk management encompasses a series of strategies or models. (Löfstedt, 2005)
	•	Max Weber, for example, defines four risk management ‘ideal types’:(a) political regulatory process, including litigation;(b) public deliberation;(c) the technocratic /scientific perspective;(d) risk management on strict economic grounds. (Löfstedt, 2005)
	•	These ‘ideal types’ are customized to fit individual nations’ needs but have different histories and came into the risk management fold at different times. (Löfstedt, 2005)
	•	A risk management strategy is any purposeful response to insecurity or risk; the strategy might be emergent or subconscious, but must aim to affect security or risk. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	The strategy is usefully distinguished from the controls – the particular actions used to change a particular risk, such as a guard acquired as part of a protective strategy. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Many authorities on risk management have offered a set of recommended responses to risk or approaches to security that they usually term treatments, approaches or responses. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	The British Treasury (2004) defines a risk management strategy as “the overall organizational approach to risk management as defined by the Accounting Officer and/or Board” (p. 50). (Newsome, 2013)

Simple risk problems 

	•	This class of risk problems requires hardly any deviation from traditional decision-making. Data is provided by statistical analysis, goals are determined by law or statutory requirements, and the role of risk management is to ensure that all risk reduction measures are implemented and enforced. Traditional risk–risk comparisons (or risk–risk trade-offs), risk–benefit analysis and cost-effectiveness studies are the instruments of choice for finding the most appropriate risk reduction measures. Additionally, risk managers can rely on best practice and, in cases of low impact, on trial and error. It should be noted, however, that simple risks should not be equated with small or negligible risks. The major issues here are that the potential negative consequences are obvious, the values that are applied are non-controversial and the remaining uncertainties low. (Renn, 2007b)
Complex risk problem
	•	Complex risk management problems, particularly involving matters of public policy, are mistakenly conceived as machine-like problems of risk analysis. (Power, 2009)
	•	For this risk class major input for risk management is provided by the scientific characterization of the risk. Complex risk problems are often associated with major scientific dissent about complex dose–effect relationships or the alleged effectiveness of measures to decrease vulnerabilities (complexity refers to both the risk agent and its causal connections and the risk-absorbing system and its vulnerabilities). The objective for resolving complexity is to receive a complete and balanced set of risk and concern assessment results that fall within the legitimate range of plural truth claims. (Renn, 2007b)
	•	Traditional methods such as risk–risk-comparison, cost-effectiveness and cost–benefit analysis are also well-suited to facilitate the overall judgement for placing the risk in the traffic-light model (acceptable, tolerable or intolerable). These instruments, if properly used, provide effective, efficient and fair solutions with respect to finding the best trade-off between opportunities and risks. The choice of instruments includes all the classic options outlined in the section on risk management. (Renn, 2007b)
Risk problems due to high unresolved uncertainty
	•	If there is a high degree of remaining uncertainties, risk management needs to incorporate hazard criteria (which are comparatively easy to determine), including aspects such as reversibility, persistence and ubiquity, and select management options empowering society to deal even with worst- case scenarios (such as containment of hazardous activities, close monitoring of risk-bearing activities or securing reversibility of decisions in case risks turn out to be higher than expected). We would argue that the management of risks characterized by multiple and high uncertainties should be guided by the precautionary approach. (Renn, 2007b)
Rechnocratic risk management approach
	•	The technocratic approach, as advocated by Breyer, is to avoid inconsistencies caused by public and interest group opinion in the regulatory structures. (Löfstedt, 2005)
	•	Policy-makers and regulators tend to favour the technocratic risk management perspective. It is more efficient (both in terms of time and money) than the deliberative approach and less controversial than the economic risk management alternative. (Löfstedt, 2005)
	•	 The technocratic approach is arguably the exact opposite of the deliberative one. (Löfstedt, 2005)

Rite
	•	C’est alors qu’intervient le processus de l’institutionnalisation dont un des buts primordiaux est de fixer la forme de la « communion » par un ensemble de rites. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	le rite est « un acte qui peut être individuel ou collectif mais qui, toujours, lors même qu’il est assez souple pour comporter une marge d’improvisation, reste fidèle à certaines règles qui, précisément, constituent ce qu’il y a en lui de rituel », et, ajoute notre auteur, « la répétition est donnée dans l’essence même du rite ». (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	itératif et réglé ne peut s’expliquer par le hasard et remplit une fonction importante. Celle-ci semble devoir être recherchée du côté de la tendance à l’uniformité, à l’ordre et à la cohésion. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Point de vue qui appelle à un élargissement de notre perspective et à une assimilation des fêtes, célébrations et commémorations aux rites, l’ensemble constituant les traditions. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Ils sont des temps forts rythmant la vie sociale qui ne saurait s’en passer. (Mannoni, 1985)
Reputational risk management
	•	reputational risk management is paradoxical not least because external forces are prominent in defining and calculating organizational reputation (Power, 2009)
	•	Reputational risk does not exist outside the diverse discourses and instrumentalities which give it a governing role in organizational life. (Power, 2009)
	•	Reputation has come to play a central role in world-level conceptions of organizations as responsible actors with much to lose and which are being increasingly evaluated by external bodies. Organizational efforts to 'manage' reputation constantly encounter it as a disorderly, overflowing, and amplifying risk object. (Power, 2009)
	•	Reputation has come to be a modality of organizational governance but is not itself uniquely governed by any specific interest group or expertise. (Power, 2009)
Impaired reputation 
	•	the expectations space in which these second-order managerial risk objects have been generated has created yet a further risk, namely 'impaired reputation' and 'loss of legitimacy', resulting from the disappointment of those expectations (Power, 2009) 

Role-playing
	•	People tend to wear the mask that shows them off in the best possible light—humble, confident, diligent. They say the right things, smile, and seem interested in our ideas. They learn to conceal their insecurities and envy. If we take this appearance for reality, we never really know their true feelings, and on occasion we are blindsided by their sudden resistance, hostility, and manipulative actions. Fortunately, the mask has cracks in it. People continually leak out their true feelings and unconscious desires in the nonverbal cues they cannot completely control—facial expressions, vocal inflections, tension in the body, and nervous gestures. (Greene, 2018)
	•	since appearances are what people judge you by, you must learn how to present the best front and play your role to maximum effect. (Greene, 2018)
	•	We humans are consummate actors. We learn at an early age how to get what we want from our parents by putting on certain looks that will elicit sympathy or affection. We learn how to conceal from our parents or siblings exactly what we’re thinking or feeling, to protect ourselves in vulnerable moments. We become good at flattering those whom it is important to win over—popular peers or teachers. We learn how to fit into the group by wearing the same clothes and speaking the same language. As we get older and strive to carve out a career, we learn how to create the proper front in order to be hired and to fit into a group culture. If we become an executive or a professor or a bartender, we must act the part. (Greene, 2018)
	•	We are all such good actors that we’re not even aware of this as it happens. We imagine we are almost always being sincere in our social encounters, which any good actor will tell you is the secret behind really believable acting. We take these skills for granted, but to see them in action, try to look at yourself as you interact with different members of your family and with your boss and colleagues at work. You will see yourself subtly changing what you say, your tone of voice, your mannerisms, your whole body language, to suit each individual and situation. For people you are trying to impress, you wear a much different face than with those with whom you are familiar and can let down your guard. You do this almost without thinking. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Over the centuries various writers and thinkers, looking at humans from an outside perspective, have been struck by the theatrical quality of social life. The most famous quote expressing this comes from Shakespeare: “All the world’s a stage, / And all the men and women merely players; / They have their exits and their entrances, / And one man in his time plays many parts.” (Greene, 2018)
	•	If the theater and actors were traditionally represented by the image of masks, writers such as Shakespeare are implying that all of us are constantly wearing masks. Some people are better actors than others. Villainous types such as Iago in the play Othello are able to conceal their hostile intentions behind a friendly, benign smile. Others are able to act with more confidence and bravado—they often become leaders. People with consummate acting skills can better navigate our complex social environments and get ahead. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Although we are all expert actors, at the same time we secretly experience this need to act and play a part as a burden. (Greene, 2018)
	•	you must understand and accept the theatrical quality of life. You do not moralize and rail against the Role-playing and the wearing of masks so essential to smooth social functioning. In fact, your goal is to play your part on the stage of life with consummate skill, attracting attention, dominating the limelight, and making yourself into a sympathetic hero or heroine. (Greene, 2018)
	•	you must not be naive and mistake people’s appearances for reality. You are not blinded by people’s acting skills. You transform yourself into a master decoder of their true feelings, working on your observation skills and practicing them as much as you can in daily life. (Greene, 2018)
	•	there are three aspects to this particular law: understanding how to observe people; learning some basic keys for decoding nonverbal communication; and mastering the art of what is known as impression management, playing your role to maximum effect. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Remember that people are generally trying to present the best possible front to the world. This means concealing their possible antagonistic feelings, their desires for power or superiority, their attempts at ingratiation, and their insecurities. They will use words to hide their feelings and distract you from the reality, playing on people’s verbal fixation. They will also use certain facial expressions that are easy to put on and that people assume mean friendliness. Your task is to look past the distractions and become aware of those signs that leak out automatically, revealing something of the true emotion beneath the mask. The three categories of the most important cues to observe and identify are dislike/like, dominance/submission, and deception. (Greene, 2018)
	•	In general the word Role-playing has negative connotations. We contrast it with authenticity. A person who is truly authentic doesn’t need to play a role in life, we think, but can simply be him- or herself. This concept has value in friendships and in our intimate relationships, where, hopefully, we can drop the masks we wear and feel comfortable in displaying our unique qualities. But in our professional life it is much more complicated. When it comes to a specific job or role to play in society, we have expectations about what is professional. We would be made to feel uncomfortable if our airplane pilot suddenly started to act like a car salesman, or a mechanic like a therapist, or a professor like a rock musician. If such people acted completely like themselves, dropping their masks and refusing to play their roles, we would question their competence. A politician or public figure whom we see as more authentic than others is generally better at projecting such a quality. They know that appearing humble, or discussing their private life, or telling an anecdote that reveals some vulnerability will have the “authentic” effect. We are not seeing them as they are in the privacy of their home. Life in the public sphere means wearing a mask, and sometimes some people wear the mask of “authenticity.” Even the hipster or the rebel is playing a role, with prescribed poses and tattoos. They do not have the freedom to suddenly wear a business suit, because others in their circle would begin to question their sincerity, which depends on displaying the right appearance. People have more freedom to bring more of their personal qualities into the role they play once they have established themselves and their competence is no longer in question. But this is always within limits. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Consciously or unconsciously most of us adhere to what is expected of our role because we realize our social success depends on this. Some may refuse to play this game, but in the end they are marginalized and forced to play the outsider role, with limited options and decreasing freedom as they get older. In general, it is best to simply accept this dynamic and derive some pleasure from it. You are not only aware of the proper appearances you must present but know how to shape them for maximum effect. You can then transform yourself into a superior actor on the stage of life and enjoy your moment in the limelight. (Greene, 2018)
	•	The word personality comes from the Latin persona, which means “mask.” In the public we all wear masks, and this has a positive function. If we displayed exactly who we are and spoke our minds truthfully, we would offend almost everyone and reveal qualities that are best concealed. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Having a persona, playing a role well, actually protects us from people looking too closely at us, with all of the insecurities that would churn up. In fact, the better you play your role, the more power you will accrue, and with power you will have the freedom to express more of your peculiarities. If you take this far enough, the persona you present will match many of your unique characteristics, but always heightened for effect. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Do not be afraid to bring out the more sensitive or ambitious sides to your character. These repressed parts of you are yearning to be let out. In the theater of life, expand the roles that you play. Don’t worry about people’s reactions to any changes in you they sense. You are not so easy to categorize, which will fascinate them and give you the power to play with their perceptions of you, altering them at will. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Les rôles font les hommes plus encore que les hommes ne font les rôles : ainsi le veut le jeu social. (Mannoni, 1985)
Symptoms
	•	One final but very subtle nonverbal means of asserting dominance in a relationship comes through the symptom. One partner suddenly develops headaches or some other illness, or starts drinking, or generally falls into a negative pattern of behavior. This forces the other side to play by their rules, to tend to their weaknesses. It is the willful use of sympathy to gain power and it is extremely effective. (Greene, 2018)
Role of science in policy-making
	•	role of science should be to provide information to those having to make decisions, including the public, and to ensure that the uncertainties around that information are made clear (Boyd, 2013)
	•	Science remains the pre-eminent form of expert legitimacy for government decisions. But experts can also be found offering their thoughts on culture (why is art important?), social policy (what is a liveable minimum wage?), economics (what should interest rates be?) and security (how long will it take a rogue dictator to launch his weapons of mass destruction?). (Stilgoe et al., 2006)
Rotation
	•	What is a rotation? Physically, it is a way to move an object by changing its orientation without changing its shape. Mathematically it is a transformation—an alternative word for ‘function’. A transformation is a rule F that associates to any appropriate ‘thing’ x another ‘thing’ F(x). (Stewart, 2013)
	•	We say that a circle is symmetric under all rotations. (Stewart, 2013)
	•	Rotations are invertible: the inverse of rotation by α is rotation by −α; that is, through the same angle, but in the opposite direction. (Stewart, 2013)
Rule
	•	such rules are merely guidelines, and to demonstrate our freedom we must violate them from time to time. (Greene, 2018)
Display rules
	•	Keep in mind that people from different cultures will consider different forms of behavior acceptable. These are known as display rules. In some cultures people are conditioned to smile less or touch more. Or their language involves greater emphasis on vocal pitch. Always consider the cultural background of people, and interpret their cues accordingly. (Greene, 2018)
Fundamental rule
	•	considering any rule, how- ever "fundamental," there are always circumstances when it is advisable not only to ignore the rule, but to adopt its opposite. For example, there are circumstances when it is advisable to introduce, elaborate, and defend ad hoc hyPotheses, or hypotheses which contradict well-established and generally accepted experimental results, or hypotheses whose content is smaller than the content of the existing and empirically adequate alternatives, or self-inconsistent hypotheses, and so on. (Feyerabend, 1993)
Rule of equality
	•	In itself the rule of equality has the unintended effect of impeding decision-taking and leadership. It has the further unintended effect of exposing the fragile fund of mutual trust to the strains of ambiguity (Douglas, 2005:139)
Rumour
	•	Maisonneuve (op. cit., p. 113) définit la rumeur « comme une nouvelle ou un récit transmis de bouche en bouche, de valeur incertaine, mais susceptible d’ébranle ou de cristaliser l’opinion publique. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Etant entendu que ce n’est pas la réalité objective des faits colportés qui compte mais bien davantage le prestige social de l’informateur et la charge affective de l’information : plus celle-ci est importante, aussi bien par son caractère inattendu que par son contenu dramatique, plus elle a de chances de diffuser avec, bien entendu, les diverses distorsions qu’elle subit inévitablement en cours de route.  (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	la loi d’appauvrissement ou de nivellement (plus le message est répété, plus les détails se perdent), la loi d’accentuation (renforcement des détails conservés) et la loi d’assimilation (réorganisation de l’ensemble autour du thème central). (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	intensité de la rumeur = f (intérêt x ambiguité). (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Signalons enfin que certains auteurs (Brunvand, 1981) décrivent un phénomène très voisin des rumeurs sous le nom de « légendes urbaines ». (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Souvent, sans bien s’en rendre compte, les journalistes en arrivent à se faire les relais amplificateurs de « bruits » sans fondement et à participer au renforcement des inquiétudes. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	là où les choses deviennent dangereuses c’est lorsque les moyens de communication entraînent la croyance des masses et les amènent à communiquer dans une de ces grandes « messes hypnotiques" dont parle S. Moscovici (op. cit;, p.279).
S
Saboteur
International saboteur
	•	We are born with a powerful energy that is distinctly human. We can call it willpower, assertiveness, or even aggression, but it is mixed with our intelligence and cleverness. It was revealed to us in its purest state in childhood. This energy made us bold and adventurous, not only physically but mentally, wanting to explore ideas and soak up knowledge. It made us actively search for friends with whom we could explore together. It also made us rather relentless when it came to solving problems or getting what we wanted. (Children can often be bold in what they ask for.) It made us open to the world and to new experiences. And if we felt frustrated and helpless for long enough periods of time, this same energy could make us unusually combative.As we get older and we encounter mounting frustrations, resistance from others, and feelings of impatience for power, some among us may become chronically aggressive. But another phenomenon is even more common: we become uncomfortable with and even frightened of that assertive energy within, and our own potential for aggressive behavior. Being assertive and adventurous could lead to some failed action, making us feel exposed and vulnerable. If we express this energy too much, people may not like us. We could stir up conflict. Perhaps our parents induced in us as well some shame for our aggressive outbursts. In any event, we may come to view the aggressive part of the self as dangerous. But since this energy cannot disappear, it turns inward, and we create what the great English psychoanalyst Ronald Fairbairn called the internal saboteur. (Greene, 2018)
	•	The saboteur operates like a persecutor from within, continually judging and attacking us. If we are about to attempt something, itreminds us of the potential for failure. It tries to tamp down any exuberance, because that could open us to criticism from others. It makes us uncomfortable with strong sensations of pleasure or the expression of deep emotion. It impels us to tamp down our ambitions, the better to fit into the group and not stand out. It wants us to retreat inward, where we can protect ourselves, even if that leads to depression. And it makes us forge a fake self to present to the world, one that is humble and self-effacing. In the end, the internal saboteur works to lower our energy and constrain what we do, making our world more manageable and predictable but also quite dead. It is the same goal as the aggressor—gaining control over uncertainty—but through the opposite means. (Greene, 2018)
	•	The internal saboteur can also have a dampening effect on our mental powers. It discourages us from being bold and adventurous in our thinking. We limit our ideas and settle for the conventional opinions of the group, because that is safer. Creative people display great aggressiveness in their thinking, as they try out many options and search for possible solutions. By trying to rid ourselves of any kind of aggressive impulse, we actually thwart our own creative energies. (Greene, 2018)
Sachant
	•	apprendre n'est pas savoir ; il y a les sachant et les savants : c'est la mémoire qui fait les uns, c'est la philosophie qui fait les autres.– Mais ne peut-on apprendre la philosophie  ? – La philosophie ne s'apprend pas ; la philosophie est la réunion des sciences acquises au génie qui les applique : la philosophie , c'est le nuage éclatant sur lequel le Christ a posé le pied pour remonter au ciel. (Dumas, 1998)
Sacred
	•	illusion only is sacred, truth profane. (Debord, 2012)
	•	the highest degree of illusion comes to be the highest degree of sacredness. (Debord, 2012)
	•	The sacred has justified the cosmic and ontological order which corresponded to the interests of the masters; it has explained and embellished that which society could not do. Thus all separate power has been spectacular, but the adherence of all to an immobile image only signified the common acceptance of an imaginary prolongation of the poverty of real social activity, still largely felt as a unitary condition. (Debord, 2012)
Sacrifice
	•	Au goût du mystère s’ajoute le sacrifice des victimes expiatoires, dont l’exécution renouvelée à intervalles réguliers entretient périodiquement le lien social. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	La solidarité à tout prix et, au besoin, « l’ordre par la terreur », selon l’expression d’H. Carrère d’Encausse (1979). (Mannoni, 1985)
Safe
	•	The label ‘safe’ has given new meaning to a wide range of phenomena such as ‘safe havens’ in Bosnia in the 1990s. (Coker, 2009)
Safety
	•	[…] safety implies temporary sanctuary rather than real security. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	[…] safety is “freedom from risk or harm as a result of unintentional acts (accidents, natural phenomenon, or illness).” (Newsome, 2013)
Personal safety
	•	Personal safety is now big business. (Coker, 2009) 
Safety Assessment Principles
	•	The Safety Assessment Principles seek to ensure that any plant is so designed that a release of radioactivity that could give this hypothetical person an effective dose of 100 mSv or more would have a very low chance of occurrence. A dose of 100 mSv is equivalent to an additional risk of fatal cancer of about 5 in 1000 using the current risk factors. (Great Britain and Health and Safety Executive, 1992)
Safety barriers
	•	Safety barriers are arranged in chains. The aim is to make each barrier independent of its predecessors so that if the first fails, then the second is still intact, etc. Typically the first barriers are measures to prevent an accident, after which follow barriers that limit the consequences of an accident, and finally rescue services as the last resort. (Swedish Chemicals Agency et al., 2007)
Safety culture
	•	Goodproceduresmustbesupportedbya culture which disposes every individual in the organisation towards safe working practices. (Great Britain and Health and Safety Executive, 1992)
	•	an effective system of safety management must include well considered and articulated safety policies; organisational arrangements which ensure control and promote cooperation, communication and competence; planning systems which identify objectives and targets, establish priorities and set performance standards; performance measurement which actively monitors the achievement of plans and the extent of compliance with standards, and reactively monitors accidents, incidents and ill health; and effective systems for auditing and performance review. (Great Britain and Health and Safety Executive, 1992)
Safety-critical computing systems in nuclear plant
	•	Modern plant is becoming increasingly complex: new technology allows us to have finer control and so run processes more efficiently; it also provides novel means of monitoring for increased safety. An important factor in these changes has been the increased use of computer systems, both to control plant and to help ensure its safe operation. Computers can monitor enormous amounts of data and thus allow plant designers to do things that would not be practicable with conventional engineering hardware. In nuclear power reactors, computers have been used for several years to help theoperators control the plant by presenting them with information in ways that are easily understandable: they are now also being used to control the plant automatically and shut it down safely in an emergency. In principle, and often sometimes in practice, computer systems can provide us with means of control that are more efficient and safer than would otherwise be possible. (Great Britain and Health and Safety Executive, 1992)
	•	However, the complexity of both the plant and the computer systems brings problems as well as benefits: the greater the complexity, the harder it is to be sure that there are no hidden design faults which can reveal themselves as failures during operation. This problem is particularly acute for computer software, which may be unreliable if its designers have not fully understood all aspects of the plant being controlled or if mistakes have been made in writing the program. Some software faults are minor and are relatively easy to detect, rather like spelling mistakes. Fundamental design faults are potentially much more serious and the more complex the software, the more likely theyare to arise and the more difficult they are to detect. (Great Britain and Health and Safety Executive, 1992)
	•	Good design practices can assist. Safety- critical software needs to have the greatest simplicity compatible with the system performing its tasks. The temptation for a designer, released from hardware limitations, to build programs of ever greater complexity has to be resisted. In addition, separation between computer programs performing safety functions, such as emergency shut-down, and those providing normal everyday control leads to a simpler safety system, aids an understanding of how it works, and minimises the chance of a single fault causing both loss of plant control and failure of the emergency shut-down. (Great Britain and Health and Safety Executive, 1992)
	•	Modern software practices include formal mathematical techniques, which sometimes allow a rigorous proof that a program will behave as specified. However, such a specification must itself be a formal mathematical document, and there is always a chance that this does not adequately capture all the engineered provisions for the safe functioning of the overall plant. Another recent approach has been to try to make software systems 'fault-tolerant' by using design diversity. This technique appears to bring useful, but not dramatic, benefits. (Great Britain and Health and Safety Executive, 1992)
	•	It is generally not practicable to test a computer program exhaustively for all its different input signals, since the number of different combinations of these is usually astronomical. Fairly modest levels of software reliability can be demonstrated, using a sample of these inputs that is statistically representative of operational use, but these fall short of the levels that are currently demonstrated for comparatively simpler, conventionally engineered hardware systems. (Great Britain and Health and Safety Executive, 1992)
	•	there are at present important limits on the extent to which computer software is relied upon for safety-critical functions in nuclear reactors. (Great Britain and Health and Safety Executive, 1992)
Safety engineering 
	•	The major principles of safety engineering all have one important trait in common: they aim at protecting us not only against risks (in the technical sense) but also against hazards that cannot be assigned meaningful probability estimates, such as the possibility that some unforeseen event triggers a hazard that is seemingly under control. (Swedish Chemicals Agency et al., 2007)
Safety factors
	•	In engineering design, constructions are usually made strong enough to resist loads and disturbances exceeding those that are intended. A common way to obtain such safety reserves is to employ explicitly chosen, numerical safety factors. (Swedish Chemicals Agency et al., 2007)
	•	Safety factors have been used in structural mechanics since the 1860s. In regulatory toxicology, safety factors have been used since the 1940s. (Swedish Chemicals Agency et al., 2007)
	•	a safety factor is defined as the ratio between an experimentally determined dose and a dose that is accepted in humans in a particular regulatory context. (Swedish Chemicals Agency et al., 2007)
Safety requirement
	•	A “safety requirement” level needs to be met before the system goes into use; a “safety target” level is an input to the design process and is the level that will be achieved if the design process works well. (Cook, 2008)
	•	These terms can relate to quantitative or qualitative measures of the system. With qualitative measures (for example: the end of the train shall be coloured yellow for visibility) there may be no difference between the requirement and the target. However for quantitative measures (such as the level of risk, with which we are more concerned in this paper) the two should differ. (Cook, 2008)
Saintliness
	•	the appearance of saintliness never goes out of fashion. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Appearing saintly today is certainly different in content from the sixteenth century, but the essence is the same—you embody what is considered good and above reproach. In the modern world, this means showing yourself as progressive, supremely tolerant, and open-minded. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Projecting sincerity and honesty always plays well. A few public confessions of your weaknesses and vulnerabilities will do the trick. For some reason people see signs of humility as authentic, even though people might very well be simulating them. Learn how to occasionally lower your head and appear humble. If dirty work must be done, get others to do it. Your hands are clean. Never overtly play the Machiavellian leader—that only works well on television. Use the appropriate dominance cues to make people think you are powerful, even before you reach the heights. You want to seem like you were destined for success, a mystical effect that always works. (Greene, 2018)
	•	These people are paragons of goodness and purity. They support the best and most progressive causes. They can be very spiritual if that is the circle they travel in; or they are above the corruption and compromises of politics; or they have endless compassion for every type of victim. This saintly exterior developed early on as a way to disguise their strong hunger for power and attention or their strong sensual appetites. The irony is that often by projecting this saintly aura to the nth degree they will gain great power, leading a cult or political party. And once they are in power, the Shadow will have space to operate. They will become intolerant, railing at the impure, punishing them if necessary. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Maximilien Robespierre (nicknamed the Incorruptible), who rose to power in the French Revolution, was just such a type. Under his reign, the guillotine was never busier. (Greene, 2018)
	•	They are also secretly drawn to sex, to money, to the limelight, and to what is expressly taboo for their particular saintliness. The strain and the temptations are too much—they are the gurus who sleep with their students. They will appear the saint in public, but their family or spouse will see the demonic side in private. (See the story of the Tolstoys in chapter 2.) There are genuine saints out there, but they do not feel the need to publicize their deeds or grab power. (Greene, 2018)
	•	To distinguish between the real and the fake, ignore their words and the aura they project, focusing on their deeds and the details of their life—how much they seem to enjoy power and attention, the astonishing degree of wealth they have accumulated, the number of mistresses, the level of self-absorption. Once you recognize this type, do not become a naive follower. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Keep some distance. If they are enemies, simply shine a light on the clear signs of hypocrisy.As a variation on this, you will find people who propound a philosophy of free love and anything goes; but in fact they are after power. They prefer sex with those who are dependent on them. And of course anything goes, as long as it’s on their terms. (Greene, 2018)
Salemen
	•	Salesmen and demagogues play on this weakness in human nature to con us with the prospect of easy gains and instant gratification. (Greene, 2018)
Salon
Tradition of salons
	•	gatherings where people of like mind discussed literary and philosophical ideas. (Greene, 2014)
Sample
Insensitivity to sample size
	•	Insensitivity to sample size. To evaluate the probability of obtaining a particular result in a sample drawn from a specified population, people typically apply the representativeness heuristic. (Tversky and Kahneman, 1974)
	•	The similarity of a sample statistic to a population parameter does not depend on the size of the sample. Consequently, if probabilities are assessed by representativeness, then the judged probability of a sample statistic will be essentially independent of sample size. Indeed, when subjects assessed t h e distributions of average height for samples of various sizes, they produced identical distributions. (Tversky and Kahneman, 1974)

Sampling strategies
	•	Accurate sampling strategies are also important in occupational risk assessment where time-weighted aver- age samples collected over the entire work day, rather than those collected over shorter periods, are known to be the best way to assess the chronic inhalation hazard. (Paustenbach, 2002c)
	•	Not only is it important in nearly any risk assessment that samples be collected in a random or representative manner, but the number of samples should be sufficient to conduct a statistically valid analysis. The number needed to ensure statistical validity will be dictated by the variability of the data. The larger the variance, the greater the number of samples needed to define the extent of contamination. (Paustenbach, 2002c)
Sand dune
	•	sand dunes exhibit striking patterns, a sign that symmetries may lurk somewhere nearby. (Stewart, 2013)
	•	Geologists classify dunes into six main types: longitudinal, transverse, barchanoid, barchan, parabolic, and star. (Stewart, 2013)
	•	Symmetries don’t just let us organize these patterns. They help us to understand how they arise; see Figure 44. Sand dunes are typical of many pattern-forming systems in mathematical physics, and they exemplify a general, powerful way of thinking about these systems. The key idea is known as symmetry breaking. At first sight it seems to violate Curie’s principle (see Chapter 2), because the observed state has less symmetry than its cause does. However, a tiny asymmetric perturbation is required to create this state, so technically Curie is correct. (Stewart, 2013)
Sarbanes-Oxley
	•	Sarbanes-Oxley aims to put an end to that ‘‘strategic ignorance’’ across the board by holding most senior managers responsible for their companies’ false or misleading financial data. (Michaels, 2008)
Savant
	•	apprendre n'est pas savoir ; il y a les sachant et les savants : c'est la mémoire qui fait les uns, c'est la philosophie qui fait les autres.– Mais ne peut-on apprendre la philosophie  ? – La philosophie ne s'apprend pas ; la philosophie est la réunion des sciences acquises au génie qui les applique : la philosophie , c'est le nuage éclatant sur lequel le Christ a posé le pied pour remonter au ciel. (Dumas, 1998)
Scales (international relations)
	•	Scales have to be proposed, practised and made self-evident. (Bubandt, 2005)
	•	Scales are contested political projects – political kinds of fact-making. (Bubandt, 2005)
Scales (methodology)
	•	A scale may be as simple as low, medium, and high and has the advantage of easy interpretation as interval steps. (Newsome, 2013)

Exposure
Exposure assessment
	•	Exposure assessment is the process wherein the intensity. frequency, and duration of human exposure to an agent are estimated. The process may also address the exposure of wildlife to chemical agents. (Paustenbach, 2002c)
	•	An exposure assessment should quantitatively estimate the magnitude (size) of the exposed population, the routes of entry, and the uncertainties in the exposure estimates. (Paustenbach, 2002c) 

Exposure scenarios
	•	exposure scenarios are just that—hypothetical situations based on combinations of measured and, where data are unavailable, modeled estimates of the form and amount of a chemical in the environment or human tissue. They often combine data specific to the chemical at issue and, where such data are not available, data on similar chemicals or on the same chemical in different conditions. (National Research Council (U.S.) et al., 2009)
Exposure information
	•	Exposure information needed for risk assessment and characterization include estimated intakes of chemicals by route of entry, important exposure modeling assumptions and reasonable or likely exposure pathways (EPA, 1989a). (Williams and Paustenbach, 2002)
Scaling
	•	Scaling is a property related to self-similarity, suggesting a new way to examine CPS and complexity in general. (Holland, 2014)
Scan
Environmental scan
	•	So-called `environmental scanning' and `environmental analysis' (although many may use alternative terminology) are considered such a fundamental and basic part of the business planning process that the need to carry them out is accepted without question. (Pickton and Wright, 1998)
Scandal
	•	Le scandale commence là ou la norme finit. (Mannoni, 1985)
Scenario
	•	Intelligence analysts sometimes present judgments in the form of a scenario—a series of events leading to an anticipated outcome. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	There is evidence that judgments concerning the probability of a scenario are influenced by amount and nature of detail in the scenario in a way that is unrelated to actual likelihood of the scenario. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	A scenario consists of several events linked together in a narrative description. To calculate mathematically the probability of a scenario, the proper procedure is to multiply the probabilities of each individual event. (Heuer, 1999)
Scenario planning
	•	In the 1970s, scenario planning gained prominence as a strategic management tool. Scenario planning encourages managers to envision plausible future states of the world and consider how to take advantage of opportunities and avoid potential threats. (Miller and Waller, 2003)
	•	Scenario planning has a long history in strategic management research and practice. Its development was closely associated with the rise of strategic planning and, more generally, the emergence of the field of strategic management. (Miller and Waller, 2003)
	•	Scenario planning is a qualitative method. (Miller and Waller, 2003)
	•	During a scenario planning process, participants discuss current trends and future prospects arising in a firm’s external environment. They create coherent stories about possible futures. Managers exercise their judgment by distilling the myriad possible future states of the world to the most plausible few. (Miller and Waller, 2003)
	•	Through scenario planning, the contingencies, uncertainties, trends, and opportunities that are often unanticipated can be identified, evaluated and acted upon. (Miller and Waller, 2003)
	•	Scenario planning dates back to the Manhattan Project when scientists, aided by computer simula- tions, tried to predict the effects of exploding an atomic bomb. (Miller and Waller, 2003)
	•	During the 1990s, strategy was increasingly viewed as central to managerial decision making—even within functional areas. (Miller and Waller, 2003)
	•	Scenario planning factors in a wide range of variables, many of which are not easily quantified. The process consists of interactive discussions among managers, with input from other key organizational stakeholders. (Miller and Waller, 2003)
	•	Planning sessions explore the complexities and dynamics of the business landscape and possible future states of the world, which spring logically from a firm’s current position. Once the range of infinite possibilities can be distilled to the most plausible few, managers can devise strategic initiatives that reduce the risk posed by key uncertainties and exploit the opportunities identified. (Miller and Waller, 2003)
	•	Scenario planning is a process for structured thinking in which stories are created that bring together factual data and human insight to create scenario ‘plots’ exploring possible futures. Unlike fanciful dreaming, scenario planning relies on a rigorous exploration of the scenario plots. Through structured story creation, planners combine the world of facts and the world of perceptions to expand beyond preconceived ideas of how environmental contingencies should unfold, while staying within the bounds of believability. It is this combination of factual data, intuition, and creativity that leads to a few most plausible, internally consistent scenarios. Managers can identify risks and opportunities within scenarios, and test their generalisability across scenarios. (Miller and Waller, 2003)
	•	Scenario planning reflects some assumptions widely shared by strategic management theorists and practitioners. (Miller and Waller, 2003)
Probability of a scenario
	•	To calculate mathematically the probability of a scenario, the proper procedure is to multiply the probabilities of each individual event. (Heuer, 1999)
Schema
	•	A schema is a collection of stored knowledge associated with a concept. (Honig, 2007)
	•	schemas, once formed, are relatively resistant to change. (Honig, 2007)
	•	One useful concept of memory organization is what some cognitive psychologists call a “schema.” A schema is any pattern of relationships among data stored in memory. It is any set of nodes and links between them in the spider web of memory that hang together so strongly that they can be retrieved and used more or less as a single unit. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	People also have schemata (plural for schema) for abstract concepts such as a socialist economic system and what distinguishes it from a capitalist or communist system. Schemata for phenomena such as success or failure in making an accurate intelligence estimate will include links to those elements of memory that explain typical causes and implications of success or failure. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	There must also be schemata for processes that link memories of the various steps involved in long division, regression analysis, or simply making inferences from evidence and writing an intelligence report. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Concepts and schemata stored in memory exercise a powerful influence on the formation of perceptions from sensory data. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	The content of schemata in memory is a principal factor distinguishing stronger from weaker analytical ability. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Schemata that were valid yesterday may no longer be functional tomorrow. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Learning new schemata often requires the unlearning of existing ones, and this is exceedingly difficult. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	It is always easier to learn a new habit than to unlearn an old one. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Schemata in long-term memory that are so essential to effective analysis are also the principal source of inertia in recognizing and adapting to a changing environment. (Heuer, 1999)
Schema theory
	•	Schema theory predicts that the schema holder would try to assimilate discrepant information into the existing schema or dismiss it as unimportant or incredible. (Honig, 2007)
	•	schemas encourage theory-driven thinking and prevent complete openness to new information. (Honig, 2007)
Chadenfreude
	•	chadenfreude the experience of pleasure in the pain of other people, is distinctly related to envy, as several studies have demonstrated. (Greene, 2018)
	•	This means that instead of merely congratulating people on their good fortune, something easy to do and easily forgotten, you must instead actively try to feel their joy, as a form of empathy. This can be somewhat unnatural, as our first tendency is to feel a pang of envy, but we can train ourselves to imagine how it must feel to others to experience their happiness or satisfaction. (Greene, 2018)
Science
	•	Science is not one thing. And it does not need defending; it needs debating (Stilgoe et al., 2006) 
	•	Science is comfortable with universal statements expressed without obvious emotion or personality (Stilgoe et al., 2006)
	•	Science provides a sense of wonder not just from revealing the world, but also from showing that the world can be revealed. (Fischhoff, 2013)
	•	The more that people know about a science (e.g., physics), the easier it will be to explain the facts that matter in specific decisions (e.g., energy policy). The more that people know about the scientific process, per se, the easier it will be for science communications to explain the uncertainties and controversies that science inevitably produces. (Fischhoff, 2013)
	•	Science is a matter of voting, directly as experts debate, or indirectly as they adopt, refine, or ignore putative "facts". (Lowrance, 1980)
	•	science is also becoming more like accounting in that it is increasingly and inextricably linked to commerce. The separation between academic science and the business world is disappearing. As a result, the whole culture of science is changing rapidly. (Michaels, 2008)
	•	science does not consist of the accumulation of information. It is a way of thinking, of approaching problems. (Greene, 2014)
	•	Our knowledge of the world is limited, despite the advances of science. Our ideas are conditioned by the prejudices instilled in us by our parents, by our culture, and by the historical period we live in. They are further limited by the increasing rigidity of the mind. A bit more humility about what we know would make us all more curious and interested in a wider range of ideas. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Science is a patchwork, and some of the seams admit draughts. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
	•	Science as it should be, third-world science, agrees with the proscribed rules. Science as we actually find it in history is a com- bination of such rules and of error. It follows that the scientist who works in a particular historical situation must learn how to recognize error and how to live with it, always keeping in mind that he himself is liable to add fresh error at any stage of the investigation. He needs a theory of error in addition to the "certain and infallible" rules which define the "approach to the truth." (Feyerabend, 1993)
	•	Science gives us theories of high beauty and sophistication. (Feyerabend, 1993)
	•	The idea that science can and should be run according to some fixed rules, and that its rationality consists in agreement with such rules, is both unrealistic and vicious. It is unrealistic, since it takes too simple a view of the talents of men and of the circumstances which encourage, or cause, their development. And it is vicious, since the attempt to enforce the rules will undoubtedly erect barriers to what men might have been, and will reduce our humanity by increasing our professional qualifications. (Feyerabend, 1993)
	•	One of the most important properties of modern science, at least according to some of its admirers, is its universality: any question can be attacked in a scientific way leading either to an unambiguous answer or else to an explanation of why an answer cannot be had. (Feyerabend, 1993)
Scientific entreprise
	•	The scientific enterprise requires interpretation of results and often the synthesis of the results of many studies. It looks for the weight of the evidence, so the policies science shapes are driven by interpretations and syntheses rather than by the data directly. (Michaels, 2008)
Scientific spirit
	•	The scientific spirit is creative. (Greene, 2014)
Citizen science
	•	Citizen Science is the term coined by him for the arena where different knowledge claims can meet and cross-fertilize. In this arena science has engage with situations that give rise to citizen concerns and engage with non-scientifically generated understanding and expertise. (Boholm, 2011)
	•	[…] citizen science is not only a challenge for science, but also for the wider society. It is a challenge for all people to establish a framework for expanded dialogue between different categories of people and to scrutinise different knowledge claims. (Boholm, 2011)
	•	In Citizen Science local knowledge is seen as closely related to living; people live in specific places, a fact which largely influences their understanding of environmental problems. Their contextually generated knowledge is highly practical, case-specific, instrumental in orientation and has no claim to universal status. (Boholm, 2011)
	•	The public is no lay community, but a highly knowledgeable community embroiled in networks of alliances and forming hybrid groups. Furthermore, the risks currently challenging the public are in no way local, but to a large degree of global character. (Boholm, 2011)
	•	The implication of their perspective is that ‘the public’ and ‘science’ cease to exist as distinct entities, and are replaced by assemblages, coalitions, and hybrid groups which deliver statements that weave in and out of the expert and lay domains. (Boholm, 2011)
	•	Citizen science makes a number of arguments for public inclusion and how this inclusion should be designed to enable a cross-fertilisation between different knowledges. (Boholm, 2011)
Communication science
	•	At the social level, the success of scientists’ communication depends on their awareness of the role that their work plays in the public discourse. (Fischhoff and Scheufele, 2013)
	•	if scientists want to be effective in their communication, they must understand and address the perspectives of interest groups, policy makers, businesses, and other players in debates over decisions that require scientific expertise. (Fischhoff and Scheufele, 2013)
	•	Making the most of what science has to offer society requires the give- and-take of two-way communication with laypeople. Those interactions can be direct, as in classrooms and social settings, or in- direct, through the mediation of research helping scientists to understand the public and vice versa. (Fischhoff and Scheufele, 2013)
	•	Just as there is science to be communicated, there is a science of communication. Indeed, there are many sciences of communication. (Fischhoff and Scheufele, 2013)
	•	the communication of science is held to the same evidentiary standards as the science being communicated. It should be informed by existing science (e.g., studies of how to avoid confusion between correlation and causality), rather than just intuition. (Fischhoff and Scheufele, 2013) 
	•	Effective science communications inform people about the benefits, risks, and other costs of their decisions, thereby allowing them to make sound choices. (Fischhoff, 2013)
	•	The goal of science communication is not agreement, but fewer, better disagreements. 
	•	Because science communication seeks to inform decision making, it must begin by listening to its audience, to identify the decisions that its members face—and, therefore, the information. (Fischhoff, 2013)
	•	Because science communication seeks to inform decision making, it must begin by listening to its audience, to identify the decisions that its members face—and, therefore, the information that they need. (Fischhoff, 2013)
	•	Science communications that fulfill this mission must perform four interrelated tasks: Task 1: Identify the science most relevant to the decisions that people face. Task 2: Determine what people already know. Task 3: Design communications to fill the critical gaps (between what people know and need to know). Task 4: Evaluate the adequacy of those communications. (Fischhoff, 2013)
Communication scientists
	•	Communication scientists know something about how messages flow through diverse communications channels, how stakeholders interpret them, and how those processes affect beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors about science and scientists. (Fischhoff and Scheufele, 2013)
Science of science communication
	•	[…] is simply to do the science of science communication — to show what it means to approach the science communication paradox scientifically. (Kahan, 2015)
	•	The most popular explanation for the science communication paradox can be called the “public irrationality thesis” or “PIT.” (Kahan, 2015)
	•	The science of science communication provides guidance on how to create the content for such processes (109–111). (Fischhoff, 2015)
History of science
	•	The history of science, after all, consists not only of facts and conclusions drawn there- from. It consists also of ideas, interpretations of facts, problems created by a clash of interpretations, actions of scientists, and so on. On closer analysis we even find that there are no "bare facts" at all but that the facts that enter our knowledge are already viewed in a certain way and are therefore essentially ideational. This being the case the history of science will be as complex, as chaotic, as full of error, and as entertain- ing as the ideas it contains and these ideas in turn will be as complex, as chaotic, as full of error, and as entertaining as are the minds of those who invented them. Conversely, a little brainwashing will go a long way in making the history of science more simple, more uniform, more dull, more "objective," and more accessible to treatment by "certain and infallible" rules: a theory of errors is superfluous when we are dealing with well-trained scientists who are kept in place by an internal slave mastercalled "professional conscience" and who have been convinced that it is good and rewarding to attain, and then to forever keep, one's "professional integrity." (Feyerabend, 1993)
Modern science
	•	Modern science has developed mathematical structures which exceed anything that has existed so far in coherence and generality. But in order to achieve this miracle all the existing troubles had to be pushed into the relation between theory and fact, and had to be concealed, by ad hoc approximations, and by other procedures. (Feyerabend, 1993)
Normal science
	•	Traditional, disciplinary science is ‘normal science’ in the Kuhnian sense, a puzzle-solving activity within an unquestioned and implicated paradigm. (Boholm, 2011)
Postnormal science
	•	Traditional science cannot provide relevant knowledge for guiding action in the face of these new hazards where extreme uncertainty is combined with the possibility of prolonged, and often even irreversible harm. (Boholm, 2011)
	•	[…] when approaching these new kinds of hazards, the knowledge that normal science produces is insufficient. (Boholm, 2011)
	•	Technical catastrophes such as Seveso, Bhopal, and Chernobyl have become powerful symbols of the pathologies of our technological civilisation. Postnormal Science – a concept introduced by Jerome Ravetz and Silvio Funtowicz – emerged as a response to this awareness (Funtowicz and Ravetz 1990, 1993; Ravets and Funtowicz 1998; Ravetz 1999; De Marchi and Ravetz 1999). Thus, in contrast to the New Production of Knowledge, it is not the development of a knowledge society that serves as the foundation for recent changes in science, but instead the new characteristics of industrial risks. (Boholm, 2011)
	•	This situation – high system uncertainty and high decision stakes – constitutes the basis for the development of what Funtowicz and Ravetz call ‘Postnormal Science’. This involves better cooperation between disciplines, but foremost concerns an opening up towards other kinds of knowledge claims. The way to bridge the guld between the world of the laboratory and the world of society is through public inclusion, where groups other than scientists are welcome to take part in the process of knowledge production. Extended peer communities constituted by citizens, environmental movements, and political organization should be formed to judge the quality and relevance of research. (Boholm, 2011)
	•	Local knowledge is accorded special importance. The reason for this is that contextually generated knowledge about local circumstances is often more relevant to action than traditional, universal, abstract, and ‘context-independent’ scientific statements. Local knowledge and personal experience can create a unique and important body of knowledge on environmental problems, something which science lacks. (Boholm, 2011)
	•	Postnornal Science makes a strong plea for the greater involvement of stakeholders in knowledge production. The reason for this is that we need to understand the contextual character of a problem if \'Je are ta solve it. This has severl implications for the relationship between experts and lay people. First, Postnormal Science tries to explain the political and social dimensions of scientific practice without reducing it to politic. The reasons for including stakeholders and the public are not only expressed in terms of democracy and justice, but also knowledge and quality. Secondly, it explains why science is necessary but not sufficient for solving many problems. Thirdly, it provides a changed role for the expertise: from producing facts to providing testimonies. Fourthly, whereas New Production of Knowledge primarily opens science up for ‘semi-scientific knowledges’ – knowledge that is possible to gain for those who have an academic training – Postnormal Science has a much broader approach, where all kinds of categories of people and organisation are welcome to enrich the process of knowledge production. (Boholm, 2011)
	•	Whereas New Production of Knowledge invites a part of the public – the well-educated – to play a leading role alongside science, Postnormal Science welcomes broader categories of people, but only gives them a supporting role; their task is to enrich the traditional production of scientific knowledge. (Boholm, 2011)
	•	[…] Postnormal Science’s realistic account of risk – risks are not socially constructed, but reflect certain characteristics of a world external to people. (Boholm, 2011)
Scientific advice
	•	Scientific advice is valued less for the authority it wields than for the options it gives policy-makers. (Stilgoe et al., 2006)
Science education
	•	science education begins by listening to scientists and learning the facts that they wish to convey. (Fischhoff, 2013)
	•	Science education provides the foundation for science communication. (Fischhoff, 2013)
Scientific education 
	•	Scientific education as we know it today has precisely this purpose. It has the purpose of carrying out a rationalistic simplification of the proc-ess "science" by simplifying its participants. One proceeds as follows. First,a domain of research is defined. Next, the domain is separated from theremainder of history (physics, for example, is separated from metaphys-ics and from theology) and receives a "logic" of its own. A thoroughtraining in such a logic then conditions those working in the domainso that they may not unwittingly disturb the purity (read: the sterility) that has already been achieved. An essential part of the training is theinhibition of intuitions that might lead to a blurring of boundaries. A person's religion, for example, or his metaphysics, or his sense of humormust not have the slightest connection with his scientific ai;;tivity. Hisimagination is restrained and even his language will cease to be his own. (Feyerabend, 1993)
	•	It is obvious that such an education, such a cutting up of domains and of consciousness, cannot be easily reconciled with a humanitarian attitude. It is in conflict “with the cultivation of individuality which [alone] produces, or can produce well developed human beings"; it "maim[s] by compression, like a Chinese lady's foot, every part of human nature which stands out prominently, and tends to make a person markedly dissimilar in outline" from the ideal of rationality that happens to be fashionable with the methodologists. (Feyerabend, 1993)
Scientific community
	•	The scientific community owes individual scientists the support needed for scientifically sound communication. (Fischhoff, 2013)
	•	recognize full weil that scientists define their own "community", that this community is self-perpetuating, that it sets its own rules, and that the very essence ofscience is to pursue its orthodoxies so hard, to extend them further and further, that those orthodoxies take a pratfall and have to be replaced. (Lowrance, 1980)
Junk science
	•	‘‘Junk science is the mirror image of real science, with much of the same form but none of the substance. . . . It is a hodgepodge of biased data, spurious inference, and logical legerdemain. . . . It is a catalog of every conceivable kind of error: data dredging, wishful thinking, truculent dogmatism, and, now and again, outright fraud.’ (Michaels, 2008)
Sound science
	•	The opposite of junk science is, of course, ‘‘sound science.’’. (Michaels, 2008)
Public health science 
	•	In public health science, absolute certainty is rarely an option because the questions our regulatory system asks can be answered only imperfectly in most cases. (Michaels, 2008)
Scientific
	•	To be scientific means to pursue truth in the form of (repeatedly demonstrable) reliably correct answers derived from application of correct theory to specified problems. (Gray, 2014)
	•	Science as it should be, third-world science, agrees with the proscribed rules. Science as we actually find it in history is a com- bination of such rules and of error. It follows that the scientist who works in a particular historical situation must learn how to recognize error and how to live with it, always keeping in mind that he himself is liable to add fresh error at any stage of the investigation. He needs a theory of error in addition to the "certain and infallible" rules which define the "approach to the truth." (Feyerabend, 1993)
Scientific concepts
	•	Scientific concepts have traditionally been communicated as isolated ideas in a way that may not be particularly meaningful to public audiences. (Downs, 2014)
Scientific corpus
	•	The corpus can, roughly, be described as consisting of those statements that could, at the time being, legitimately be made without reservation in a (sufficiently detailed) textbook. Alternatively it can be described as consisting in that which is taken for given by the collective of researchers in our continued research, and thus not questioned unless new data give us reason to do so. (Swedish Chemicals Agency et al., 2007).
	•	The corpus is constantly updated. (Swedish Chemicals Agency et al., 2007)
Scientific investigation
	•	Scientific investigation, says Popper, starts with a problem, and it proceeds by solving it. (Feyerabend, 1993)
Scientific judgment
	•	A scientific judgment determines whether an analysis considers just physical processes affecting the outcomes (e.g., valve failures and toxic plumes) or also human factors (e.g., how well workers operate equipment or how faithfully patients take medications). (Fischhoff, 2015)
	•	Exercising scientific judgment when gathering and interpreting evidence is a task faced by both analysts and scientists. (Fischhoff, 2015)
Scientific knowledge
	•	Scientific knowledge begins with data from experiments and other observations. Through a process of critical assessment, these data give rise to the scientific corpus. (Swedish Chemicals Agency et al., 2007)
	•	But scientific knowledge is not only developed for its own sake. It is also used to guide decisions. Whenever it does, we must be careful to distinguish between the practical decision to be guided by science and the scientific process itself. (Swedish Chemicals Agency et al., 2007)
Scientific observation
	•	The physicists, earth scientists, economists, and other scientists do not know the rule, the full Laws of Nature, relevant to the physical systems of scientific study. And scientific observations are not perfect; they may be invariably uncertain due to observational noise noise, but that is not the end of the story. It is a capital mistake to confuse real observations with those of these mathematical games.). (Smith and Smith, 2007)
Scientists
	•	Scientists do not have the truth; we seek the truth. We deal not in absolute certainties but in the ‘‘weight of the evidence.’’ We combine and evaluate information from many sources, and we apply both quantitative and qualitative methods in order to overcome real uncertainty and gaps in scientific knowledge. (Michaels, 2008)
	•	Scientists must thus extrapolate from the evidence to make causal inferences and recommend protective measures. (Michaels, 2008)
	•	The scientist seeks to disprove a hypothesis, not to confirm it. A hypothesis is accepted only when it cannot be rejected. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Doing so, such researchers would be rewarded with articles in prestigious journals and solid positions within academia. But in the end they would remain on the outside looking in, and a good portion of their conclusions would simply be confirmations of what they had already assumed. (Greene, 2014)
	•	Part of this predilection for the outside perspective originates from a prejudice among scientists. Studying from the outside, man would say, preserves our objectivity. But what kind of objectivity is  when researcher’s perspective is tainted by so many assumption and pre-digested theories? How much more can we see by moving inside and participating in this alien culture? This does not taint us with subjectivity. A scientists can participate from within and yet retain his or her reasoning powers. The intuitive and the rational, the inside perspective and science, can easily coexist. (Greene, 2014)
	•	Scientists’ work almost always builds on previous results. Researchers recognize this by citing several older publications at the end of their papers. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
Climate scientists
	•	Climate scientists use graphical displays to show the relative importance of different physical contributions to global warming, together with the uncertainty associated with each contribution. In order to create this display, researchers first identify each separate physical phenomenon thought to contribute to global warming, and use mathematical models to express that contribution as a ‘‘radiative forcing,’’ i.e., a positive or negative power density over the surface of the Earth. (Weiss, 2008)

Secondary prevention
	•	secondary prevention that consists in reducing the risk associated with a hazard. (Swedish Chemicals Agency et al., 2007)
	•	Secondary prevention can consist in reducing either the probability or the consequences of an adverse event, such as an accident in which the hazard is realized. (Swedish Chemicals Agency et al., 2007)
	•	Secondary prevention would consist in removing or isolating sources of ignition and/or installing fire-extinguishing equipment. (Swedish Chemicals Agency et al., 2007)
Scientific method
	•	Scientific method, for its part, requires that one seek to disprove hypotheses rather than confirm them. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Scientific method is based on the principle of rejecting hypotheses, while tentatively accepting only those hypotheses that cannot be refuted. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Now it is precisely such an ideal that finds expression either in "certain and infallible rules" or else in standards which separate what is cor- rect, or rational, or reasonable, or "objective" from what is incorrect, or irrational, or unreasonable, or "subjective." Abandoning the ideal as be- ing unworthy of a free man means abandoning standards and relying on theories of error entirely. Only these theories, these ,hints, these rules of thumb must now be renamed. Without universally enforced standards oftruth and rationality we can no longer speak of universal error. We can only speak of what does, or does not, seem appropriate when viewed from a particular and restricted point of view, different views, tempera- ments, attitudes giving rise to different judgments and different meth- ods of approach. Such an anarchistic epistemology-for this is what our theories of error now turn out to be-is not only a better means for improving knowledge, or of understanding history. It is also more appropriate for a free man to use than are its rigorous and "scientific" alternatives. (Feyerabend, 1993)
	•	The idea of a method that contains firm, unchanging, and absolutely binding principles for conducting the business of science gets into considerable difficulty when confronted with the results of historical research. We find, then, that there is not a single rule, however plausible, and however firmly grounded in epistemology, that is not violated at some time or other. It becomes evident that such violations are not accidental events, they are not the results of insufficient knowledge or of inatten- tion which might have been avoided. On the contrary, we see that they are necessary for progress. Indeed, one of the most striking features of recent discussions in the history and philosophy of science is the reali- zation that developments such as the Copernican Revolutions, or the rise of atomism in antiquity and recently (kinetic theory; dispersion theory; stereochemistry; quantum theory), or the gradual emergence of the wave theory of light occurred either because some thinkers decided not to be bound by certain "obvious" methodological rules or because they unwittingly broke them. (Feyerabend, 1993)
	•	cientific method is part of a general theory of man. It receives its rules from this theory and is built up in accordance with our ideas of a worthwhile human existence. (Feyerabend, 1993)
Scientific practice
	•	The difference between epistemological (political, theological) theory and scientific (political, religious) practice that emerges from these quotations is usually formulated as a difference between "certain and infallible" (or, at any rate, clear, systematic, and objective) rules, or standards, and "our fallible and uncertain faculties [which] depart from them and fall into error." (Feyerabend, 1993)
Scientific research
	•	like most intelligence analysis, most scientific research is concerned with filling gaps in existing paradigms; revolutionary concepts require years to become established. In principle, this derives from the dictum that ‘‘extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.’’ In practice, scientists’ judgment regarding the quality of evidence often depends on how closely it fits their preconceptions. Abandonment of a fundamental paradigm may owe as much to the death or retirement of an older generation of scientists as to the success of the new model in winning them over. (Weiss, 2008)
Scientist
Environmental scientist
	•	Environmental scientists are particularly alert to possible surprises, and emphasize research on indicators that could be the first signs of more serious environmental damage than would be predicted by the hypothesis deemed most likely in a particular situation. (Weiss, 2008)
School
School performance
	•	Many surveys and laboratory experiments have shown that people generally perceive their own actions as the cause of their successes but not of their failures. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	When children or students or workers perform well, their parents, teachers, or supervisors take at least part of the credit; when they do poorly, their mentors seldom assume any blame. (Heuer, 1999)
Sea food
	•	Déjà couraient autour de la table les saucissons d'Arles à la chair brune et au fumet accentué, les langoustes à la cuirasse éblouissante, les praires à la coquille rosée, les oursins, qui semblent des châtaignes entourées de leur enveloppe piquante, les clovisses, qui ont la prétention de remplacer avec supériorité, pour les gourmets du Midi, les huîtres du Nord ; enfin tous ces hors-d'oeuvre délicats que la vague roule sur sa rive sablonneuse, et que les pécheurs reconnaissants désignent sous le nom générique de fruits de mer. (Dumas, 1998)
Sect
	•	La secte marque le premier degré dans l'organisation des foules homogènes. Elle comprend des individus d'éducation, de professions, de milieux parfois fort différents, n'ayant entre eux que le lien unique des croyances. Telles sont les sectes religieuses et politiques, par exemple. (Lebon, 1895)
Sector
	•	sectors mean something analytically significant. (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	the entire division of social andother sciences into disciplines is based largely on a preference for thinkingin terms of sectors—a practice reflected in the general discourse, whichoften assumes that economy, society, and politics can somehow be separaed without thinking too hard about how to do so. Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	One way of looking at sectors is to see them as identifying specifictypes of interaction. (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	If a multisectoralapproach to security was to be fully meaningful, referent objects other thanthe state had to be allowed into the picture. (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	Sectors might identify distinctive patterns, but they remain inseparable parts of complex wholes. The purpose of selecting them is simply toreduce complexity to facilitate analysis. (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	The use of sectors confines the scope of inquiry to more manageable proportions by reducing the number of variables in play. (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	Each islooking at the whole but is seeing only one dimension of its reality. (Buzan et al., 1997)
Military sector
	•	In this view, the military sector is about relationshipsof forceful coercion. (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	The military strategist looks at the systems in terms that highlightoffensive and defensive capability and justify restrictive assumptions, suchas the motivation of behavior by opportunistic calculations of coerciveadvantage. (Buzan et al., 1997)
Political sector
	•	the political sector is about relationships of authority,governing status, and recognition. (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	The political realist looks at the same systems in terms that highlight sovereignty and power and justify restrictiveassumptions, such as the motivation of behavior by the desire to maximizepower. (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	political sectors, provides additional justification for classical, state-centric security complex theory and also gives us clues about how tobegin thinking about security relations in other sectors. (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	In the political sector, existential threats are traditionally defined interms of the constituting principle—sovereignty, but sometimes also ideology—of the state. Sovereignty can be existentially threatened by anythingthat questions recognition, legitimacy, or governing authority. (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	political sector around international society or democracy (the latteras an extension of the democracy = peace hypothesis). (Buzan et al., 1997)

Economic sector
	•	the economic sector is about relation-ships of trade, production, and finance; the societal sector is about relationships of collective identity. (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	the economist looks at human systems in terms that highlight wealth and develop-ment and justify restrictive assumptions, such as the motivation of behaviorby the desire to maximize utility. (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	in the economic sector, units such as firms and criminalgangs may be highly mobile. (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	In the economic sector, the referent objects and existential threats aremore difficult to pin down. (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	In the economic sector, system-level referents may bemore effective vehicles for security discourse than limited collectivities,such as the firm and the state. (Buzan et al., 1997)

Environmental sector
	•	the environmental sector is about relationships between human activity and the planetary biosphere. (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	The environmentalist looks at systems in terms of the ecologicalunderpinnings of civilization and the need to achieve sustainable development. (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	In the environmental sector, the range of possible referent objects isvery large, ranging from relatively concrete things, such as the survival ofindividual species (tigers, whales, humankind) or types of habitat (rainforests, lakes), to much fuzzier, larger-scale issues, such as maintenance ofthe planetary climate and biosphere within the narrow band human beingshave come to consider to be normal during their few thousand years of civilization. (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	Underlying many of these referent objects are baseline concernsabout the relationship between the human species and the rest of the biosphere and whether that relationship can be sustained without risking a collapse of the achieved levels of civilization, a wholesale disruption of theplanet's biological legacy, or both. (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	The interplay among all of these factorsis immensely complicated. (Buzan et al., 1997)

Societal sector
	•	In the societal sector, for example, one might expect units such as nations to display immobility logic similar to that of states and thus to find regional formationsamong them. (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	In the societal sector, the analyst looks at the systems in terms of pat-terns of identity and the desire to maintain cultural independence. (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	In the societal sector, as we have defined it, the referent object is large-scale collective identities that can function independent of the state, such as nations and religions. (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	Collective identities naturally evolve andchange in response to internal and external developments. (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	The abilities to maintain and reproduce a lan-guage, a set of behavioral customs, or a conception of ethnic purity can allbe cast in terms of survival. (Buzan et al., 1997)

Secret
	•	Secrets are sets of facts that are capable of being known provided that the intelligence apparatus is sufficiently sensitive to detect the information, and to avoid being misled or deceived by the opponent. (Omand, 2014)
Secret garden
	•	Sa pensée intérieure non exprimée au-dehors nous semble être le seul refuge où sa personnalité soit à l’abri de l’investigation et de la pression des autres ». (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	l’intériorisation des interdits ou à l’introjection des modèles. (Mannoni, 1985)
Security
	•	‘security’ is what actors make it, and it is for the analyst to map these practices. (Buzan and Wæver, 2003)
	•	Security is in this sense a particular kind of fact and scale-making. (Bubandt, 2005)
	•	I suggest that security as a political way of dealing with the ontological issue of uncertainty produces these different scales. (Bubandt, 2005)
	•	security itself is so powerful an aspiration that to invoke it rhetorically tends to pre-empt critical scrutiny. (Zedner, 2009)
	•	Security is presented as politically neutral, as necessary, and so obviously desirable that it is not easy to gainsay. (Zedner, 2009)
	•	Security is commonly asserted as a basic right or fundamental good which has the effect of foreclosing debate about its priority or relationship with other goods. (Zedner, 2009)
	•	Security is invoked as the justification for intrusions upon civil liberties, as well as the ground for mass accumulation, storage, and exchange of information about individuals and organizations. (Zedner, 2009)
	•	although security embraces the pursuit of risk reduction it presumes the persistence of threat. (Zedner, 2009)
	•	security has an unattainable quality, its pursuit can never be said to be over since unknown vulnerabilities, new threats, and new adversaries always leave it open to challenge (Freedman 2003). The threats of crime and terrorism (or famine or environmental disaster), even if reducible, remain ineradicable. (Zedner, 2009)
	•	absolute security is unattainable and that, even if it were, is not sought by those whose political and economic prosperity relies upon continuing threat. (Zedner, 2009)
	•	although security promises to reassure by improving individual and collective perceptions of safety, ironically the paraphernalia of security tends to raise perceptions of risk, increase anxiety, and to disappoint when the feared risk materializes and the security measures are seen to have failed. (Zedner, 2009)
	•	although security is posited as a universal good, its pursuit is predicated upon threat and, therefore, those who threaten. Pursuing security necessarily places some sections of the populace outside protection and entails targeting and incapacitating those deemed to pose a threat (Loader 1997a, Zedner 2003b: 166). Social exclusion is thus an inescapable companion of security, a fact exacerbated by the common tendency to overstate claims for public protection. (Zedner, 2009)
	•	security relies on techniques for identifying, classifying, and managing aggregate suspect populations (Feeley and Simon 1994, Feeley 2004). (Zedner, 2009)
	•	although security promises freedom and the liberty of citizens to pursue their individual and collective goals free from injury, harm, or loss, paradoxically it has the strong tendency also to infringe individual liberties. (Zedner, 2009)
	•	although security is held up as a public good, the manner in which it is pursued too often tends to erode trust and other attributes of the good society. (Zedner, 2009)
	•	Security also licenses forms of defensive cocooning that are potentially burdensome and, ultimately, detrimental. (Zedner, 2009)
	•	security is commonly sold and pursued as an unassailable good. (Zedner, 2009)
	•	Historically, subjective feelings of security signified an absence of anxiety that was regarded as culpable in its negligence, an open invitation to harm. (Zedner, 2009)
	•	Security is constitutive of society in the sense of being a basic ingredient of social interaction and of political community. (Zedner, 2009)
	•	The human need for security should not be permitted to defeat itself. (Zedner, 2009)
	•	Security, as described in Chapter 2, is, essentially, freedom from negative risks. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Security is a primary responsibility of government, which acquires militaries, police forces, coast guards, border protections, helth authorities, and various regulators to ensure the seucirty of their territory and citizens. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Security is the abscence of risks. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	[…] security can be conceptualized as the inverse of risk and any of its sources or associated causes, including threats, hazards, exposure, or vulnerability. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Security as a term is often used in combination or interchangeably with safety, defense, protection, invulberability, or capacity, but each is a separate concept, even though each has implications for the other. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	[…] security is “the state of being or feeling secure,” and being secure means that we are “certain to remain safe and untrehated”. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	For criminologists, “[s]ecurity is the outcome of managing risk in the face of a variety of harms … [or] freedom from danger, fear or anxiety” (Van Brunschot & Kennedy, 2008, p. 10). (Newsome, 2013)
	•	For the Humanirtarian Practice Network (2010, p. xviii) security is “freedom from risk or harm resulting from violence or other interntional acts”. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Security crosses many domain. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	[…] security is studied, at least implicitly, by a mix of disciplines, fields, and subfields, some of them ambiguous or contested. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Security has traditionally been understood as National Security, concerning itself with territorial integrity and the protection fo the instiutsion and interest of the state from both internal and external threats. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	The achievement of security is an imperfect trade-off between capacity and security – between capacity reserved against emerging risks and capacity converted into controls on current risks. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Security should be seen as a mission-critical element of the organization. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	This, Michael Williams argues, was the genesis of the modern concept of security. ‘Security’ was a new way of thinking about conflict that offered an escape from what Theodore Rabb termed the ‘crisis of the seventeenth century’.12 Security opened the possibility of redefining ‘threat’ in terms of particular dangers to the peace of particular societies, rather than in terms of threats to the universal peace offered by religion. Wars fought through a universalist religious language, such as the Thirty Years War, were almost impossible to end. Security, Williams argues, offered a way to end the conflicts of universals by redefining the terms by which a threat was ‘spotted’. (Rasmussen, 2001)
	•	Security conceptually integrated a number of ‘interests’ into a coherent strategy for how a state should act. (Rasmussen, 2001)
	•	political use of ‘security’ has recently shifted from a focus on the interstate, military problem of maintaining territorial borders to the social and global problem of maintaining ‘life’ across borders (Duffield, 2004). (Bubandt, 2005)
	•	two views of security studies are now on the table,the new one of the wideners and the old military and state-centered view ofthe traditionalists. (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	Security is a particular type of politics applicable to a wide range of issues. (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	[…] it offers a constructivist operational method for distinguishing the processes of securitization from that of politicization – for understanding who can securitize what and under what conditions. (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	The need is to construct a conceptualization of security that means something much more specific than just any threat or problem. Threats and vulnerabilities can arise in many differet areas, military and non-military, but to count as security issues they have to meet strictly defined criteria that distinguish them from the normal run of the merely political? They have to be staged as existential threats to a referent object by a securitizing actor who thereby generates endorsement of emergency measures beyond rules that would otherwise bind. (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	Embracing the widersecurity agenda means we need to consider what sectors mean. (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	The answer to what makes something an international securityissue can be found in the traditional military-political understanding ofsecurity. In this context, security is about survival. It is when an issue is presented as posing an existential threat to a designated referent object (traditionally, but not necessarily, the state, incorporating government, territory, and society). (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	The special nature of security threats justifies the use ofextraordinary measures to handle them. (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	The invocation of security has beenthe key to legitimizing the use of force, but more generally it has openedthe way for the state to mobilize, or to take special powers, to handle existential threats. (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	Traditionally, by saying "security," a state representative declares an emergency condition, thus claiming a right to use what ever means are necessary to block a threatening development (Weaver 1988,1995b). (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	Existential threat can only be understood in relation tothe particular character of the referent object in question. (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	Traditional security studies tends to see all military affairs as instances of security, but this may not be the case. (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	"Security" is the move that takes politics beyond the established rules ofthe game and frames the issue either as a special kind of politics or asabove politics. (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	"Security" is thus a self-referential practice, because it is in this practicethat the issue becomes a security issue—not necessarily because a real exis-tential threat exists but because the issue is presented as such a threat. (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	Ifwe place the survival of collective units and principles—the politics ofexistential threat—as the defining core of security studies, we have thebasis for applying security analysis to a variety of sectors without losingthe essential quality of the concept. (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	security is ageneric term that has a distinct meaning but varies in form. (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	Security meanssurvival in the face of existential threats, but what constitutes an existentialthreat is not the same across different sectors. (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	Basically, security should be seen as negative, as a failure todeal with issues as normal politics. (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	security can be approached both objectively (there is a real threat) and subjectively (there is a perceived threat) and that nothing ensures that these two approaches will lineup. (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	security is determined by actors and in this respect is subjective. (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	security (as with all politics) ultimately rests neither with theobjects nor with the subjects but among the subjects (cf. Arendt 1958,1959; Waver 1990; Huysmans 1996). (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	the security quality is supplied by politics. (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	Security action is usually taken on behalf of, and with reference to, a collectivity. (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	Security, by definition, is and should be about the state, andthe state is and should be about security, with the emphasis on military andpolitical security. (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	When security is expanded beyond the state,we have problematic securitizations such as environmental security; whenthe state expands beyond security, we have problems such as the conflationof economic security with protectionism. (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	Security is an area of compering actors, but it is a biased one in which thestate is still generally privileged as the actor historically endowed withsecurity tasks and most adequately structured for the purpose. (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	In practice, security is not totally subjective.There are socially defined limits to what can and cannot be securitized,although those limits can be changed. (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	Security is a growing industry. It is expanding all the time. So too, more alarmingly, is the concept itself. (Coker, 2009)
	•	In the classical age security (derived from the Latin securitas) referred to tranquillity and freedom from care, or what Cicero termed the absence of anxiety upon which the fulfilled life depends. (Coker, 2009)
	•	For today risk has changed everything, especially the way we conceive security. (Coker, 2009)
	•	Security has become ‘three-dimensional’ where it impacts most − our imagination. (Coker, 2009)
	•	Risks are not always based on objective assessments that we find in physics; they are subjective and embed- ded in culture. They are not always open to testing or validation. They are not always calculative. And that is the challenge because societies, like people, are not easily argued out of their fears. (Coker, 2009)
	•	Unlike fear, anxiety is grounded not in the immediate or the perceived, but the imagined. (Coker, 2009)
	•	Security and the state are linked at the hip. (Coker, 2009)
	•	After 1850, the security which the state provided the citizen was extended to include not only safety against external enemies, but also security against internal anxieties: the perennial insecurity which stemmed from falling ill or finding oneself unemployed or surviving into a destitute old age. The social contract into which the citizen and state entered was more Bismarckian than Hobbesian, for it was Bismarck who entered into the first ‘grand bargain’ − the state provided social security at home in return for the citizen’s willingness to be conscripted. (Coker, 2009)
	•	Security is not a project: it is a process in which solutions evolve over time. (Coker, 2009)
	•	The strategic function for security that is critical for this study accommodates all the elements in national assets, not only those usually controlled by ministries or departments of defence. (Gray, 2014)
	•	Security lends itself as a convenient all-purpose abstract idea that provides useful cover to all kinds of concern. (Gray, 2014)
	•	Security truly is so subjective, while being abstract and vague, that it is a perfect conceptual conscript for allegedly good causes. (Gray, 2014)
	•	Security is a value with meaning not commonly understood to be subjective. (Gray, 2014)
	•	security is rarely considered as an objectively deter- minable quality; rather is it a judgement, even a feeling. A sense of security captures well the element of inherent uncertainty about it. (Gray, 2014)
	•	Today ‘security’ as a political value, at least in Western thinking, has no independent meaning and is related to individual or societal value systems. (Brauch, 2011)
	•	As a social science concept, “security is ambiguous and elas- tic in its meaning” (Art 1993: 820 – 22). (Brauch, 2011)
	•	Wolfers (1962) pointed to two sides of the security concept: “Security, in an objective sense, measures the absence of threats to acquired values, in a subjective sense, the absence of fear that such values will be attacked”. (Brauch, 2011)
	•	
	•	From the perspective of social constructivist ap- proaches in international relations (Adler 1997; Fearon/Wendt 2002; Risse 2003; Wendt 1992, 1999) ‘security’ is conceived as an outcome of a process of social and political interaction where social values and norms, collective identities and cultural traditions are essential. From this perspective, security is always in- tersubjective or “security is what actors make of it” (Wendt 1992). (Brauch, 2011)
	•	For Wolfers security refers to an absence of objec- tive dangers, i.e. of security ‘threats’, ‘challenges’, ‘vulnerabilities’ and ‘risks’, and of subjective fears or concerns, and to the perception thereof. (Brauch, 2011) 
	•	From a realist perspective, objective security is achieved when the dangers posed by manifold threats, challenges, vulnerabilities and risks are avoided, prevented, managed, coped with, mitigated and adapted to by individuals, societal groups, the state or regional or global international organizations. (Brauch, 2011)
	•	From a social constructivist ap- proach, security is achieved once the perception and fears of security ‘threats’, ‘challenges’, ‘vulnerabilities’ and ‘risks’ are allayed and overcome. (Brauch, 2011)
	•	Security is thus an ‘end’ that public policy has to secure, for which both resilience and intelligence are ‘means’. (Omand, 2014)
	•	Security holds an emblem of justice administered. (Omand, 2014)
	•	‘Security’ should mean for us today in describing a state of public confidence in the management of threats such as terrorism and natural hazards such as flooding or pandemic disease that threaten to generate insecurity and to disrupt normal life. (Omand, 2014)
	•	Security, as a sense of public confidence that it is safe to go outside, work and play and get on with one’s life, is at the heart of good government. (Omand, 2014)
Maxium security
	•	But maximum security is not a condition without costs. (Zedner, 2009)
	•	Maximizing security therefore necessarily has distributive implications (Rawls 1973: ch. 1). (Zedner, 2009)
	•	Mill’s model of maximizing liberty is an especially apposite one in the context of pursuing security (Mill 1979). (Zedner, 2009)
Human security
	•	In May 2004, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA, 2003) created a Human Security Unit. It defines human security as “a concept concerned with the security of individuals and promoting the protection of individuals’ physical safety, economic and social well-being, human dignity, and human rights and fundamental freedoms.” (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Human security grew as a valued concept particularly among those who work on international or global development and humanitarian affairs. It is now included in military doctrines for stabilization, counterinsurgency, and counterterrorism after excessive focus on homeland security and national securith in the 2000s. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	[…] increasingly, the understanding of security has been broadened to include the notion of Human Security, which emphasizes the protection of individuals who seek safety and security in their daily lives.
	•	Human security emcompasses freedom from fear of persecution, intimidation, reprisals, terrorism and other forms of systematic violence as well as freedom from want of immediate basic needs such as food, water, sanitation, and shelter. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	human security has human beings and humankind as the referent. (Brauch, 2011)
Military security
	•	the military security concerns the two-level interplayof the armed offensive and defensive capabilities of states, and states' per-ceptions of each other's intentions. (Buzan et al., 1997)
Political security
	•	Political security concerns the organi-zational stability of states, systems of government and the ideologies thatgive them legitimacy. (Buzan et al., 1997)
Economic security
	•	Economic security concerns access to the resources,finance and markets necessary to sustain acceptable levels of welfare andstate power. (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	Condorcet suggested that the economic secu- rity of individuals was an essential condition for political society. Fear − and the fear of fear − were for him the enemies of the political vision. (Coker, 2009)
Societal security
	•	Societal security concerns the sustainability, within accept-able conditions for evolution, of traditional patterns of language, cultureand religious and national identity and custom. (Buzan et al., 1997)
Environmental security
	•	Environmental security concerns the maintenance of the local and the planetary biosphere as theessential support system on which all other human enterprises depend. (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	The environment is becoming an interesing case, because groups are using a securitizing logic that exactly followsthe format prescribed in the previous section: The environment has to survive; therefore, this issue should take priority over all others, because if theenvironment is degraded to the point of no return all other issues will losetheir meaning. If the normal system (politics according to the rules as theyexist) is not able to handle this situation, we (Greenpeace and especially themore extremist ecoterrorists) will have to take extraordinary measures tosave the environment. Sustainability might be the environmentalists' equiv-alent of the state's sovereignty and the nation's identity; it is the essentialconstitutive principle that has to be protected. If this idea catches on, theenvironment itself may be on the way to becoming a referent object—anobject by reference to which security action can be taken in a socially sig-nificant way. (Buzan et al., 1997)
Security act
	•	The security act is negotiated betweensecuritizer and audience—that is, internally within the unit—but therebythe securitizing agent can obtain permission to override rules that wouldotherwise bind it. (Buzan et al., 1997)
National security
	•	National security should not be idealized. It works to silence opposition and has given power holders many opportunities to exploit "threats"for domestic purposes, to claim a right to handle something with less demo-cratic control and constraint. Our belief, therefore, is not "the more securitythe better." (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	The most important contextual factor for national security is an ignorance about the future that is not reliably reducible. It is necessary to emphasize the persistent fact of the lack of knowledge about tomorrow, because attempts to alleviate that condition can transform worthy aspiration for a tolerable tomorrow into a highly unreliable belief that the future is substantially so foreseeable, miraculously perhaps, that light has dawned already. (Gray, 2014)
	•	National security issues have been the subject of continuous public discussion, but in quite different contexts. (Brown, 1983)
	•	Indeed, a national government has no more fundamental responsabilty than to safeguard the nation’s security. (Brown, 1983)
	•	The real world imposes severe limitations on any aspirations toward an ideal condition of national security today. (Brown, 1983)
	•	Another measure of national security is economic strength and independence. (Brown, 1983)
	•	National security, then, is the ability to preserve the nation’s physical integrity and territory; to maintain its economic relations with the rest of the world on reasonable terms; to protect its nature, insitutions, and governance from disruption from ouside; and to control its borders. (Brown, 1983)
	•	A national security policy for the 1980s and 1990s must come to grisps with the Soviet Union and the relations the United States has with the OSviet Union. It must take into account the realities of the U.S. economy and confront world economic issues that make the United States dependent on other nations – especially the issue of energy supply. It must provide adequate strategic nuclear forces and sound  nuclear doctrine; an overall political and military strategy for Europe, East Asia, and Southwest Asia; and conventional and nuclear forces of sufficient size, capability, and flexivility to carru out those strategies. (Brown, 1983)
	•	National security and the national welfare are inseparable. (Brown, 1983)
	•	national security today should be defined as a state of trust on the part of the citizen that the risks to everyday life, whether from man-made threats or impersonal hazards, are being adequately managed to the extent that there is confidence that normal life can continue. (Omand, 2014)
	•	inclusive approach to national security where the aim is to man- age the risks of natural hazards as well as man-made threats. (Omand, 2014)
	•	Providing for public security is an exercise in risk management not risk elimination. (Omand, 2014)
National security strategy
	•	National security strategy, however, is not a fight against nature. It is a struggle against conscious counterstrategies. (Betts, 2007)
	•	National security strategy is not like a chess game. (Betts, 2007)
	•	Security strategy is no different from any other form of strategy; it consists of linking ends, ways and means. (Omand, 2014)
	•	national security strategies today rely more than ever on anticipation as a key feature in assuring public safety. (Omand, 2014)
Security argument
	•	A security argument always involves two predic-tions: What will happen if we do not take "security action" (the threat), andwhat will happen if we do (How is the submitted security policy supposedto work?). (Buzan et al., 1997)
Securityness
	•	securityness is not only a matter of degree—"how threatening"—but is also a qualitative question: Do we choose to attach the security label with its ensuing effects?  (Buzan et al., 1997)
Homeland security
	•	Homeland security is supposed to increase the safety of the citizen. (Coker, 2009)
Hational security
	•	national security has the state as the major referent. (Brauch, 2011)
Distress security
	•	The term ‘distress security’ broadly refers to securities issued by companies which have defaulted and filed for credit protection. (Coker, 2009)
Security dilemma
	•	‘security dilemma’: each perceives a threat from the defensive preparations of others, and reactive arms modernization and acquisition can spiral into regional arms races. (Frühling, 2014)
	•	Uncertainty and secrecy sometimes work for deterrence purposes. Too much, however, may increase suspicion and exacerbate hostility between states and result in spiraling escalation of competitive and conflictual relationship, thus fostering a “security dilemma.”. (Choi, 1996)
	•	The international relations literature highlights the importance of the security dilemma— where one country’s e orts to make itself more secure can decrease the security of others. (Kiselycznyk et al., 2010)

Security performance
	•	Conceptual keys to sound enough security performance may be found in understanding the utility of strategy and the salience of context. (Gray, 2014)

Security perception
	•	Subjective factors influence security perceptions. (Brauch, 2011)
	•	The perception of security dangers depends on the worldviews or traditions of the analyst (Bull 1977, Wight 1991) and on the mind-set of policymakers (Booth 1979, 1987: 39 – 66) that have often distorted the assessment of ‘new challenges’ and that “freeze international relations into crude images, portray its processes as mechanistic responses of power and characterize other nations as stereotypes” (Booth 1987: 44; 1998: 28). (Brauch, 2011)
Security assessment
	•	in assessing security, we could measure security as the inverse of the risks (Chapter 3), the hazards and threats (Chapter 4), or our exposure and vulnerability (Chapter 5). The choice between these options will depend on our availbale time and interet in a deeper assessment and the availbality and our confidence in the data. (Newsome, 2013)
Constructivist security
	•	Constructivist security studies argue that the means of spotting threats and resisting and using force are socially constructed. ‘Security’ itself functions as a ‘signifier’ by means of which certain rules are applied to actions of force. These rules constitute a particular rationality that prescribes the appropriate way of acting in certain circumstances. Security theories translate these prescriptions into praxeologies either in a prescriptive or descriptive form. The profound consequence of this view is that there can be no universal theory of security. (Rasmussen, 2001)
	•	While constructivist security studies have been quite successful in demonstrating that security, to paraphrase Alexander Wendt, is ‘what states make of it’. (Rasmussen, 2001)
security organizations
	•	The proliferation of such security organizations may set a pattern for the future: it may establish a highly complex network of networks, each consisting of interconnected and partially interlocking organizations very different from the rival systems of alliances and blocs that were so characteristic of the twentieth century. (Coker, 2009)

Security community
	•	All security communities are obliged to satisfy the function of defence planning. (Gray, 2014)

Security complex theory 
	•	Traditional  security complex theory has considerable power to explain and predit both the formation of durable regional patterns of security relations and the pattern of outside intervention in theses regions. (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	Classical security complex theory posits the existence of regional sub-systems as objects of security analysis and offers an analytical frameworkfor dealing with those systems. Also, like most other traditionalist work inthis area, the theory has focused primarily on the state as the key unit andon the political and military sectors. (Buzan et al., 1997) 
	•	This framework was designed to highlight the relative autonomy of regional security relations and to set thoserelations within the context of the unit (state) and system levels. (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	All of the states in the system are enmeshed in a global web of securityinterdependence. But because most political and military threats travelmore easily over short distances than over long ones, insecurity is oftenassociated with proximity. (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	Most states fear their neighbors more than dis-tant powers; consequently, security interdependence across the internation-al system as a whole is far from uniform. 
	•	The normal pattern of securityinterdependence in a geographically diverse, anarchic international systemis one of regionally based clusters, which we label security complexes. (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	Security interdependence is markedly more intense among the states insidesuch complexes than among states outside them. (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	Security complexes areabout the relative-intensity of interstate security relations that lead to distinctive regional patterns shaped by both the distribution of power and his-torical relations of amity and enmity. (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	A security complex is defined as a setof states whose major security perceptions and concerns are so interlinkedthat their national security problems cannot reasonably be analyzed orresolved apart from one another The formative dynamics and structure of asecurity complex are generated by the states within that complex—by theirsecurity perceptions of, and interactions with, each other. Individual security complexes are durable but not permanent features of the internationalsystem. 
	•	The theory posits that in a geographically diverse, anarchic international system, security complexes are a normal and expected feature; if they are not present, one wants to know why. (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	The internal dynamics of a security complex can be locat-ed along a spectrum according to whether the defining security interdepen-dence is driven by amity or enmity. (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	Regional integration among somemembers of a complex will transform the power structure of that complex. (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	The theory assumes that security complexes, like the balance of power, are an intrinsic product of anarchic international systems. (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	Security complexes are subsystems—miniature anarchies—in theirown right, and by analogy with full systems they have structures of theirown. (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	Essential structure is the standard by which one assesses significantchange in a classical security complex. The three key components of essen-tial structure in a security complex are (1) the arrangement of the units andthe differentiation among them (this is normally the same as for the interna-tional system as a whole, and if so it is not a significant variable at theregional level), (2) the patterns of amity and enmity, and (3) the distributionof power among the principal units. Major shifts in any of these components would normally require a redefinition of the complex. (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	In one sense, security complexes are theoretical constructs the analyst imposes on "reality. (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	One value of classical security complex theory is that it draws attention away from the extremes of national and global security and focuses it on the region, where these two extremes interplay and where most of theaction occurs. (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	Security complex theory also links studies of internal condi-tions in states, relations among states of the region, relations amongregions, and relations between regions and globally acting great powers. (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	security complex theory can be used to generate definitive scenarios andthus to structure the study of, as well as predictions about, possibilities forstability and change. (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	The theory offers descriptive concepts for both staticand dynamic analysis and provides benchmarks for locating significant change within the structure of international security relations. (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	The theory is prescriptive to the extent that itidentifies appropriate (and inappropriate) realms for action and organization and suggests a range of states of being (conflict formation, security regime, security community) that can serve as frameworks for thinkingabout policy objectives. (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	Security complexes are formed from the inside out, by the interactions amongtheir constituent units. (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	a concept such as security complex isdefined not by whether actors label themselves a complex (they do not!)but by analysts' interpretation of who is actually interconnected in terms ofsecurity interaction. (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	Security complex is basically an analytical term;security is a political practice that we have distilled into a specific, moreprecise category on the basis of the way the concept is used. (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	the security complex is actually a constellation of security concern. (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	In classical security complex theory (CSCT), the definition wasphrased in terms of primary security concerns; in the current framework, itmust be instances of securitization that connect and form the complex. Inboth cases, the core is obviously the articulation of threats by the majoractors. (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	When generating the security complex, the best way to define thepoints between which the security arrows go might be to point to conglomerates of a referent object and the corresponding securitizing actor. (Buzan et al., 1997)
Regional security complex theory 
	•	RSCT is useful for three reasons. First it tells us something about the appropriate level of analysis in security studies, second it can organise empirical studies, and, third, theory-based scenarios can be established on the basis of the known possible forms of, and alternatives to, RSCs. (Buzan and Wæver, 2003)
	•	RSCs are defined by durable patterns of amity and enmity taking the form of subglobal, geographically coherent patterns of security inter- dependence. (Buzan and Wæver, 2003)
	•	The formation of RSCs derives from the interplay between, on the one hand, the anarchic structure and its balance-of-power consequences, and on the other the pressures of local geographical proximity. (Buzan and Wæver, 2003)
	•	The standard form for an RSC is a pattern of rivalry, balance-of-power, and alliance patterns among the main powers within the region: to this pattern can then be added the effects of penetrating external powers. (Buzan and Wæver, 2003)
	•	‘Regional security complex’ is not just a perspective that can be applied to any group of countries. (Buzan and Wæver, 2003)
	•	RSC, a group of states or other entities must possess a degree of security interdependence sufficient both to establish them as a linked set and to differentiate them from surrounding security regions. (Buzan and Wæver, 2003)
	•	Within the terms of RSCT, RSCs define themselves as substructures of the international system by the relative intensity of security interdependence among a group of units, and security indifference between that set and surrounding units. (Buzan and Wæver, 2003)
	•	RSC is not in terms of the discursive ‘construction of regions’. (Buzan and Wæver, 2003)
	•	Regional security complex is an analytical concept defined and applied by us, but these regions (RSCs) are socially constructed in the sense that they are contingent on the security practice of the actors. (Buzan and Wæver, 2003)
	•	‘Regional security complex’ is our analytical term and therefore something is an RSC when it qualifies according to our criteria, not according to the criteria of practitioners. (Buzan and Wæver, 2003)
	•	RSCs are thus a very specific, functionally defined type of region, which may or may not coincide with more general understandings of region. (Buzan and Wæver, 2003)
	•	RSCs can have overlapping memberships (which we examine in more detail in the final section of this chapter, pp. 78–82), our position is that they are mutually exclusive. (Buzan and Wæver, 2003)
	•	We take as the starting point of the analysis that the whole world has to be divided up on a map producing mutually exclusive RSCs, insulator states, and global actors (Buzan and Wæver, 2003)
	•	RSCs are distinguished from each other by degrees of relative security connectedness and indifference. They are distinguished from global powers by occupying a different level of analysis (Buzan and Wæver, 2003)
	•	starting assumption that the world can be divided into a definite number of exclusive RSCs (Buzan and Wæver, 2003)
	•	structure and character of RSCs are defined by two kinds of relations, power relations and patterns of amity and enmity. (Buzan and Wæver, 2003)
	•	RSCs, like the international sys- tem of which they are substructures, can be analysed in terms of polarity, ranging from unipolar, through bi- and tripolar, to multipolar. (Buzan and Wæver, 2003)
	•	RSCs are durable rather than permanent patterns. As substructures, they can have mediating effects on relations between the great powers and the local states as well as on the interactions of states in the regions. The RSC constitutes a social reality, which is more than the sum of its parts, and thus it is able to intervene between intentions and outcomes. Although the RSC does not exist independently of the states and their vulnerabilities, the outcome of their interactions would be different if it were not for the existence of the RSC. It is not a root cause in itself but a structure that modifies and mediates the action and interaction of units. (Buzan and Wæver, 2003)
	•	RSCT is as a framework organising empirical studies of regional security. (Buzan and Wæver, 2003)
	•	The four levels are: (1) domestically in the states of the region, particularly their domestically generated vulnerabilities (is the state strong or weak due to stability of the domestic order and correspondence between state and nation (Buzan 1991b)? The specific vulnerability of a state defines the kind of security fears it has (Wæver 1989) – and sometimes makes another state or group of states a structural threat even if it or they have no hostile intentions); (2) state-to-state relations (which generate the region as such); (3) the region’s interaction with neighbouring regions (this is sup- posed to be relatively limited given that the complex is defined by interaction internally being more important. But if major changes in the patterns of security interdependence that de- fine complexes are underway, this level can become significant, and in situations of gross asymmetries a complex with- out global powers that neighbours one with a global power can 
have strong interregional links in one direction); and finally (4) the role of global powers in the region (the interplay between 
the global and regional security structures). Taken together, these four levels constitute the security constellation (Buzan et al. 1998: 201ff.). (Buzan and Wæver, 2003)
	•	RSCT asserts that the regional level will always be operative, and sometimes dominant. It does not say that the regional level must always be dominant. (Buzan and Wæver, 2003)
	•	In its descriptive application RSCT is aimed at people working empirically on specific regions. It is mostly a descriptive language, a method for producing order out of complicated data, and for writing structural history. (Buzan and Wæver, 2003)
	•	The theory offers the possibility of systematically linking the study of internal conditions, relations among units in the region, relations between regions, and the interplay of regional dynamics with globally acting powers. (Buzan and Wæver, 2003)
	•	It also provides some structural logic, most notably the hypothesis that regional patterns of conflict shape the lines of intervention by global level powers. (Buzan and Wæver, 2003)
	•	One purpose of descriptive RSCT is to establish a benchmark against which to identify and assess changes at the regional level. Because RSCs are durable substructures with an important geographical component, they have both internal structures and external boundaries that can be used to monitor continuity and change and to distinguish significant change from less important events. (Buzan and Wæver, 2003)
	•	The essential structure of an RSC embodies four variables: (1) boundary, which differentiates the RSC from its neighbours; (2) anarchic structure, which means that the RSC must be composed of two or more autonomous units; (3) polarity, which covers the distribution of power among the 
units; and (4) social construction, which covers the patterns of amity and enmity among the units. (Buzan and Wæver, 2003)

	•	From its configuration at any given snapshot in time there are thus three possible evolutions open to an RSC: (1) maintenance of the status quo, which means that there are no significant changes in its essential structure; (2)internal transformation, which means that changes in essential structure occur within the context of its existing outer boundary. This could mean changes to the anarchic structure (because of regional integration); to polarity (because of disintegration, merger, conquest, differential growth rates, or suchlike); or to the dominant patterns of amity/enmity (because of ideological shifts, war-weariness, changes of leadership, etc.); and (3) external transformation, which means that the outer boundary expands or contracts, changing the membership of the RSC, and most probably transforming its essential structure in other ways. The most obvious way for this to happen is if two RSCs merge, as might happen if Israel became dramatically concerned about Pakistan’s ‘Islamic’ nuclear weapons; or less often two RSCs splitting out from one. (Buzan and Wæver, 2003)

	•	To trace RSCs empirically, one needs to look at the pattern of security connectedness in three steps: (1) is the issue securitised successfully by any actors?; (2) if yes, track the links and interactions from this instance – how does the security action in this case impinge on the security of who/what else, and where does this then echo significantly?, 
etc.; (3) these chains can then be collected as a cluster of interconnected 
security concerns. (Buzan and Wæver, 2003)

	•	The logic of security regions stems from the fact that internationalsecurity is a relational matter. (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	Security regions therefore had the following characteristics: 1. They were composed of two or more states. 2. These states constituted a geographically coherent grouping (because threats in these sectors travel more easily over short distances than over long ones). 3. The relationship among these states was marked by security inter-dependence, which could be either positive or negative but whichhad to be significantly stronger among them than between them andoutside states. 4. The pattern of security interdependence had to be deep and durable (i.e., much more than a one-time interaction), although not permanent. (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	we organize the region-al analysis around nodes that are simultaneously that which is (claimed tobe) threatened and that which is (depicted as) the source of threat. (Buzan et al., 1997)
Subcomplexes
	•	Subcomplexes have essentially the same definition as RSCs, the difference being that a subcomplex is firmly embedded within a larger RSC. (Buzan and Wæver, 2003)
	•	Subcomplexes represent distinctive patterns of security interdependence that are nonetheless caught up in a wider pattern that defines the RSC as a whole. (Buzan and Wæver, 2003)
	•	Subcomplexes are not a necessary feature of RSCs, but they are not uncommon either, especially where the number of states in an RSC is relatively large. (Buzan and Wæver, 2003)
	•	The device of subcomplexes eliminates most of what might otherwise occur as disturbing cases of overlapping membership between RSCs. (Buzan and Wæver, 2003)
Homogeneous complexes
	•	Homogeneous complexes. This approach retains the "classical" assumption that security complexes are concentrated within specific sectorsand are therefore composed of specific forms of interaction among similartypes of units (e.g., power rivalries among states). (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	This logic leads to different types of complexes that occur in different sectors (e.g., military complexes made up predominantly of states, a societal complex of various identity-based units, and the like). (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	Homogeneous, or sector-specific, security complexes (which wouldinclude the classical political-military, state-dominated model) require theconstruction of separate frames for each sector. (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	They offer the possibility ofisolating sector-specific security dynamics (politico-military, economic,societal, and so forth), but they also present the challenge of how toreassemble the separate frames into a holistic picture and the danger thatlinkages across sectors will be lost or obscured. (Buzan et al., 1997)
Heterogeneous complexes
	•	This approach abandons the assumptionthat security complexes are locked into specific sectors. It assumes that theregional logic can integrate different types of actors interacting across twoor more sectors (e.g., states + nations + firms + confederations interactingacross the political, economic, and societal sectors). (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	Heterogeneous security complexes have the advantage of linkingactors across sectors, thus enabling the analyst to keep the entire picture in a single frame and also to keep track of the inevitable spillovers betweensectors (military impacts on economic developments and the like). (Buzan et al., 1997)
Security coordination
	•	Security coordination implies deliberate cooperation, more than commercial relationships, political alliances, or rhetorical friendships. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Coordinating security between organizaitons is not easy, even when objectively each organization has a self-interest in coordination. (Newsome, 2013)
Security environment
	•	The current CCJO describes the security environment as an era of persistent conflict characterized by great uncertainty, growing volatility, and an increasingly complex range of threats spanning the spectrum of conflict. (Mauk, 2010)
	•	although many aspects of the future security environment are reasonably predictable, uncertainties are large and pervasive. (Davis, 2000)
Environment-shaping strategy
	•	environment-shaping strategy. This com- ponent of strategy is extremely important because, ultimately, the principal role of military forces in peacetime is to work together with other aspects of security strategy to greatly reduce the likelihood of future wars. (Davis, 2000)
	•	Environment shaping, then, is not about hegemonic coercion, but rather about engaging other nations in mu- tually respectful and productive ways. (Davis, 2000)
	•	the value of detailed planning: in fact, the likelihood of detailed plans proving valid over the long run is low. Nor can we rely upon environment-shaping efforts to be successful: too much about the international security system is chaotic. (Davis, 2000)
Security issues 
	•	Identifying security issues is easy for traditionalists, who, broadly speking, equate security with military issues and the use of force. But it is more difficult when security is moved out of the military sector. (Buzan et al., 1997)
Security levels
	•	Security has many levels: a useful scale would run through the personal, local, provincial, national (sovereign government), trans-national (across sovereign states without involving sovereign governments), international (between sovereign governments), and supra-national (higher authority than sovereign governments). (Newsome, 2013)
Security market
	•	Risk is essential to the health of the security market; without it shares would surely tumble. (Zedner, 2009)
Security measures
	•	Many security measures and practices are based upon a presumptive mistrust of strangers and many security technologies (for example, surveillance, data retention, access control, and target hardening) operate further to erode trust by presuming everyone to be a potential source of threat. (Zedner, 2009)
	•	security measures might better be understood as justified only insofar as they conduce to their attainment (Zedner 2005). (Zedner, 2009)
	•	The ends or goals of security meas- ures need to be specified in such a way as to ensure that the means by which they are sought are consistent with the ends sought. (Zedner, 2009)
	•	The proportionality of a security measure needs to be tied to the gravity of the prospective harm and then discounted by the likelihood, or not, of it actually occurring (Slobogin 2003). (Zedner, 2009)
	•	If security measures are not to damage the flourishing of that community, they need to satisfy public perceptions of legitimacy and of justice. (Zedner, 2009)
	•	security measures that provide maximum protection often come at a high price. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	Regardless of whether maximum or reasonable protection is required, the cost of each security measure must be determined. (Vellani, 2007)

Exceptional security measures
	•	Yet the exceptional security measures once thought necessary only in zones of highest risk (like airports and borders) have spilled over into ordin- ary life and ordinary places. (Zedner, 2009)
	•	Liberty-eroding measures introduced in respect of the gravest security threats have a common tendency to be come ‘normalized’ and extended to lesser threats with lesser justification (Hillyard 1994, Dyzenhaus 2001). (Zedner, 2009)
Security equipment costs
	•	Security equipment costs include initial costs, training costs, and ongoing maintenance and repair costs. (Vellani, 2007)
Security personnel costs
	•	Security personnel costs include background checks, training and continuing education, uniforms, equipment, and licensing. (Vellani, 2007)
Security mission
	•	In its most basic form, the mission of any security program is the protection of assets. Depending on the nature of the organization or facility in need of protection, the mission may be more complex or unique. (Vellani, 2007)
Security plan
	•	the Humanitarian Practice Network (2010, p. 14) prescribed continual communication of security plans: A plan is a piece of paper. Paper does not reduce any risks. Plans need to be shared, explained, and implemented; A good plan today may no longer be appropriate 6 months from now. If the situation evolves, review the analysis and plans; People not familiar with security plans and procedures cannot adhere to them. All staff and visitors need to be briefed as soon as they arrive and after any important changes are made; Good implementation depends on competencies. The best possible plan falls apart without the knowledge and skills to implement it. Some aspects of security management require specialized knowledge or skills; Effective security management depends to a degree on practice. Practicing—through simulations and training—is vital. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	The British Civil Contingencies Act (2004) obliged the principal emergency responders to “arrange for the publication of all or part assessments made and plans maintained … so far as is necessary or desirable for the purpose of: 1. preventing the emergency, 2. reducing, controlling or mitigating the effects of an emergency, or 3. enabling other action to be taken in connection with an emergency.” (Newsome, 2013)
	•	the security plan is a comprehensive document that sets forth the strategic vision of the security organization. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	The security plan is a written document that defines the organization’s security mission, provides an overview of the complete security program, and identifies all methods in use for the protection of organizational assets. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	The security plan documents the organization’s security policies, procedures, functions, measures, and strategies for providing a safe and secure environment and preventing crime and other security incidents. It is a living document in that it adapts as the organization’s security needs change and serves as a training aid for security awareness across the organization. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	The security plan articulates how the security program is usually organized through personnel and function organizational charts, flowcharts, and descriptions of specific countermeasures. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	Security plans also describe the common security measures utilized throughout the facility or facilities, as the case may be, and how these measures operate on a daily, routine basis. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	Security responsibilities are clearly delineated, and regulatory compliance measures are described in detail. As described in the preceding section, the security awareness component should also be articulated in the security plan. Threat-dependent measures and activities are enumerated in the security plan. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	The security plan also sets forth guidelines for quality control, benchmarking against industry best practices, and metric development and analysis. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	As a written document, the organization’s security plan defines the security mission. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	The security plan, as an overview of the complete security program, identifies the many and various ways in which security is provided. These methods include policies and procedures, physical security measures, and security personnel. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	The organization’s security plan is the document that summarizes known and postulated threats to the organization, which have been identified through the formal process of threat assessment. For each identified threat, the security measures in place are enumerated, with cross reference to other policy and procedure documents that address those measures specifically. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	The security plan would identify that threat potential and spell out the specific policies and procedures created and the measures in place to reduce the risk of infant abduction. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	In many organizations, all levels of employees from line personnel to senior management are responsible to varying degrees for the security of the facility. The security plan should address those responsibilities, and those groups of employees should be provided with security awareness training on key sections of the plan to ensure they understand their role in security. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	Threats change over time. The security plan must be able to guide the organ- ization as threat levels rise and fall and as new threats emerge. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	The security plan should clearly describe security changes implemented when threat conditions are elevated. The threat assessment is the driving force behind this section of the security plan. Not unlike the national threat condition responses, organizations, too, should prepare measures in advance of rising threat levels. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	The security plan also describes how the organization will measure its sec rity against other similar organizations and against industry best practices. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	The security plan should also describe the data collection and analysis process in order to create a relevant set of security metrics by which to measure the performance of various components of the security program. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	While the security plan is intended to be a holistic document, its various components must be comprehensive enough to guide the security program. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	security plans are proactive. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	Although the security manual and emergency management plans serve as the primary policies and procedures of an effective security program, other policies should be developed as needed to address security personnel and phys- ical security measures. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	

Security policy
	•	In the security field, three general types of countermeasures are taken to prevent, mitigate, and eliminate risk: policies and procedures, physical security measures, and security personnel. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	Despite their relative low cost to develop and maintain, and their ability to demonstrate due diligence, policies and procedures are often the most overlooked component of an effective security program. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	Documentation of the security program is a critical element and includes the identification of critical assets, threats, and vulnerabilities. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	the mantra of security decision makers should be documentation, documentation, documentation. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	A security program is never finished, never complete, never ending. Documentation of the security program’s current status as well as its strategic direction into the future may also demonstrate due diligence to a jury in an inadequate security lawsuit. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	Security policies and procedures refer to a wide variety of documents. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	The key requirement for security policies and procedures is that they be articulated in writing. Formal, written policies and procedures save security decision makers time, assist in adequate training, and reduce liability by demonstrating due diligence. The general intent of security policies and procedures is to document appropriate behaviors, actions, and responses for and to security events, but each type of policy has a specific purpose. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	Security policies and procedures serve as the backbone of any effective security program, and so their importance should not be underestimated. Not only do security policies and procedures guide the day-to-day operation of the security program, but they also move the security organization in the proper direction over the long term. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	On a practical level, security policies describe the security functions at a facility or for an organization, including how security functions and measures are organized, deployed, and managed. (Vellani, 2007)
Security professional
	•	The term security professional is also used when the issue under discussion is complex or a newer security concept. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	security professionals are in the business of national security or in the commercial and industrial sectors. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	Depending on the threat, security professionals can assess the likelihood and types of potential attacks if specific information on potential targets is available. (Vellani, 2007)
Security survey
	•	To paraphrase noted author Charles A. Sennewald, a security survey is a fact-finding process whereby the assessment team gathers data that reflects the who, what, how, where, when, and why of an organization’s existing operation and facility. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	The purpose of a security survey is to measure the vulnerabilities at a facility or of specific assets by determining what opportunities exist to exploit current security policies and procedures, physical security equipment, and security personnel. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	The outcome of a security survey is a report, normally written, that outlines a series of solutions that, if implemented, will reduce the short-term and long-term opportunities at a facility. Security surveys are designed to meet the unique needs of a facility or type of facility. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	Security surveys are simply questions and checklists that the assessment team must complete during off-site preparations and on-site inspections of the facility. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	Surveys may range from a few basic questions to highly detailed lists comprising thousands of questions. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	A typical security survey contains general information about a site and evaluates the geographic characteristics of the facility, physical layout of the facility and its unique characteristics, security and other personnel, operational requirements, security equipment capability and deployment schedules, and threats and other incidents that impact security. (Vellani, 2007)
Security studies
	•	Security studies is itself an outcropping of another part of the social science diaspora, international relations, which in turn grew out of political theory and science. (Grey, 2009)
	•	Security studies in turn emerged as a subject following the Second World War and was in large part a response both to the failure of the inter- national system to prevent that conflict and to the new international situ- ation emerging from the dislocation and chaos it had engendered. Thus the formation of the subject is directly linked to war, and this has shaped, and continues to shape, its core concerns. (Grey, 2009)
	•	[…] two views of security studies are now on the table, the new one of the wideners and the old military and state-centered view of he traditionalists. (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	Risk has replaced threat as the centre of security studies. (Coker, 2009)
Security theories
	•	Theories of security are essentially praxeologies: theories guiding action. (Rasmussen, 2001)
Securitization
	•	securitization is a discursive device for community-building, for the rhetorical evocation and political realization of imagined communities at various scales (see Anderson, 1992) (Bubandt, 2005)
	•	Securitization is concerned with the processes through which particular issues become constituted as ‘security’ issues, and are seen as amenable to security solutions (or, in parallel, the way that other issues are ‘de-securitized’ and so seen as outside the scope of security studies). (Grey, 2009)
	•	Securitization can thus be seen as a more extreme version ofpoliticization. In theory, any public issue can be located on the spectrumranging from nonpoliticized (meaning the state does not deal with it and itis not in any other way made an issue of public debate and decision)through politicized (meaning the issue is part of public policy, requiringgovernment decision and resource allocations or, more rarely, some otherform of communal governance) to securitized (meaning the issue is presented as an existential threat, requiring emergency measures and justifyingactions outside the normal bounds of political procedure). (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	In principle, theplacement of issues on this spectrum is open: Depending upon circum-stances, any issue can end up on any part of the spectrum. In practice,placement varies substantially from state to state (and also across time). Some states will politicize religion (Iran, Saudi Arabia, Burma) and somewill not (France, the United States). Some will securitize culture (the former USSR, Iran) and some will not (the UK, the Netherlands). (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	In the case of issues (notably the environment) that have moved dramatically out of thenonpoliticized category, we face the double question of whether they havemerely been politicized or have also been securitized. This link between politicization and securitization does not imply that securitization always goes through the state; politicization as well as securitization can be enact-ed in other fora as well. (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	In the case of security, textual analysis (Waver 1988, 1995b, 1995c) suggests that something is designated as an international security issue because it can be argued that this issue is more important than other issues and should take absolute priority. This is the reason we link the issue to what might seem a fairly demanding criterion: that the issue is presented as an existential threat. (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	when a securitizing actor uses a rhetoric of existential threat and thereby takes an issueout of what under those conditions is "normal politics," we have a case of securitization. (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	the exact definition and criteria of securitization isconstituted by the intersubjective establishment of an existential threat witha saliency sufficient to have substantial political effects. (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	Securitization canbe studied directly; it does not need indicators. (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	The way to study securitiza-tion is to study discourse and political constellations: When does an argu-ment with this particular rhetorical and semiotic structure achieve sufficienteffect to make an audience tolerate violations of rules that would otherwisehave to be obeyed? If by means of an argument about the priority andurgency of an existential threat the securitizing actor has managed to break free of procedures or rules he or she would otherwise be bound by, we arewitnessing a case of securitization. (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	Since securitization cannever only be imposed, there is some need to argue one's case. (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	Securitization is not fulfilled only by breaking rules (which can takemany forms) nor solely by existential threats (which can lead to nothing) but by cases of existential threats that legitimize the breaking of rules. (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	In a securitized situation, a unit does not rely on the social resources of rules sharedintersubjectively among units but relies instead on its own resources,demanding the right to govern its actions by its own priorities (Weaver I996b). (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	A successful securitization thus has three components (or steps): existential threats, emergency action, and effects on interunit relations by breaking free of rules. (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	The distinguishing feature of securitization is a specific rhetoricalstructure (survival, priority of action "because if the problem is not handlednow it will be too late, and we will not exist to remedy our failure"). (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	That quality is the staging of existential issues in politics to lift themabove politics. In security discourse, an issue is dramatized and presented as an issue of supreme priority; thus, by labeling it as security, an agent claims a need for and a right to treat it by extraordinary means. (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	The process of securitization is what in language theory is called a speechact. It is not interesting as a sign referring to something more real; it is the utterance itself that is the act. By saying the words, something is done (likebetting, giving a promise, naming a ship) (Waver 1988; Austin 1975:98ff.). (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	the security speech act is not defined by uttering the word security. What is essential is the designation of an existentialthreat requiring emergency action or special measures and the acceptanceof that designation by a significant audience. (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	in some cases securitization has become institutionalized. (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	Securitization can be either ad hoc or institutionalized. (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	Some security practices are not legitimized in public by security dis-course, because they are not out in the public at all (e.g., the "black pro-grams" in the United States, which are not presented in the budget), but thisis actually a very clear case of the security logic. (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	Although in one sense securitization is a further intensification ofpoliticization (thus usually making an even stronger role for the state), inanother sense it is opposed to politicization. (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	securitization on the international level(although often not on the domestic one) means to present an issue asurgent and existential, as so important that it should not be exposed to thenormal haggling of politics but should be dealt with decisively by top leaders prior to other issues. (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	it is always a political choice to securitize or to accept a securitization. (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	securitization, like politicization, has to be under-stood as an essentially intersubjective process. (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	When states or nations securitize an issue—"correctly" or not—it is a polit-ical fact that has consequences, because this securitization will cause theactor to operate in a different mode than he or she would have otherwise. (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	it does matter how others judge the reason-ableness of a securitization, because this influences how other actors in thesystem will respond to a security claim. What may seem a legitimate secu-ritization within a given political community may appear paranoid to thoseoutside it (e.g., Western perceptions of Soviet concerns about pop musicand jeans). Conversely, outsiders may perceive that a political communityundersecuritizes a "real" threat and thus endangers itself or free rides (e.g.,U.S. perceptions of Danish defense policy during the Cold War). The waythe securitization processes of one actor fit with the perceptions of othersabout what constitutes a "real" threat matters in shaping the interplay of  securities within the international system. Both within and between actors,the extent of shared intersubjective understandings of security is one key tounderstanding behavior. (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	Securitization is intersubjective and socially constructed. (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	Successful securitization is notdecided by the securitizer but by the audience of the security speech act. (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	Inconcrete analysis, however, it is important to be specific about who is moreor less privileged in articulating security. To study securitization is to studythe power politics of a concept. (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	The use of a specific con-ceptualization is always a choice—it is politics, it is not possible to decideby investigating the threat scientifically. (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	actors and their audiences securitize certain issues as aspecific form of political act. Actors who securitize do not necessarily say"security," nor does their use of the term security necessarily always consti-tute a security act. (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	As afirst step, the designation of what constitutes a security issue comes from political actors, not analysts, but analysts interpret political actors' actionsand sort out when these actions fulfill the security criteria. It is, further, theanalyst who judges whether the actor is effective in mobilizing supportaround this security reference (i.e., the attempted securitizers are "judged"first by other social actors and citizens, and the degree of their following isthen interpreted and measured by us). (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	Finally, to assess the significance ofan instance of securitization, analysts study its effects on other units. The actor commands at only one very crucial step: the performance of a political act in a security mode. (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	The securitization approach serves to underline the responsibility of talking security, the responsibility of actors as well as of analysts who choose to frame an issue as a security issue. (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	securitization of the individual is a real political practice of our times. (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	security analysis is inter-ested mainly in successful instances of securitization—the cases in whichother people follow the securitizing lead, creating a social, intersubjectiveconstitution of a referent object on a mass scale. Unsuccessful or partiallysuccessful attempts at securitization are interesting primarily for theinsights they offer into the stability of social attitudes toward security legit-imacy, the process by which those attitudes are maintained or changed, andthe possible future direction of security politics. (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	In these larger patterns,desecuritization is at least as interesting as securitization, but the successfulacts of securitization take a central place because they constitute the currently valid specific meaning of security. (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	the securitization perspective, which basi-cally removes the objective ground from the dominant discourse, opens the possibility of problematizing both actual securitization and the absence of securitization, but it cannot do so by proving that something "is" a security problem—at least not without shifting from the role of analyst to securitizing actor. (Buzan et al., 1997)
Securitizing move
	•	A discourse that takes the form of presenting some-thing as an existential threat to a referent object does not by itself createsecuritization—this is a securitizing move, but the issue is securitized onlyif and when the audience accepts it as such. (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	If no signs of such acceptance exist, we can talkonly of a securitizing move, not of an object actually being securitized. (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	if one knows who can "do" security on what issue andunder what conditions, it will sometimes be possible to maneuver the interaction among actors and thereby curb security dilemmas. (Buzan et al., 1997)
Desecuritization
	•	desecuritization is the optimal long-rangeoption, since it means not to have issues phrased as "threats against whichwe have countermeasures" but to move them out of this threat-defensesequence and into the ordinary public sphere (Weaver 1995b). (Buzan et al., 1997)
Securitizing actor
	•	Securitizing actors: actors who securitize issues by declaring some-thing—a referent object—existentially threatened. (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	A securitizing actor is someone, or a group, who performs the security speech act. Common players in this role are political leaders, bureaucracies, governments, lobbyists, and pressure groups. (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	These actors are not usu-ally the referent objects for security, because only rarely can they speaksecurity though reference to the need to defend their own survival. Theirargument will normally be that it is necessary to defend the security of the state, nation, civilization, or some other larger community, principle, or system. (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	The notion of an "actor" is in itself problematic. To say precisely whoor what acts is always tricky, because one can disaggregate any collectiveinto subunits and on down to individuals and say, "It is not really 'the state'that acts but some particular department—or in the last instance individuals." (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	But to disaggregate everything into individuals is not very helpful,because much of social life is understandable only when collectivities areseen as more than the sum of their "members" and are treated as social real-ities (methodological collectivism). (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	Identifying actors is thus more complicated than identifying referentobjects. (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	be the actors, but if they are locked into strong roles it is usually more rele-vant to see as the "speaker" the collectivities for which individuals are des-ignated authoritative representatives (e.g., parties, states, or pressuregroups)—for example, France-materialized-as-de Gaulle rather than theperson de Gaulle. If one wants to downgrade the role of the analyst indefining actors, one option is to let other actors settle the matter. Otherstates treated de Gaulle as acting on behalf of France and held Franceresponsible for his acts; thus, in the world of "diplomatics" France wasconstituted as the actor (Manning 1962; Waver forthcoming-c). (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	Focusing onthe organizational logic of the speech act is probably the best way to identi-fy who or what is the securitizing actor. (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	the distinctions are contextualrather than intrinsic to specific units: In many cases, the securitizing actorswill be different from the referent object, but in others—most notably thestate—the referent object will in a sense speak for itself through its autho-rized representatives. (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	Security actors speak and act in the name of referent objects, and they generally see threats as emanating from other referentobjects. (Buzan et al., 1997)
Referent object
	•	Referent objects: things that are seen to be existentially threatenedand that have a legitimate claim to survival. (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	The referent object for security has traditionally been the state and, in amore hidden way, the nation. For a state, survival is about sovereignty, andfor a nation it is about identity (Waver et al. 1993, chapter 2). But if onefollows the securitization approach outlined earlier, a much more openspectrum of possibilities has to be allowed. (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	In principle, securitizing actorscan attempt to construct anything as a referent object. (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	The referent object is that to which one can point and say, "It hasto survive, therefore it is necessary to…”. (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	Referent objects must establish security legitimacy in terms of a claim to survival. (Buzan et al., 1997)
Functional actors
	•	Functional actors: actors who affect the dynamics of a sector.Without being the referent object or the actor calling for security onbehalf of the referent object, this is an actor who significantly influ-ences decisions in the field of security. A polluting company, forexample, can be a central actor in the environmental sector—it isnot a referent object and is not trying to securitize environmentalissues (quite the contrary). (Buzan et al., 1997)

Seducer
	•	With expert seducers who use all of the positive cues to mimic the appearance that they are falling in love only to bring you more deeply under their control, keep in mind that very few people naturally reveal so much emotion so early on. If your supposed effect on them seems a bit too rushed and perhaps contrived, tell them to slow down and monitor their face for microexpressions of frustration. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Le troisième facteur, qui est de loin le plus important pour G. Le Bon, c’est la « suggestibilité » (ibid.). Croyant s’engager alors sur le terrain ferme de la physiologie, il postule la quasi-identité de l’état de l’individu en foule avec l’état hypnotique. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Il n’est plus lui-même, mais un automate que sa volonté est devenue impuissante à guider ». (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	le manieur d’hommes qui exerce sur chacun une fascination que Le Bon appelle « la séduction ». C’est une autre manière de nommer le charisme des meneurs dont nous avons déjà parlé. (Mannoni, 1985)
Selection bias
	•	occurs when the worker cohort under study is not representative of the general population from which it comes and with which it will be compared. (Michaels, 2008)
Selective handicapping of adversarial rationality and knowledge (SHARK)
	•	The claim is that SHARK is viable (in both a cybernetic and political sense) as a basis for public risk management in at least some circumstances. In such a control system (according to Dunsire 1990,1992), a pre-set datum line, defined as “acceptable risk”, marks the preferred goal of management, and negative feedback mechanisms (inspectorates, hotlines, reporting and surveillance systems) are set up to compare the state of the system with the datum line and to make changes as the system starts to swing off-limits (Hood and Jones, 1996)
	•	SHARK can work only if it has a source of power in the form of immanently opposed forces that are capable of being locked into continuing conflict with one another (and can be prevented from giving up the struggle at the times when the balance tips against them) (Hood and Jones, 1996)
	•	SHARK means setting up the policy machinery in such a way that politicians, public and bureaucrats are forced to confront the issues and cannot practise “management avoidance”, however much they might wish to do so. SHARK does that by putting those actors in the position of balance-tippers whose weight controls the balance of pent-up opposed forces in the system (Hood and Jones, 1996)
	•	SHARK strategy for risk managers (however conceived) is one of opportunistic and shifting intervention, seeking “making extremes meet” social conditions wherever they are to be found. The policy skills involved are those of identifying a niche or a lever for influence in a structure of conflict (Hood and Jones, 1996)
	•	SHARK need not involve any permanent institutions or arrangements, but may operate as a way of shifting the “action” around the social landscape, with public funding or other resources moving from one fulcrum to another according to the conditions of the moment. (Hood and Jones, 1996)
	•	SHARK is likely to work best in conditions where there are institutionalized champions for each of the rival values (such as aggregate economic growth, public health, individual freedom), which clash in public risk management. (Hood and Jones, 1996)
	•	SHARK does not necessarily require exact institutional balance of the rival risk management values, and could develop by an iterative process of identifying the value trade-offs, exploiting the raw materials that are already to hand (Hood and Jones, 1996)
	•	SHARK needs to be built on role antagonisms with strong incentives to promote rival values (Hood and Jones, 1996)
	•	SHARK is less likely to break down through drift towards a “middle ground” if there are regular adversarial forums in which the risk management debate is conducted (Hood and Jones, 1996)
	•	SHARK model is that it fits with the confrontational dynamic of risk politics rather than trying to work against it. (Hood and Jones, 1996)
Self
	•	We can say that we humans have two contrary selves within us—a lower and a higher. (Greene, 2018)
	•	In constructing a self that we can hold on to and love, the key moment in its development occurs between the ages of two and five years old. (Greene, 2018)
	•	We all have a higher and a lower self. At certain moments in life, we can definitely feel one part or the other as the stronger. (Greene, 2018)
High self
	•	We feel the impulses of the higher self when we are drawn out of ourselves, wanting to connect more deeply with others, to absorb our minds in our work, to think instead of react, to follow our own path in life, and to discover what makes us unique. (Greene, 2018)
	•	The higher is the more truly human side of our nature, the side that makes us thoughtful and Self-aware. Because the higher impulse is weaker, connecting to it requires effort and insight. (Greene, 2018)
	•	We feel the impulses of the higher self when we are drawn out of ourselves, wanting to connect more deeply with others, to absorb our minds in our work, to think instead of react, to follow our own path in life, and to discover what makes us unique. (Greene, 2018)
	•	The higher is the more truly human side of our nature, the side that makes us thoughtful and Self-aware. Because the higher impulse is weaker, connecting to it requires effort and insight. (Greene, 2018)
	•	When we accomplish things, when we finish what we start, we can sense the outlines of this higher self. (Greene, 2018)
	•	It often takes great effort and awareness to tame this lower half and bring out the higher side; it is not our first impulse. (Greene, 2018)
Low self
	•	The lower tends to be stronger. Its impulses pull us down into emotional reactions and defensive postures, making us feel Self-righteous and superior to others. It makes us grab for immediate pleasures and distractions, always taking the path of least resistance. It induces us to adopt what other people are thinking, losing ourselves in the group. (Greene, 2018)
	•	The lower is the more animal and reactive side of our nature, and one that we easily slip into. (Greene, 2018)
	•	It often takes great effort and awareness to tame this lower half and bring out the higher side; it is not our first impulse. (Greene, 2018)
Self absorbtion
	•	The need to develop this empathy is greater than ever. Various studies have indicated a gradual increase in levels of Self-absorption and narcissism in young people since the late 1970s, with a much higher spike since 2000. Much of this can be attributed to technology and the internet. People simply spend less time in social interactions and more time socializing online, which makes it increasingly difficult to develop empathy and sharpen social skills. Like any skill, empathy comes through the quality of attention. If your attention is continually interrupted by the need to look at your smartphone, you are never really gaining a foothold in the feelings or perspectives of other people. You are continually drawn back to yourself, flitting about the surface of social interactions, never really engaging. Even in a crowd, you remain essentially alone. People come to serve a function—not to bond with but to placate your insecurities. (Greene, 2018)
	•	We see evidence of this in personal relationships as well. More and more people have come to believe that others should simply desire them for who they are. This means revealing as much as they can about themselves, exposing all of their likes and dislikes, and making themselves as familiar as possible. They leave no room for imagination or fantasy, and when the man or woman they want loses interest in them, they go online to rant at the superficiality of men or the fecklessness of women. Increasingly self-absorbed (see chapter 2), we find it harder than ever to get into the psychology of the other person, to imagine what they want from us instead of what we want from them. (Greene, 2018)
	•	People may point to all of this as evidence that we humans are becoming more honest and truthful, but human nature does not change within a few generations. People have become more obvious and forthright not out of some deep moral calling but out of increasing self-absorption and overall laziness. It requires no effort to simply be oneself or to blast one’s message. And the lack of effort simply results in a lack of effect on other people’s psychology. It means that people’s interest in you will be paper thin. Their attention will quickly move on and you will not see the reason for this. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Influence over people and the power that it brings are gained in the opposite way from what you might imagine. Normally we try to charm people with our own ideas, showing ourselves off in the best light. We hype our past accomplishments. We promise great things about ourselves. We ask for favors, believing that being honest is the best policy. What we do not realize is that we are putting all of the attention on ourselves. In a world where people are increasingly self-absorbed, this only has the effect of making others turn more inward in return and think more of their own interests rather than ours. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Realize as well that you are not as good as the idealized image of your self-opinion. Like everyone else, you can be quite self-absorbed and obsessed with your own agenda. With this awareness, you will not feel the need to be validated by others. Instead you will work at making yourself truly independent and concerned with the welfare of others, as opposed to staying attached to the illusion of your self-opinion. (Greene, 2018)
Self-absorbed nature
	•	Creating a self that we can love is a healthy development, and there should be no stigma attached to it. Without Self-esteem from within, we would fall into deep narcissism. But to move beyond functional narcissism, which should be our goal, we must first be honest with ourselves. Trying to deny our Self-absorbed nature, trying to pretend we are somehow more altruistic than others, makes it impossible for us to transform ourselves. (Greene, 2018)
Sel-awareness
	•	Confidence without Self-awareness and control can become grandiosity. Without conscious effort, these strengths will tend to wear down or turn into weaknesses. What this means is that the weakest parts of our character are the ones that create habits and compulsive behavior, because they do not require effort or practice to maintain. (Greene, 2018)
	•	This self-awareness has a physical component to it that you must be sensitive to. When you are doing activities that mesh with your natural inclinations, you feel ease in the effort. You learn faster. You have more energy and you can withstand the tedium that comes with learning anything important. When you take on too much, more than you can handle, you feel not only exhausted but also irritable and nervous. You are prone to headaches. When you have success in life, you will naturally feel a touch of fear, as if the good fortune could disappear. You sense with this fear the dangers that can come from rising too high(almost like vertigo) and feeling too superior. Your anxiety is telling you to come back down to earth. You want to listen to your body as it signals to you when you are working against your strengths. (Greene, 2018)
	•	In knowing yourself, you accept your limits. You are simply one person among many in the world, and not naturally superior to anyone. You are not a god or an angel but a flawed human like the rest of us. You accept the fact that you cannot control the people around you and no strategy is ever foolproof. Human nature is too unpredictable. With this self-knowledge and acceptance of limits you will have a sense of proportion. You will search for greatness in your work. And when you feel the pull to think more highly of yourself than is reasonable, this self-knowledge will serve as a gravity mechanism, pulling you back down and directing you toward the actions and decisions that will best serve your particular nature. (Greene, 2018)
Self-belief
	•	In ancient times, many great leaders, such as Alexander the Great and Julius Caesar, felt that they were descended from gods and part divine. Such self-belief would translate into high levels of confidence that others would feed off and recognize. It became a self-fulfilling prophecy. (Greene, 2018)
Self-control
	•	self-control requires attention and effort. (Kahneman, 2012)
Self-confidence
	•	This always helps to gain attention, and it neatly covers up their gaping inner emptiness and their fragmented sense of self. But beware if this confidence is ever truly put to the test. Greene, 2018)
	•	earlier, people often try to cover up their weaknesses by presenting them as something positive. We see them brimming with Self-confidence, only to later discover that they are actually arrogant and incapable of listening. They seem frank and sincere, but over time we realize that they are actually boorish and unable to consider the feelings of others. Or they seem prudent and thoughtful, but eventually we see that they are in fact timid at their core and afraid of the slightest criticism. People can be quite adept at creating these optical illusions, and we fall for them. Similarly, people will charm and flatter us and, blinded by our desire to like them, we fail to look deeper and see the character flaws. (Greene, 2018)
Self-confirming equilibrium
	•	In a self-confirming equilibrium, each player's strategy is a best response to his beliefs about the play of his opponents, and each player's beliefs are correct along the equilibrium path of play. (Fudenberg and Levine, 1993)
	•	if a self-confirming equilibrium occurs repeatedly, no player ever observes play that contradicts his beliefs, even though beliefs about play at off-path information sets need not be correct. (Fudenberg and Levine, 1993)
	•	self-confirming equilibrium, that weakens condition (ii) by requiring only that players' beliefs are correct along the equilibrium path of play. (Fudenberg and Levine, 1993)
	•	The concept of self-confirming equilibrium is motivated by the idea that noncooperative equilibria should be interpreted as the outcome of a learning process, in which players revise their beliefs using their observations of previous play. (Fudenberg and Levine, 1993)
	•	if a self-confirming equilibrium occurs repeatedly, no player ever observes play that contradicts his beliefs, so the equilibrium is "self-confirming" in the weak sense of not being inconsistent with the evidence. (Fudenberg and Levine, 1993)
	•	self-confirming equilibrium was developed to capture the implications of learning when players do little or none of this experimentation. (Fudenberg and Levine, 1993)
	•	self-confirming equilibrium is motivated by the idea of a dynamic learning process, such processes are not explicitly modelled in this paper. (Fudenberg and Levine, 1993)
	•	self-confirming equilibrium concept is to model the possibility that certain mistakes in beliefs can persist if not contradicted by the evidence, different assumptions about what the players observe would lead to alternative notions of equilibrium. (Fudenberg and Levine, 1993)
Self-destructive behavior
	•	We tend also to grab for things that offer immediate pleasure, even if we know about the negative long-term consequences. That is why people continue to smoke, drink, do drugs, or engage in any self-destructive behavior in which the destruction is not immediate and dramatic. (Greene, 2018)
	•	In a world that is complex, with myriad dangers that loom in the future, our short-term tendencies pose a continual threat to our well- being. And as our attention spans decrease because of technology, the threat is even greater. In many ways we are defined by our relationship to time. When we simply react to what we see and hear, when we swing from excitement and exuberance to fear and panic at each new piece of dramatic news, when we gear our actions toward gaining as much pleasure as possible in the moment without a thought for future consequences, we can say that we are giving in to our animal nature, to what is most primitive and potentially destructive in our neurological makeup. (Greene, 2018)
	•	On the one side we find people whose goal in life is to inhibit and control this life force. This leads them to self-destructive strategies. They have to limit their thoughts and remain true to ideas that have lost their relevance. They have to limit what they experience. Everything is about them and their petty needs and personal problems. They often become obsessed with a particular goal that dominates all of their thoughts—such as making money or getting attention. All of this renders them dead inside as they close themselves off to the richness of life and the variety of human experience. In this way they veer toward the soulless, an internal lack of depth and flexibility. (Greene, 2018)
Self-esteem
	•	Facing this dilemma from early childhood on, most of us come up with a solution that works quite well: we create a self, an image of ourselves that comforts us and makes us feel validated from within. This self is composed of our tastes, our opinions, how we look at the world, what we value. In building this Self-image, we tend to accentuate our positive qualities and explain away our flaws. We cannot go too far in this, for if our Self-image is too divorced from reality, other people will make us aware of the discrepancy, and we will doubt ourselves. But if it is done properly, in the end we have a self that we can love and cherish. Our energy turns inward. We become the center of our attention. When we experience those inevitable moments when we are alone or not feeling appreciated, we can retreat to this self and soothe ourselves. If we have moments of doubt and depression, our Self-love raises us up, makes us feel worthy and even superior to others. This Self-image operates as a thermostat, helping us to regulate our doubts and insecurities. We are no longer completely dependent on others for attention and recognition. We have self-esteem. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Creating a self that we can love is a healthy development, and there should be no stigma attached to it. Without Self-esteem from within, we would fall into deep narcissism. But to move beyond functional narcissism, which should be our goal, we must first be honest with ourselves. Trying to deny our Self-absorbed nature, trying to pretend we are somehow more altruistic than others, makes it impossible for us to transform ourselves. (Greene, 2018)
Self-fulfilling dynamic
	•	What we must understand about the attitude is not only how it colors our perceptions but also how it actively determines what happens to us in life—our health, our relations with people, and our success. Our attitude has a self-fulfilling dynamic. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Do not be afraid to exaggerate the role of willpower. It is an exaggeration with a purpose. It leads to a positive self-fulfilling dynamic, and that is all you care about. See this shaping of your attitude as your most important creation in life, and never leave it to chance. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Do not be afraid to exaggerate the role of willpower. It is an exaggeration with a purpose. It leads to a positive self-fulfilling dynamic, and that is all you care about. See this shaping of your attitude as your most important creation in life, and never leave it to chance. (Greene, 2018)
	•	As we get older, we tend to place limits on how far we can go in life. Over the years we internalize the criticisms and doubts of others. By accepting what we think to be the limits of our intelligence and creative powers, we create a self-fulfilling dynamic. They become our limits. You do not need to be so humble and self-effacing in this world. Such humility is not a virtue but is rather a value that people promote to help keep you down. Whatever you are doing now, you are in fact capable of much more, and by thinking that, you will create a very different dynamic. (Greene, 2018)
	•	In ancient times, many great leaders, such as Alexander the Great and Julius Caesar, felt that they were descended from gods and part divine. Such self-belief would translate into high levels of confidence that others would feed off and recognize. It became a self-fulfilling prophecy. (Greene, 2018)
Self-image
	•	Our natural response to reading or hearing about the darker qualities in human nature is to exclude ourselves. It is always the other person who is narcissistic, irrational, envious, grandiose, aggressive, or passive-aggressive. We almost always see ourselves as having the best intentions. If we go astray, it is the fault of circumstances or people forcing us to react negatively. The Laws will make you stop once and for all this Self-deluding process. We are all cut from the same cloth, and we all share the same tendencies. The sooner you realize this, the greater your power will be in overcoming these potential negative traits within you. You will examine your own motives, look at your own shadow, and become aware of your own passive-aggressive tendencies. This will make it that much easier to spot such traits in others. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Facing this dilemma from early childhood on, most of us come up with a solution that works quite well: we create a self, an image of ourselves that comforts us and makes us feel validated from within. This self is composed of our tastes, our opinions, how we look at the world, what we value. In building this Self-image, we tend to accentuate our positive qualities and explain away our flaws.

This Self-image operates as a thermostat, helping us to regulate our doubts and insecurities. We are no longer completely dependent on others for attention and recognition. We have self-esteem. (Greene, 2018)
	•	We generally take this Self-image completely for granted, like the air we breathe. It operates on a largely unconscious basis. (Greene, 2018)
Self-involvement
	•	To make matters worse, our culture tends to emphasize the supreme value of the individual and individual rights, encouraging greater Self-involvement. We find more and more people who cannot imagine that others have a different perspective, that we are all not exactly the same in what we desire or think. (Greene, 2018)
Self-love
	•	We are all prone to flattery because of our Self-love. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Creating a self that we can love is a healthy development, and there should be no stigma attached to it. Without Self-esteem from within, we would fall into deep narcissism. But to move beyond functional narcissism, which should be our goal, we must first be honest with ourselves. Trying to deny our Self-absorbed nature, trying to pretend we are somehow more altruistic than others, makes it impossible for us to transform ourselves. (Greene, 2018)
Self-mastery
	•	if you have no control, if you are continually emoting whatever comes to you in the moment, you will subtly signal weakness and an overall lack of Self-mastery.  (Greene, 2018)
Self-object
	•	When it comes to other people in their lives, deep narcissists have an unusual relationship that is hard for us to understand. They tend to see others as extensions of themselves, what is known as self-objects. People exist as instruments for attention and validation. Their desire is to control them like they control their own arm or leg. In a relationship, they will slowly make the partner cut off contact with friends—there must be no competition for attention. (Greene, 2018)
Self-opinion
	•	People have a perception about themselves that we shall call their self-opinion. This self-opinion can be accurate or not—it doesn’t matter. What matters is how people perceive their own character and worthiness. And there are three qualities to people’s self-opinion that are nearly universal: “I am autonomous, acting of my own free will”; “I am intelligent in my own way”; and “I am basically good and decent.” (Greene, 2018)
	•	we find that people have more personalized self-opinions that serve to regulate their particular insecurities. For instance, “I’m a free spirit, one of a kind” or “I’m very self-reliant and don’t need anybody’s help” or “I am good-looking and I can depend on that” or “I am a rebel and disdain all authority.” Implied in these various self-opinions is a feeling of superiority in this one area: “I am a rebel and you are less so.” Many of these types of self-opinions are related to developmental issues in early childhood. For instance, the rebel type had a father figure who disappointed him; or perhaps he suffered from bullying and cannot bear any feeling of inferiority. He must despise all authority. The self-reliant type may have experienced a very distant mother, be haunted by feelings of abandonment, and have crafted a self-image of rugged independence. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Our self-opinion is primary: it determines so much of our thinking and our values. We will not entertain ideas that clash with our self- opinion. Let us say we see ourselves as particularly tough and self-reliant. We will then gravitate toward ideas and philosophies that are realistic, hard-core, and unforgiving of others’ weaknesses. If in this scenario we also happen to be Christian, we will then reinterpret Christian religious doctrines to match our tough self-image, finding elements within Christianity that emphasize self-reliance, tough love, and the need to destroy our enemies. In general, we will choose to belong to groups that validate our feeling of being noble and smart. We might think we have particular ideas or values that stand on their own, but in fact they are dependent on our self-opinion. (Greene, 2018)
	•	When you try to convince people of something, one of three things will happen. First, you might inadvertently challenge a particular aspect of their self-opinion. In a discussion that might turn into an argument, you make them feel stupid or brainwashed or less than good. Even if you are subtle in your arguments, the implication is that you know better. If this happens, you make people even more defensive and resistant. Walls go up that will never come down.Second, you can leave their self-opinion in a neutral position— neither challenged nor confirmed. This often happens if you try to be reasonable and calm in your approach, avoiding any emotional extremes. In this scenario people remain resistant and dubious, but you have at least not tightened them up, and you have some room to maneuver them with your rational arguments.Third, you can actively confirm their self-opinion. In this case you are fulfilling one of people’s greatest emotional needs. We can imagine that we are independent, intelligent, decent, and self-reliant, but only other people can truly confirm this for us. And in a harsh and competitive world in which we are all prone to continual self-doubt, we almost never get this validation that we crave. When you give it to people, you will have the magical effect that occurred when you yourself were drunk, or at a rally, or in love. You will make people relax. No longer consumed by insecurities, they can direct their attention outward. Their minds open, making them susceptible to suggestion and insinuation. If they decide to help you, they feel like they are doing this of their own free will. (Greene, 2018)
	•	if you need a favor from people, do not remind them of what you have done for them in the past, trying to stimulate feelings of gratitude. Gratitude is rare because it tends to remind us of our helplessness, our dependence on others. We like to feel independent. Instead, remind them of the good things they have done for you in the past. This will help confirm their self-opinion: “Yes, I am generous.” (Greene, 2018)
	•	when it comes to your own self-opinion, try to have some ironic distance from it. Make yourself aware of its existence and how it operates within you. Come to terms with the fact that you are not as free and autonomous as you like to believe. You do conform to the opinions of the groups you belong to; you do buy products because of subliminal influence; you can be manipulated.  (Greene, 2018)
	•	Realize as well that you are not as good as the idealized image of your self-opinion. Like everyone else, you can be quite self-absorbed and obsessed with your own agenda. With this awareness, you will not feel the need to be validated by others. Instead you will work at making yourself truly independent and concerned with the welfare of others, as opposed to staying attached to the illusion of your self-opinion. (Greene, 2018)
Self-organizing process
	•	Cells or ecosystems are not ‘designed’ but nevertheless work in a robust way. Similarly, social groups and trends arise from an immense variety of different pressures and motivations but still display clear and definite shapes. The Internet and the WWW boomed without the presence of any regulating authority and were promoted by an enormous variety of unrelated agents: however, they usually work in a coherent and efficient way. All these are self-organized processes, i.e. phenomena in which order and organization are not the result of an external intervention or global blueprint but the outcome of local mechanisms or tendencies, iterated along thousands of interactions. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
	•	Network models are able to describe in a clear and natural way how self-organization arises in many systems. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
	•	With respect to social networks, politics, money, religion, language, and culture influence the relations between individuals, but when spaces of freedom are available, the shaping of these networks is not strictly planned. In all these cases, the overall organization of the systems emerges from the collective action of its elements, a bottom-up process of self-organization. This process may explain why many networks, even without being blueprinted, still display a remarkable signature of order like heterogeneity. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
	•	Understanding the origin of this self-organized order is one of the central challenges of the science of networks. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
	•	The range of possible network dynamics is extremely wide: network scientists have made measures, mathematical models, and computer simulations in order to grasp the basic mechanisms underlying this process, in the hope of understanding the principles of self-organization of these networks. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
Inter-mate choice
	•	Sociologists have found evidence of indirect mate choice in which people choose their partner not only on the basis of that individual’s personal features, but taking into account as well other people’s opinion. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
Self-protective political effort
	•	[…] self-protective political effort goes into protecting the system of knowledge with which it is identified (Douglas, 2005:32)
Self-rating
	•	Self-ratings are the simplest and best way to address some psychological phenomena (who knows better than the individual how much dread a perceived hazard evokes for him?), while in regard to other phenomena they are notoriously poor. (Wildavsky and Dake, 1990)
Self-righteousness
	•	Invariably in these cases people’s thinking is remarkably simple and lazy: kill Caesar and the Republic returns, action A leads to result B. A variation on this, one that is quite common in the modern world, is to believe that if people have good intentions, good things should be the result. If a politician is honest and means well, he or she will bring about the desired results. In fact, good intentions often lead to what are known as cobra effects, because people with the noblest intentions are often blinded by feelings of self-righteousness and do not consider the complex and often malevolent motivations of others. (Greene, 2018)
Self-worth
	•	From the moment we are born, we humans feel a never-ending need for attention. We are social animals to the core. Our survival and happiness depend on the bonds we form with others. If people do not pay attention to us, we cannot connect to them on any level. Some of this is purely physical—we must have people looking at us to feel alive. As those who have gone through long periods of isolation can attest, without eye contact we begin to doubt our existence and to descend into a deep depression. But this need is also deeply psychological: through the quality of attention we receive from others, we feel recognized and appreciated for who we are. Our sense of Self-worth depends on this. Because this is so important to the human animal, people will do almost anything to get attention, including committing a crime or attempting suicide. Look behind almost any action, and you will see this need as a primary motivation. (Greene, 2018)
Semantics
	•	In the case of semantics, the road to disciplinary status within linguistics has been long and complex, and it continues to sit uncomfortably within the structure of modem core linguistics. The basic sub-disciplines (phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax) are concerned with levels of formal patterning and the place of semantics within this essentially formalist hierarchy is far from clear. (Hutton, 1998)
	•	Semantics in England at the turn of the nineteenth century 'degenerated into an etymological frenzy, attested by a host of monographs on "words"' (Nehrlich, 1992: 2). The use of the word 'discovery' indicates a particular narrative perspective. (Hutton, 1998)
Modern semantics 
	•	One broad way in which modem semantics is defined is through the priority of the synchronic over the diachronic, frequently proclaimed as a foundational principle of modem linguistics. This implies the rejection of a central role for etymology within semantics, and the development of an autonomous approach to the study of meaning 'free from subservience to other disciplines' (Leech, 1981: 4). (Hutton, 1998)
	•	The key insight that modem semantics celebrates is the liberation of meaning from history. This liberation can be understood as the liberation of the spoken language from the tyranny of writing, and from the history of a language as a history of texts, and as the freeing of the ver- nacular from the domination of 'dead' or 'sacred' languages. Words are held to have meaning in the synchronic system and in their relationships with other words, not in their diachronic link to one of the languages of the past: 'the meaning is always now'. (Hutton, 1998)
Serenpidity
	•	the occurrence of something we are not expecting—(Greene, 2014)
Sensational headline
	•	Sensational headlines ("Thousands Dead!") following the Chernobyl acci- dent increased the memorability of that accident and the perceived catastrophic potential of nuclear power. (Kasperson et al., 1988)
Sense-making
	•	This is a continuous, iterative, largely informal effort by members of organizations to understand, or “make sense” of what is going on in the external environment that is relevant to their goals and needs. (Fishbein and Treverton, 2004)
	•	Sense-making involves the collective application of individual “intuition”— experience-based, sub-consciously processed judgment and imagination— to identify changes in existing patterns or the emergence of new patterns. (Fishbein and Treverton, 2004)
	•	Sense- making aggregates and refines intuitive judgment through conversations within the organization in which members construct interpretations of reality and develop explanations or stories to account for perceived anomalies. (Fishbein and Treverton, 2004)
Severity
	•	Severity is a measure of the extent of harm. (Cook, 2008)
	•	In system or functional safety management, the severity normally incorporates the number of victims as well as the level of harm to them. In health and safety management the number of victims can be considered separately to the level of harm. (Cook, 2008)
Sex
Contrasexual traits 
	•	We all possess hormones and genes of the opposite sex. These contrasexual traits are in the minority (to a greater or lesser extent, depending on the individual), but they are within us all and they form a part of our character. Equally significant is the influence on our psyche of the parent of the opposite sex, from whom we absorb feminine or masculine traits. (Greene, 2018)
	•	In our earliest years we were completely open and susceptible to the influence of others. The parent of the opposite sex was our first encounter with someone dramatically different from us. As we related to their alien nature, much of our personality was formed in response, becoming more dimensional and multifaceted. (With the parent of the same sex there is often a level of comfort and immediate identification that does not require the same adaptive energy). For instance, small boys are often comfortable expressing emotions and traits that they’ve learned from the mother, such as overt affection, empathy, and sensitivity. Small girls, conversely, are often comfortable expressing traits they’ve learned from the father, such as aggression,boldness, intellectual rigor, and physical prowess. Each child may also naturally possess these opposite-gender traits in him- or herself. In addition, each parent will also have a shadow side that the child must assimilate or deal with. For instance, a mother may be narcissistic rather than empathetic, and a father may be domineering or weak rather than protective and strong. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Children must adapt to this. In any event, the boy and the girl will internalize the positive and the negative qualities of the parent of the opposite sex in ways that are unconscious and profound. And the association with the parent of the opposite sex will be charged with all kinds of emotions—physical and sensual connections, tremendous feelings of excitement, fascination, or disappointment at what one was not given. (Greene, 2018)

Shadow
	•	The Shadow consists of all the qualities people try to deny about themselves and repress. This repression is so deep and effective that  people are generally unaware of their Shadow; it operates unconsciously. (Greene, 2018)
	•	According to Jung, this Shadow has a thickness to it, depending on how deep the level of repression and the number of traits that are being concealed. Nixon would be said to have a particularly thick Shadow. When we experience those moments when people reveal the dark side, we can see something come over their face; their voice and body language is altered—almost as if another person is confronting us, the features of the upset child suddenly becoming visible. We feel their shadow as it stirs and emerges. (Greene, 2018)
	•	The Shadow lies buried deep within, but it becomes disturbed and active in moments of stress, or when deep wounds and insecurities are triggered. It also tends to emerge more as people get older. When we are young, everything seems exciting to us, including the various social roles we must play. But later in life we tire of the masks we have been wearing, and the leakage is greater. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Because we rarely see the Shadow, the people we deal with are somewhat strangers to us. It is as if we only see a two-dimensional, flattened image of people—their pleasant social side. Knowing the contours of their Shadow makes them come to life in three dimensions. (Greene, 2018)
	•	The Shadow is created in our earliest years and stems from two conflicting forces that we felt. First, we came into this world bursting with energy and intensity. We did not understand the difference between acceptable and unacceptable behavior; we only experienced natural impulses. Some of these impulses were aggressive. We wanted to monopolize our parents’ attention and receive much more of it than our siblings. We experienced moments of great affection but also powerful dislikes and hatreds, even of our parents for not meeting our needs. We wanted to feel superior in some way and appreciated for it— in appearance, strength, or smartness. We could be remarkably selfish if we were denied what we wanted, and turn devious and manipulative to get it. We could even find some pleasure in hurting people, or fantasize about getting revenge. We experienced and expressed the full gamut of emotions. We were not the innocent angels people imagine children to be. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Much of this is essential for the smooth functioning of social life, but in the process a large part of our nature moved underground, into the Shadow. (Greene, 2018)
	•	If we accumulate a lot of hurts and resentments along the way, which we strive to conceal from others, the Shadow grows thicker. (Greene, 2018)
	•	If we experience success in our lives, we become addicted to positive attention, and in the inevitable down moments when the drug of such attention wears off, the Shadow will be disturbed and activated.  (Greene, 2018)
	•	Concealing this dark side requires energy; it can be draining to always present such a nice, confident front. And so the Shadow wants to release some of the inner tension and come back to life. (Greene, 2018)
	•	We lap up stories in the news of those who have been caught acting out in some way and enjoy the ensuing shaming. Serial killers and diabolical cult leaders enthrall us. With these shows and the news we can always become moralistic and talk of how much we despise such villains, but the truth is that the culture constantly feeds us these figures because we are hungry for expressions of the dark side. All of this provides a degree of release from the tension we experience in having to play the angel and seem so correct. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Stevenson’s idea is that the more civilized and moral we outwardly become, the more potentially dangerous is the Shadow, which we so fiercely deny. (Greene, 2018)
	•	The solution is not more repression and correctness. We can never alter human nature through enforced niceness. The pitchfork doesn’t work. Nor is the solution to seek release for our Shadow in the group, which is volatile and dangerous. Instead the answer is to see our Shadow in action and become more self-aware. It is hard to project onto others our own secret impulses or to overidealize some cause, once we are made aware of the mechanism operating within us. Through such self-knowledge we can find a way to integrate the dark side into our consciousness productively and creatively. (For more on this, see the last section of this chapter.) In doing so we become more authentic and complete, exploiting to the maximum the energies we naturally possess. (Greene, 2018)
	•	as the laws of human nature dictate, the deeper the repression, the greater the volatility of the Shadow. (Greene, 2018)
	•	The underlying weakness or antisocial trait is a key component of their Shadow—something denied and repressed. But as the laws of human nature dictate, the deeper the repression, the greater the volatility of the Shadow. As they get older or experience stress, there will be cracks in the façade. They are playing a role to the extreme, and it is tiring. Their real self will rebel in the form of moods, obsessions, secret vices, and behavior that is quite contrary to their image and is often self-destructive. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Conscious of our Shadow, we can control, channel, and integrate it. Aware of what we have lost, we can reconnect to that part of ourselves that has sunk into the Shadow. (Greene, 2018)
	•	This is the most difficult step in the process. The Shadow is something we deny and repress. It is so much easier to dig up and moralize about the dark qualities of others. It is almost unnatural for us to look inward at this side of ourselves. But remember that you are only half a human if you keep this buried. Be intrepid in this process. (Greene, 2018)
	•	The Shadow is talking to you in various ways. Don’t look for symbols or hidden meanings. Pay attention instead to the emotional tone and overall feelings that they inspire, holding on to them throughout the day. This could be unexpected bold behavior on your part, or intense anxiety spurred by certain situations, or sensations of being physically trapped or of soaring above it all, or exploring a place that is forbidden and beyond the boundaries. The anxieties could relate to insecurities you are not confronting; the soaring and exploring are hidden desires trying to rise to consciousness. Get in the habit of writing your dreams down and paying deep attention to their feeling tone. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Consider the Shadow as having depths that contain great creative energy. You want to explore these depths, which include more primitive forms of thinking and the darkest impulses that come out of our animal nature. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Most of the time we secretly suffer from the endless social codes we have to adhere to. We have to seem so nice and agreeable, always going along with the group. We better not show too much confidence or ambition. Seem humble and similar to everyone else; that’s how the game is played. In following this path we gain comfort by fitting in, but we also become defensive and secretly resentful. Being so nice becomes a habit, which easily turns into timidity, lack of confidence, and indecision. At the same time, our Shadow will show itself, but unconsciously, in explosive fits and starts, and often to our detriment. (Greene, 2018)
Shaman
	•	In primitive cultures around the world, the wisest man or woman in the tribe was the shaman, the healer who could communicate with the spirit world. The male shaman had an inner woman or wife whom he listened to closely and who guided him. The female shaman had the inner husband. The shamans’ power came from the depth of their communication with this inner figure, which was experienced as a real woman or man from within. The shaman figure reflects a profound psychological truth that our most primitive ancestors had access to. In fact, in the myths of many ancient cultures—Persian, Hebrew, Greek, Egyptian—original humans were believed to be both male and female; this made them so powerful that the gods feared them and split them in half. (Greene, 2018)
Shareholding
	•	An even stronger relation than lending money is given by shareholding, i.e. the direct participation of a company in another company’s capital. This means that the first company holds a part of the second one, and can exert influence on its main decisions. Shareholding is converted into control when a company holds the majority of stock, or when it is able to determine the vote of the majority of the board. In this case, legally independent companies are converted into a business group. Often, these groups display a pyramidal structure, where a holding company is at the top, and operating companies are at the bottom of the control hierarchy. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
Shatterbelts
	•	Among  the  most prominent  notions  in  spatial  analyses  of  conflict  is  that  certain  geographic  regions  are inherently more prone to conflict than other areas; such regions are often referred to as "shatterbelts." (Hensel and Diehl, 1994)
	•	The  concept  of  shatterbelts  originated  in  geopolitical  writings  in  the  early  20thcentury.  (Hensel and Diehl, 1994)
	•	The term "shatterbelt" generally refers to a geographic region that is plagued both by  local  conflicts  within  or  between  states  in  the  region,  and  by  the  involvement  of competing major powers from outside the region.  (Hensel and Diehl, 1994)
	•	Shatterbelt regions are often blamed for a large proportion of interstate conflict, particularly with respect to major power conflict. World  Wars  I  and  II,  the  Korean  War,  and  the  Vietnam  War--as  well  as  many  less prominent conflicts--are said to have begun in regions that are termed shatterbelts. (Hensel and Diehl, 1994)
	•	Shatterbelts represent more than just a way to categorize the spatial distribution of interstate conflict. They also could be a catalyst that drives conflicts up the escalatoryladder, making disputes more dangerous and broadening their scope. (Hensel and Diehl, 1994)
	•	Traditional analyses of geopolitics and international conflict have treated geography as either a "facilitating condition"  (e.g.,  geographic  proximity)  or  a  source  of  conflict  itself  (e.g., territorial disputes) (Diehl, 1991).  Shatterbelts may represent a combination of those two effects,and may offer a way of understanding how geography can provide the bases for conflict aswell as condition state behavior in that conflict. (Hensel and Diehl, 1994)
	•	Shatterbelts might also represent an appropriate domain for studying such conflict processes  as  contagion,  diffusion,  and  foreign  intervention,  considering  the  alleged propensity of shatterbelts to widen local conflicts into regional or extra-regional affairs. (Hensel and Diehl, 1994)
Shortsightness
	•	It is in the animal part of your nature to be most impressed by what you can see and hear in the present—the latest news reports and trends, the opinions and actions of the people around you, whatever seems the most dramatic. This is what makes you fall for alluring schemes that promise quick results and easy money. This is also what makes you overreact to present circumstances—becoming overly exhilarated or panicky as events turn one direction or the other. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Learn to measure people by the narrowness or breadth of their vision; avoid entangling yourself with those who cannot see the consequences of their actions, who are in a continual reactive mode. They will infect you with this energy. Your eyes must be on the larger trends that govern events, on that which is not immediately visible. Never lose sight of your long-term goals. With an elevated perspective, you will have the patience and clarity to reach almost any objective. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Although this stands as an ideal, we must admit that such a perspective is rare among us humans. It seems to require an effort that is almost beyond us. The reason for this is simple: short-term thinking is hardwired into our system; we are built to respond to what is immediate and to seek out instant gratification. For our early human ancestors, it paid to notice what was potentially dangerous in the environment or what offered an opportunity for food. The human brain as it evolved was designed not to examine the full picture and context of an event but to home in on the most dramatic features. This worked well in a relatively simple environment and amid the simple social organization of the tribe. But it is not suited to the complex world we now live in. It makes us take notice mostly of what stimulates our senses and emotions, and miss much of the larger picture. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Our brains are designed to make us notice what could immediately harm us in our surroundings but not to pay great attention to other dangers looming in the future that are more abstract. This is why we tend to give much more attention to something like terrorism (immediate pain), which certainly deserves our scrutiny, than to global warming (distant pain), which in fact represents the greater danger since it puts the very survival of the planet at risk. But such a danger seems abstract in the present. By the time it becomes not abstract at all, it might be too late. (Greene, 2018)
	•	In a world that is complex, with myriad dangers that loom in the future, our short-term tendencies pose a continual threat to our well- being. And as our attention spans decrease because of technology, the threat is even greater. In many ways we are defined by our relationship to time. When we simply react to what we see and hear, when we swing from excitement and exuberance to fear and panic at each new piece of dramatic news, when we gear our actions toward gaining as much pleasure as possible in the moment without a thought for future consequences, we can say that we are giving in to our animal nature, to what is most primitive and potentially destructive in our neurological makeup. (Greene, 2018)
	•	When we strive to go against this grain, to consider more deeply the consequences of what we do and the nature of our long-term priorities, we are straining to realize our true human potential as the thinking animal. And just as short-term thinking can be contagious, one individual who embodies the wisdom of the farsighted perspective can have an immensely positive effect on the people around him or her. Such individuals make us aware of the larger picture and reveal a mind-set that we recognize as superior. We want to imitate them. (Greene, 2018)
	•	If possible, avoid deep contact with those whose time frame is narrow, who are in continual react mode, and strive to associate with those with an expanded awareness of time. (Greene, 2018)
Skepticism
	•	try to maintain a perfect balance between skepticism (rider) and curiosity (horse). (Greene, 2018)
	•	suspicions. When the explanation or the come-on is just a little too slick or professional, that is what should trigger your skepticism. (Greene, 2018)
Signal
	•	Sources and signals are not independent entities but are perceived as a unit by the receiver who links the signal to the sources or transmitters and draws inferences about the relationship between the two. (Kasperson et al., 1988)
	•	Signals arise through direct personal experience with a risk object or through the receipt of information about the risk object. (Kasperson et al., 1988)
	•	These signals are processed by social, as well as individual, amplification "stations," which include the following: The scientist who conducts and communicates the technical assessment of risk; The risk-management institution; The news media; Activist social organizations; Opinion leaders within social groups; Personal networks of peer and reference groups; Public agencies. (Kasperson et al., 1988)
	•	signals about a risk event initiate a process whereby the significance of theevent is examined. If found to be ominous, these implications are likely to trigger higher-order social and economic impacts. (Kasperson et al., 1988)
Signal concept 
	•	An important concept that has emerged from psychometric research is that the seriousness and higher order impact of an unfortunate event are determined, in part, by what that event signals or portends (28). The informativeness or "signal potential" of an event, and thus its potential social impact, appears to be systematically related to the characteristics of the hazard and the location of the event within the factor space described earlier. (Slovic, 1987)
	•	The concept of accidents as signals was eloquently expressed in an editorial addressing the tragic accident at Bhopal (Slovic, 1987)
	•	One implication of the signal concept is that effort and expense beyond that indicated by a cost-benefit analysis might be warranted to reduce the possibility o f "high-signal accidents." (Slovic, 1987)

Mixed signal
	•	A mixed signal was one where a signal of potential danger was followed by signals that all was well, convincing engineers that the problem had been successfully diagnosed, corrected, and thus, that the component was an acceptable risk. (Gummer, 1998)
	•	Pay great attention to any mixed signals you pick up: a person professes to love your idea, but their face shows tension and their tone of voice is strained; or they congratulate you on your promotion, but the smile is forced and the expression seems sad. Such mixed signals are very common. They can also involve different parts of the body. (Greene, 2018)
	•	With mixed signals, you need to be aware that a greater part of nonverbal communication involves the leakage of negative emotions, and you need to give greater weight to the negative cue as indicative of the person’s true feelings. At some point, you can then ask yourself why they might feel sadness or antipathy. (Greene, 2018)
	•	by sending mixed signals, by showing qualities that are ever so slightly contrary, you cause people to pause in their instant categorizations and to think about who you really are. The more they think about you, the larger and more authoritative your presence. (Greene, 2018)
Weak signal
	•	A weak signal was one that was unclear, or one that, after analysis, seemed such an improbable event that engineers believed there was little probability of it recurring. (Gummer, 1998)
High-signal events
	•	High-signal events suggest that a new risk has appeared or that the risk is different and more serious than previously understood. (Kasperson et al., 1988)
	•	A small accident in an unfamiliar system (or one perceived as poorly understood), such as a nuclear reactor or a recombinant-DNA laboratory, however, may elicit great public concern if it is interpreted to mean that the risk is not well understood, not controllable, or not competently managed, thus implying that further (and possibly worse) mishaps are likely. (Kasperson et al., 1988)
	•	Thus an accident that takes many lives may produce relatively little social disturbance (beyond that experi- enced by the victims' families and friends) if it occurs as part of a familiar and well-understood system (such as a train wreck). (Kasperson et al., 1988)
	•	high signal value might be linked to the potential for second-order effects, and hence may provide a rationale in specific cases for stricter regulation of such risks. (Kasperson et al., 2003)
	•	high signal value in terms of serving as a warning signal for society, providing new information about the probability that similar or even more destructive mishaps might occur with this type of activity. (Kasperson et al., 2003)

Routine signal
	•	Routine signals are those that occur frequently. (Gummer, 1998)

Transmitters of signals
	•	Transmitters of signals may detect amplification arising from each message component. A factual statement repeated several times, especially if by different sources, tends to elicit greater belief in the accuracy of the information. An elaborate description of the inference process may distract attention from the accuracy of the underlying assumptions. (Kasperson et al., 1988)

Signal Value
	•	An important concept that has emerged from research on risk perception is that the seriousness and higher-order impacts of a risk event are determined, in part, by what that event signals or portends. The informativeness or "signal value" of an event appears t o be systematically related to the characteristics of the event and the hazard it reflects. (Kasperson et al., 1988)

Risk signal
	•	Risk signals were denned as "messages about a hazard or hazard event that affect people's perceptions about the seriousness or manageability of the risk." (Kasperson et al., 2003)
	•	The act of communication requires that the risk is translated into various ‘risk signals’ (images, symbols and signs) that will interact with a variety of psycholog- ical, social, institutional or cultural processes and this will result in the intensification or dampening of the perceptions of the risk and its manageability. (Breakwell, 2014)
	•	Hazards generate different signals (i.e. messages embedded in sym- bols, metaphors and images) over time […]. (Breakwell, 2014)
	•	some hazards have greater ‘signal strength’. (Breakwell, 2014)
Signal to noise concept 
	•	strategic surprise literature is part of the Security Studies subfield of Political Science, and consists of analyses of successful military surprise attacks and the reasons for the failure to prevent them. (Marrin, 2004)
Silence
	•	Your silence or lack of overt direction of the message will allow people to run wild with their own stories and interpretations. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Keep in mind that talking too much is a type of overpresence that grates and reveals weakness. Silence is a form of absence and withdrawal that draws attention; it spells self-control and power; when you do talk, it has a greater effect. In a similar fashion, if you commit a mistake, do not overexplain and overapologize. (Greene, 2018)
Sudden silence
	•	Sudden silence can say a lot. (Greene, 2018)
	•	You have said something that triggers a twinge of envy or dislike, and they cannot help but lapse into silence and brood. They may try to hide this with a smile as they inwardly fume. As opposed to simple shyness or having nothing to say, you will detect definite signs of irritation. In this case, it is best to notice this a few times before coming to any conclusions. (Greene, 2018)
Silent majority
	•	Pour J. Baudrillard le flou est encore plus marqué, et, pour lui, les « majorités silencieuses » ne sont qu’un « référent spongieux, (...) réalité opaque et translucide à la fois, (...) (qui renvoient à) ce néant : les masses ». (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Si l’on regarde autour de soi on ne voit, de toutes parts, que des masses. Qu’on s’efforce de les distinguer des foules ou des publics (H. Blumer, 1946), qu’on les appelle « hordes sauvages » (S. Freud), « hordes politiques » (B. Edelman, 1981) ou « majorités silencieuses ». (Mannoni, 1985)
Sincerity
	•	Projecting sincerity and honesty always plays well. A few public confessions of your weaknesses and vulnerabilities will do the trick. For some reason people see signs of humility as authentic, even though people might very well be simulating them. Learn how to occasionally lower your head and appear humble. If dirty work must be done, get others to do it. Your hands are clean. Never overtly play the Machiavellian leader—that only works well on television. Use the appropriate dominance cues to make people think you are powerful, even before you reach the heights. You want to seem like you were destined for success, a mystical effect that always works. (Greene, 2018)
Site characterization
	•	Site characterization for any modeling study includes examining all data on the site, such as source characteriration: dimensions and topography of the site, location of receptor populations, meteorology, soils. geohydrology, and ranges and distributions of chemical concentrations. (Paustenbach, 2002a)
Situational element
	•	Situational elements are those characteristics of the facility that create an environment that is more or less conducive to certain types of crimes or security violations. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	Situational elements also include the nature of the activities that occur on the property. Businesses face different problems than residential areas. (Vellani, 2007)
Six Ts Strategy
Toleration strategy
	•	The strategy of toleration might be known elsewhere as one of assumption or acceptance, but these terms are often confused with taking the risk, which implies pursuit of a positive risk. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Tolerating the risk would eschew any control on the risk (although this should not imply forgetting about the risk). We could choose to tolerate the risk, even if it were higher than our threshold for intolerability, if we were to decide that the benefit of controlling the risk would not be justified by the cost of controlling the risk. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Tolerating the risk means eschewing any additional control but is not the same as eschewing any management of the risk. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Tolerating the risk should imply any additional control but is not the same as eschewing any management of the risk.
	•	Tolerating the risk should imply either watching or retaining the risk, either of which might be treated elsewhere as a separate strategy but is properly treated as an option within the strategy of tolerating the risk. (Newsome, 2013)
Watch strategy
	•	While we tolerate a risk, we should watch the risk in case the risk changes. Such a watch implies, in practice, periodic reassessment of the risk level. If the risk were to fall, we would feel more justified in tolerating the risk. If the risk were to rise, we should consider a new strategy (probably treat the risk). (Newsome, 2013)
Retain strategy
	•	A strategy of “retaining the risk” implies that the owner of the risk is holding or building reserves against the potential negative returns. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Retaining the risk is the main alternative to transferring the risk to some outside actor (such as an insurer or partner). (Newsome, 2013)
Termination strategy
	•	If we were to decide that we could not tolerate a risk, we should treat the risk. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Treatening the risk means the application of some control to a risk in order to reduce the risk, ideally to a tolerable level, possibly until we terminate the risk. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	A strategy of termination includes prevention of things like the threat’s intent or capabilities or our exposure to threats (see below). Prevention might be defined elsewhere as treating the risk (see, for instance, Heerkens, 2002, p. 150), but prevention implies termination of the risk. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Opportunities to terminate the risk are often forgotten in the haste to prevent the risk growing. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Termination is attractive because we could eliminate the risk entirely. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	[…] treating or terminating the risk can be achieved in four main ways: reducing our exposure ot the source: reducing the source’s threatening intent; reducing the source’s threatening capbailities; or reducing the potential negative effects of an event. (Newsome, 2013)
Reducing exposure strategy
	•	reducing our exposure to the sources of risk would reduce their opportunities to harm us. Reducing exposure involves any of four sub-strategies: deferring our exposure to the sources; avoid exposure; withdrawing from exposure; or containing the hazard. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Reducing risk involves identifying countermeasures that can mitigate vulnera- bilities through the implementation of additional security measures or chang- ing security measures. (Vellani, 2007)
Defer
	•	We could choose to defer our acceptance of the risk. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	The word defer implies that we are not currently exposed to the risk but that we reserve the option to undertake the risk at a later point. (Newsome, 2013)
Avoid
	•	The word avoid implies that we want to do something without exposing ourselves to a negative risk. (Newsome, 2013)
Withdraw
	•	A strategy of withdrawing from the risk implies that we are currently exposed to the risk, but we choose to stop our exposure to the risk. (Newsome, 2013)
Containing
	•	Containing the hazard could be achieved by preventing the hazard from reaching us, or preventing ourselves from coinciding with the hazard. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Sometimes, containment temporarily contains a hazard until it returns to its threatening state. Worse, containment could strengthen the hazard. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Sometimes, an attempt to contain a hazard might reduce the frequency of minor events but not all events. (Newsome, 2013)
Reduce intent strategy
	•	Since a threat necessarily must have intent and capability to harm us, we could keep a hazard in its hazardous state or return a threat to it hazardous state by terminating the source’s threatening intent. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	The thre main substrategies are reduce the causes of the activation of such intent; deter intent; and reform intent. (Newsome, 2013)
Reduce the cause of activation
	•	Prevention is particularly appropriate in domains such as preventable diseases. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Prevention is attractive in international relations, too, where the negative returns can be enormous. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Proactive control of some causes of activation may activate other threats. (Newsome, 2013)
Detering the threat
	•	Deterring the threat means dissuading the hazard from becoming a threat. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Detterring the threats would reduce the frequency of negative events. (Newsome, 2013)
Reduce capabilities
	•	Reducing threatgening capability incolves controlling the hazard’s acquisition of capability or reducint the threat’s acquired capabilities. (Newsome, 2013)
Counter the acquisition of capabilities
	•	Preventing the potential aggressor from acquiring the capabilities to threaten us is the objective behind the many strategies called “counter-profilferation”, which aim to reduce the supply of arms to hazardous actors (such as undriendly states, insurgents, and terrorists). (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Countering acquisition is easy to confuse with containing the hazard but is not the same strategy. (Newsome, 2013)
Reduce acquired capabiltiies
	•	Once the threat has acquired threatening capabilities, we could aim to reduce those capabilities by removing damaging, or destroying them. (Newsome, 2013)
Controlling negative effects
	•	We could control or reduce the negative effects that would arise from a potential event. Termination of the risk would be achieved if we went so far as to prevent any negatice effects from the threat’s capabilities. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Controlling the negative effects is a strategy that could be known by many other words that are more precise, such as defense, deterrence, protection, and preparedness. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	The strategy of controlling the negative effects is known by (undortunately) nine other terms that are highly synonymous but rarely admit their common objective or the existence of other synonyms, and are often poorly defined: protecting the targets, preparing to defend or protect against the threat, planning for contingencies, mitigating the negative returns, managing consequences, building resilience against disruption, responding to the event, continuing operations despite the event, or recovering from the event. (Newsome, 2013)
Skill
Acquisition of skills
	•	The acquisition of skills requires a regular environment, an adequate opportunity to practice, and rapid and unequivocal feedback about the correctness of thoughts and actions. When these conditions are fulfilled, skill eventually develops, and the intuitive judgments and choices that quickly come to mind will mostly be accurate. (Kahneman, 2012)

Smallpox
	•	Smallpox was the first disease to be eradicated, in 1976. (Coker, 2009)
Smart
	•	‘smart’ for individual skills, private ends, unpredicted and ingenious solutions (Freilich 1980) (Douglas, 2005:134)
Smile
	•	less, frequent smiling being a sign of overall insecurity. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Smiles can also be a subtle cue for indicating superiority, especially through what we shall call the tight smile. (Greene, 2018)
Genius smile
	•	In developing your skills in this arena, you must learn to distinguish between the fake and the genuine smile. (Greene, 2018)
	•	The genuine smile will affect the muscles around the eyes and widen them, often revealing crow’s-feet on the sides of the eyes. It will also tend to pull the cheeks upward. There is no genuine smile without a definite change in the eyes and cheeks. Some people will try to create the impression of the genuine variety by putting on a very broad smile, which will partially alter the eyes as well. So in addition to the physical signs, you must look at the context. The genuine smile usually comes from some action or words that suddenly elicit the response; it is spontaneous. (Greene, 2018)
Tight smile
	•	Smiles can also be a subtle cue for indicating superiority, especially through what we shall call the tight smile. This usually comes in response to something someone said, and it is a smile that tightens the facial muscles and indicates irony and contempt for the person they see as inferior but gives them the cover of appearing friendly. (Greene, 2018)

Snob
	•	These types have a tremendous need to be different from others, to assert some form of superiority over the mass of mankind. They have the most refined aesthetic tastes when it comes to art, or film criticism, or fine wines, or gourmet food, or vintage punk rock records. They have amassed impressive knowledge of these things. They put a lot of emphasis on appearances—they are more “alternative” than others, their tattoos are more unique. (Greene, 2018)
	•	In many cases, they seem to come from very interesting backgrounds, perhaps with some exciting ancestry. Everything surrounding them is extraordinary. Of course, it later comes out that they were exaggerating or downright lying about their background. (Greene, 2018)
	•	The truth is that banality is part of human existence. Much of our lives is spent doing the most boring and tedious tasks. For most of us, our parents had normal, unglamorous jobs. We all have mediocre sides to our character and skills. Snobs are especially sensitive about this, greatly insecure about their origins and possible mediocrity. Their way of dealing with this is to distract and deceive with appearances (as opposed to real originality in their work), surrounding themselves with the extraordinary and with special knowledge. Underneath it all is the real person waiting to come out—rather ordinary and not so very different. (Greene, 2018)
Social
	•	ce n’est pas parce qu’il y a du social qu’il y a du collectif, mais bien parce qu’il y a du collectif (politique, historique, culturel) qu’il y a du social. (Mannoni, 1985)
Social amplification of risk
	•	hazards interact with psychological, social, institutional, and cultural processes in ways that may amplify or attenuate public responses to the risk or risk event. (Kasperson et al., 1988)
	•	Amplification occurs at two stages: in the transfer of information about the risk, and in the response mechanisms of society. Signals about risk are processed by individual and social amplification stations, including the scientist who communicates the risk assessment, the news media, cultural groups, interpersonal networks, and others. (Kasperson et al., 1988)
	•	The amplified risk leads to behavioral responses, which, in turn, result in secondary impacts. (Kasperson et al., 1988)
	•	social amplification provides a corrective mechanism by which society acts to bring the technical assessment of risk more in line with a fuller determination of risk. (Kasperson et al., 1988)
	•	amplification and attenuation, through serious disjunctures between expert and public assessments of risk and varying responses among different publics, confound conventional risk analysis. (Kasperson et al., 1988)
	•	The concept of social amplification of risk can, in principle, provide the needed theoretical base for a more comprehensive and powerful analysis of risk and risk management in modern societies. (Kasperson et al., 1988)
	•	In communications theory, amplification denotes the process of intensifying or attenuating signals during the transmission of information from an information source, to intermediate transmitters, and finally to a receiver. (Kasperson et al., 1988) 
	•	Amplification of signals occurs during both transmission and reception. The transmitter structures the messages that go to a receiver. The receiver, in turn, interprets, assimilates, and evaluates the messages. But a transmitter, it should be noted, is also a new information source-one that transcribes the original message from the source into a new message and sends it on to the receiver, according to institutional rules, role requirements, and anticipated receiver interests. Signals passing through a transmitter may therefore, be amplified twice-during the reception of information and in recoding. (Kasperson et al., 1988)
	•	Signal amplification in communications, then, occupies a useful niche in the overall structure of the social amplification of risk. (Kasperson et al., 1988)
	•	Social amplification of risk denotes the phenomenon by which information processes, institutional structures, social-group behavior, and individual responses shape the social experience of risk, thereby contributing to risk consequences (Fig. 1). The inter- action between risk events and social processes makes clear that, as used in this framework, risk has meaning only to the extent that it treats how people think about the world and its relationships. Thus there is no such thing as "true" (absolute) and "distorted" (socially determined) risk. Rather the information system and characteristics of public response that compose social amplification are essential elements in determining the nature and magnitude of risk. (Kasperson et al., 1988)
	•	A full-fledged theory of the social amplification of risk should ultimately explain why specific risks and risk events undergo more or less amplification or attenuation. (Kasperson et al., 1988) 
	•	Whether such a theory will carry the power to predict the specific kinds of public responses and the anatomy of social controversy that will follow the introduction of new risks must await the test of time. It may prove possible to identify and classify attributes of the risk source and of the social arena that heighten or attenuate the public response to risk. (Kasperson et al., 1988)
	•	The concept of social amplification of risk is hence dynamic, taking into account the learning and social interactions resulting from experience with risk. (Kasperson et al., 1988)
	•	The same graphic representation demonstrates the possibility that so- cial amplification may, quantitatively and qualita- tively, increase the direct impacts. (Kasperson et al., 1988)
	•	Social amplification of risk, in our current conceptualization, involves two major stages (or amplifiers)—the transfer of information about the risk or risk event, and the response mechanisms of society. (Kasperson et al., 1988)
	•	The roots of social amplification lie in the social experience of risk, both in direct personal experience and in indirect, or secondary, experience, through information received about the risk, risk events, and management systems. (Kasperson et al., 1988) 
	•	The interpretation and response to information flow form the second major stage of social amplification of risk. These mechanisms involve the social, institutional, and cultural contexts in which the risk information is interpreted, its meaning diagnosed, and values attached. (Kasperson et al., 1988)
	•	Understanding this phenomenon is a prerequisite essential for assessing the poten- tial impacts of projects and technologies, for establishing priorities in risk management, and for setting health and environmental standards. (Kasperson et al., 1988)
	•	An important proposition of the social amplification framework was that amplification or attenuation ofperceptions might feed into secondary "ripple" economic, social, or symbolic (e.g. stigma) consequences. (Pidgeon et al., 2003)
	•	people can experience both amplification and attenuation of risk perceptions in participatory settings. (Pidgeon et al., 2003)
	•	the important inference that risk amplification and attenuation can be made a deliberate subject of discursive activities with participatory risk management procedures. Such discourse helps people to realize that it is normal, but also detrimental to prudent judgment, if one selects and transmits only those pieces of information that one likes, if one amplifies signals that support one's own view and attenuates those that do not. (Pidgeon et al., 2003)
	•	The social amplification of risk framework (Kasperson, Renn, Slovic et al. 1988) seeks to forge links between the technical assessment of risk and psychological, sociological, and cultural perspectives on risk per- ception and risk related behavior. (Poumadère and Mays, 2003)
	•	the very process of risk amplification and attenuation appears as an implicit strategy of collective adaptation or coping with dange. (Poumadère and Mays, 2003)
	•	The theoretical foundations of SARF are developed in five principal publications (Kasperson, Renn, Slovic et al. 1988; Renn 1991a; Kasperson 1992; Burns et al. 1993; Kasperson and Kasperson 1996). (Kasperson et al., 2003)
	•	The idea arose out of an attempt to overcome the fragmented nature of risk perception and risk communication research by developing an inte- grative theoretical framework capable of accounting for findings from a wide range of studies, including: from media research; from the psycho- metric and cultural schools of risk perception research; and from studies of organizational responses to risk. (Kasperson et al., 2003)
	•	The framework also serves, more narrowly, to describe the various dynamic social processes underlying risk perception and response. In particular, those processes by which certain hazards and events that experts assess as relatively low in risk can become a particular focus of concern and sociopolitical activity within a society (risk amplification), while other hazards that experts judge more serious receive comparatively less attention from society (risk attenuation). (Kasperson et al., 2003)
	•	The theoretical starting-point is the assumption that "risk events," which might include actual or hypothesized accidents and incidents (or even new reports on existing risks), will be largely irrelevant or localized in their impact unless human beings observe and communicate them to others (Luhmann 1979). (Kasperson et al., 2003)
	•	SARF holds that, as a key part of that com- munication process, risk, risk events, and the characteristics of both become portrayed through various risk signals (images, signs, and symbols), which in turn interact with a wide range of psychological, social, institutional, or cultural processes in ways that intensify or attenuate perceptions ofrisk and its manageability (see figure 1.1). (Kasperson et al., 2003)
	•	The experience of risk there- fore is not only an experience of physical harm but the result of processes by which groups and individuals learn to acquire or create interpretations ofrisk. These interpretations provide rules of how to select, order, and ex- plain signals emanating from the physical world (Renn, Burns, Kasperson et al. 1992, p. 140). (Kasperson et al., 2003)
	•	With this framework, risk experience can be properly assessed only through the interaction among the physical harms attached to a risk event and the social and cultural processes that shape interpretations of that event, secondary and tertiary consequences that emerge, and the actions taken by managers and publics. (Kasperson et al., 2003)
	•	The authors adopt the metaphor of amplification from classical com- munications theory and use it to analyze the ways in which various social agents generate, receive, interpret, and pass on risk signals. Kasperson et al. (1988) argue that such signals are subject to predictable transfor- mations as they filter through various social and individual amplification stations. Such transformations can increase or decrease the volume of in- formation about an event, heighten the salience of certain aspects of a message, or reinterpret and elaborate the available symbols and images, thereby leading to particular interpretations and responses by other par- ticipants in the social system. (Kasperson et al., 2003)
	•	social amplification can also account for the observation that some events will produce "ripples" of secondary and tertiary consequences that may spread far be- yond the initial impact of the event and may even eventually impinge upon previously unrelated technologies or institutions. (Kasperson et al., 2003)
	•	SARF is by design inclusive and integrative. (Kasperson et al., 2003)
	•	The social amplification of risk framework was proposed to explain why "risk events with minor physical consequences often elicit strong public concern and produce extraordinarily severe social impacts" (Kasperson, Renn, Slovic et al. 1988). (Frewer, 2003)
	•	how risk events, through social and psychological processes, can be amplified, or indeed dampened, and as a result can lead to a ripple of different consequences at various levels (for instance, economic, legal, cultural). (Breakwell, 2014)
	•	The Social Amplification of Risk Framework (SARF) describes both the social and individual factors that act to amplify or attenuate perceptions of risk and then generate secondary effects such as regulatory changes, economic losses or stigmatis- ation of technologies. (Breakwell, 2014)
	•	The SARF was first proposed in 1988 by Roger Kasperson, Ortwin Renn, Paul Slovic, Halina Brown, Jacques Emel, Robert Goble, Jeanne Kasperson and Samuel Ratick and has been subsequently elaborated (Kasperson et al., 1988; Renn, 1991; Kasperson, 1992; Burns et al., 1993; Kasperson and Kasperson, 1996; Kasperson et al., 2003). (Breakwell, 2014)
	•	The framework particularly focuses upon the dynamic social processes that underlie risk perception and decisions. It highlights that certain events or hazards, which experts would state are relatively low in risk, can nevertheless become a focus of societal concern (risk amplification), whereas other hazards, which experts judge as more serious, attract less public attention (risk attenuation). (Breakwell, 2014)
	•	The SARF proposes that risks (or risk events, which can be either real or hypothesised) will have an impact not only through their primary physical effects but also, and often more importantly, through the way people communicate them to others. (Breakwell, 2014)
	•	While the framework does not emphasise particularly the way individuals, through their interactions, can amplify or attenuate a risk, they certainly can and much of the way institutions reshape risk reactions is mediated through inter- personal processe. (Breakwell, 2014) 
	•	[…] SARF itself is not a theory and specifies no unambiguous testable hypotheses (Breakwell, 2014)
	•	Machlis and Rosa (1990) and Rosa (1998, 2003) suggested that the SARF could be used to explain how desired risks or deliberate risk-taking are interpreted. (Breakwell, 2014)
	•	In the SARF, which focuses upon the significance of interpretation of risk through communication, it is inevitable that the mass media might be expected to play a fundamental role. (Breakwell, 2014)
	•	SARF specifies that organisations and institutions will play a role in amplification and attenuation of risk events but will also be the recipients of the impacts, through the ripple effects, of those events. (Breakwell, 2014)
	•	the process of amplification/attenuation is one that occurs through the interaction of many communicators (many stations). (Breakwell, 2014)
	•	According to SARF, risk events have real consequences and these may be direct (the physical changes induced) and indirect (derived from the social processing of the risk – stigmatisation, group conflict, loss of trust, etc.). (Breakwell, 2014)
	•	there is a tendency in SARF expositions to avoid dealing with the question of whether the risk is ‘real’ by dealing with whether its consequences are ‘real’. (Breakwell, 2014)
	•	Rosa proposes that SARF should clearly embrace a realist definition of risk as its starting point (based on ontological realism – i.e. the assumption that the world exists independent of percipient actors) and then be explicit about the social and cognitive processes that transform it into a social construct. (Breakwell, 2014)
	•	SARF requires multidimensional approaches to data collection if it is to evolve towards predicting amplification/attenuation and ripple effects. (Breakwell, 2014)
	•	The SARF provides a useful platform for the systematic analysis of the consequences of a risk event. (Breakwell, 2014)
	•	The SARF is a comprehensive approach to the analysis of the risk event. It pushes researchers towards a whole life-cycle examination of the hazard, recognising that it exists as part of hazard sequences. It makes it clear that the impacts of a risk event cannot be meaningfully said to lie at any one level of analysis. As a consequence, it is requiring the use of multi-disciplinary methodological tools. (Breakwell, 2014)
	•	The two theories presented in this chapter (SRT and IPT) would seem together to offer a meta- theoretical structure that could be used by SARF researchers. These theories are targeted precisely at the factors that should determine the nature of amplifica- tion (including intensification, attenuation, representation, de-attenuation and de-intensification) and rippling processes. Used in conjunction, IPT and SRT range across the spectrum of intra-personal, group and intergroup processes that affect the development of the representation of the hazard and its subsequent secondary impacts. These theories will generate hypotheses that are testable within the SARF. (Breakwell, 2014)
	•	the SARF demands that the relevance of theories from other levels of analysis (e.g. the economic) should be incorporated. (Breakwell, 2014)
	•	This concept is based on the hypothesis that events pertaining to hazards interact with psychological, social, institutional and cultural processes in ways that can heighten or attenuate individual and social perceptions of risk and shape risk behaviour. Behavioural patterns, in turn, generate secondary social or economic consequences that extend far beyond direct harm to human health or the environment, including significant indirect impacts such as liability, insurance costs, loss of confidence in institutions or alienation from community affairs (Burns et al, 1993). Such amplified secondary effects can then trigger demands for additional institu- tional responses and protective actions, or, conversely (in the case of risk attenuation), place impediments in the path of needed protective actions. (Renn, 2007b)

Social amplification model
	•	The social amplification model predicts that initial trigger factors will have ripple effects leading to secondary trigger factors. (Lofstedt, 2008)
	•	Models are presented that portray the elements and linkages in the proposed conceptual framework. (Kasperson et al., 1988)
	•	The model serves to analyze social relationships with risk as they are expressed around given risk objects or situations. Changes in collective behavior can be explained as resulting from the amplification or attenuation any partic- ular risk may have received. (Poumadère and Mays, 2003)
	•	Pidgeon, Henwood, and Maguire (1999, p. 70) have commented that the social amplification of risk model serves as "a useful analytical tool for describing and integrating relationships between rival theories of risk perception and communication, and for deriving new signals about the societal processing of risk signals." (Frewer, 2003)
Information system 
	•	Like a stereo receiver, the information system may amplify risk events in two ways: By intensifying or weakening signals that are part of the information that individuals and social groups receive about the risk; By filtering the multitude of signals with respect to the attributes of the risk and their importance. (Kasperson et al., 1988)
Amplification processes
	•	Amplification processes (note: they are taken by Breakwell and Barnett to encompass intensification, attenuation, representation, de-intensification and de- attenuation) will consequently involve the probably simultaneous presentation of varying messages about the risk event. (Breakwell, 2014)
Attribution of information
	•	But many risks are not experienced directly. When direct personal experience i s lacking or minimal, individuals learn about risk from other persons and from the media. Information flow becomes a key ingredient in public response and acts as a major agent of amplification. Attributes of information that may influence the social amplification are volume, the degree to which information is disputed, the extent of dramatization, and the symbolic connotations of the information. (Kasperson et al., 1988)
	•	Attributes of information about a risk that may influence the social ampli- fication include volume, degree to which information is disputed, and symbolic connotations of information (Kasperson et al. 1988, p. 18) (Poumadère and Mays, 2003)
Amplification stations
	•	Amplification stations can include individuals, social groups, and institutions, for example, scientists or scientific institutions, reporters and the mass media, politicians and government agencies, or other social groups and their members. (Kasperson et al., 2003)
	•	The notion of a ‘station’ implies that reshaping (e.g. filtering, re-emphasis, elaboration, glossing and so on) of information is involved as it moves through that node (‘station’) in the system. (Breakwell, 2014)
	•	when dealing with risk amplification and ripple effects, we are not just dealing with individual reactions to this complex panoply of sources. We are dealing with institutional and organisational responses, sometimes internationally (Breakwell, 2014)
	•	When ‘stations’ find that they are broadcasting messages about a risk event that are at variance with each other, there is scope for them to attempt to negotiate a common interpretation or, if this proves impossible, at least to seek a compatible set of interpretations. (Breakwell, 2014)31/05/2020 14:17:00
Social amplification stations
	•	Social amplification stations generate and transmit information via communications channels (media, letters, telephones, direct conversations). In addition, each recipient also engages in amplification (and attenuation) processes, thereby acting as an amplifi- cation station for risk-related information. (Kasperson et al., 1988)
	•	We hypthesize that the key amplification steps consist of the following: Filtering of signals (e.g., only a fraction of all incoming information is actually processed); Decoding of the signal; Processing of risk information (e.g., the useof cognitive heuristics for drawing inferences); Attaching social values to the information inorder to draw implications for managementand policy; Interacting with one's cultural and peergroups to interpret and validate signals; Formulating behavioral intentions to tolerate the risk or to take actions against the risk orrisk manager; Engaging in group or individual actions to accept, ignore, tolerate, or change the risk. (Kasperson et al., 1988)
	•	For social stations of amplification, the likes of institutional structure, functions, and culture influence the amplification or attenuation of risk signals. (Kasperson et al., 2003)
	•	The use of terms like ‘social stations’ in the figure occurs because the originators were using the metaphor of amplification from classical communications theory applied to physical systems. (Breakwell, 2014)
Direct experience
	•	Direct experience with risky activities or events can be either reassuring (as with automobile driving) or alarming (as with tornadoes or floods). Generally, experience with dramatic accidents or risk events increases the memorability and imaginability of the hazard, thereby heightening the perception of risk. But direct experience can also provide feedback on the nature, extent, a n d manageability of the hazard, affording better perspective and enhanced capability for avoiding risks. (Kasperson et al., 1988)
	•	[…] whereas direct personal experience can serve as a risk amplifier, it can also act to attenuate risk. Understanding this interaction for different risks, for different social experiences, and for different cultural groups is an important research need. (Kasperson et al., 1988)
Secondary impact
	•	Social amplifications of risk will spawn behavioral responses, which, in turn, will result in secondary impacts. (Kasperson et al., 1988)
	•	Secondary impacts include such effects as the following: Enduring mental perceptions, images, and attitudes (e.g., antitechnology attitudes, alienation from the physical environment, social apathy, stigmatization of an environment or risk manager);  Local impacts on business sales, residential property values, and economic activity; Political and social pressure (e.g., political demands,changes in political climate and culture); Changes in the physical nature of the risk (e.g., feedback mechanisms that enlarge or lower the risk); Changes in training, education, or required qualifications of operating and emergency-response personnel; Social disorder (e.g., protesting, rioting, sabotage, terrorism); Changes in risk monitoring and regulation; Increased liability and insurance costs; Repercussions on other technologies (e.g., lower levels of public acceptance) and on social institutions (e.g., erosion of public trust). (Kasperson et al., 1988)
	•	Secondary impacts are, in turn, perceived by social groups and individuals so that another stage of amplification may occur to produce third-order im- pacts. The impacts thereby may spread, or "ripple," to other parties, distant locations, or future generations. (Kasperson et al., 1988)
	•	secondary impacts include market impacts (perhaps through consumer avoidance of a prod- uct or related products), demands for regulatory constraints, litigation, community opposition, loss of credibility and trust, stigmatization of a product, facility, or community, and investor flight. (Kasperson et al., 2003)
	•	Secondary impacts, whether amplified or not, are of major concern to those who are obliged to take over the costs or cope with the consequences of being accountable. (Renn, 2007b)

Ripple effect
	•	The analogy of dropping a stone into a pond (see Fig. 1) serves to illustrate the spread of the higher-order impacts associated with the social amplification of risk. The ripples spread outward, first encompassing the directly affected victims or the first group to be notified, then touching the next higher institutional level (a company or an agency), and, in more extreme cases, reaching other parts of the industry or other social arenas with similar problems. (Kasperson et al., 1988)
	•	This rippling of impacts is an important element of risk amplification since it suggests that amplification can introduce substantial temporal and geographical extension of impacts (Kasperson et al., 1988)
	•	The ripples spread outward, first encompassing the directly affected victims or the first group to be notified, then touching the next higher institutional level (a company or an agency), and, in more extreme cases, reaching other parts of the industry or other social arenas with similar problems. (Kasperson et al., 2003)
	•	This rippling of impacts is an important element of risk amplification since it suggests that the pro- cesses can extend (in risk amplification) or constrain (in risk attenuation) the temporal, sectoral, and geographical scales of impacts. (Kasperson et al., 2003)
	•	The ‘ripple effects’ can spread far beyond the originating risk event. This diffusion of impact indicates that there are many potential ‘stations’ that can contribute to the amplification or attenuation process. This suggests that the risk event will have no ultimate or consolidated interpretation. It will change over time as each element in the ripple system is brought into play. (Breakwell, 2014)
	•	when dealing with risk amplification and ripple effects, we are not just dealing with individual reactions to this complex panoply of sources. We are dealing with institutional and organisational responses, sometimes internationally (Breakwell, 2014)
	•	
Dramatization
	•	Dramatization, a third attribute, is undoubtedly a powerful source of risk amplification. (Kasperson et al., 1988)

Symbolic factors
	•	Symbols include such things as the prestige, or other features, of an information source. (Poumadère and Mays, 2003)
Response mechanisms
	•	responses to the risk event actually define the risk it-self: the construction of the event, psychologically and socially shared in interaction and in collective sense making, itself shapes the danger. (Poumadère and Mays, 2003)
	•	The framework was originally developed around a typical sequence in which experts (scientists, technologists...) define risk through their assessments, a definition which then becomes attached, challenged or unchallenged, to a given risk event. This definition flows with the sig- nals amplified or attenuated dirough relay stations, moving out from the expert circle across, for example, the media, and arrivingfinallyat a non- specialist level before "rippling" out again across economic institutions and arenas. (Poumadère and Mays, 2003)

Heuristics and Values
	•	Individuals cannot deal with the full complexity of risk and the mul- titude of risks involved in daily life. Thus people use simplifying mechanisms to evaluate risk and to shape responses. These processes, while permitting individuals to cope with a risky world, may sometimes in- troduce biases that cause distortions and errors. Similarly, the application of individ- ual and group values will also determine which risks are deemed important or minor and what actions, if any, should be taken. (Kasperson et al., 1988)

Social Group Relationships
	•	Risk issues enter into the political agenda of social and political groups. The nature of these groups will influence member responses and the types of rationality brought to risk issues. To the extent that risk becomes a central issue in a political campaign or in a conflict among social groups, it will be vigorously brought to more general public attention, often coupled with ideological interpretations of technol- ogy or the risk-managementprocess. (Kasperson et al., 1988)
Stigmatization
	•	Stigma refers to the negative imagery associated with undesirable social groups or individuals. (Kasperson et al., 1988)
	•	Since the typical response to stigmatized persons or environments is avoidance, it is reasonable to assume that risk-induced stigma may have significant social and policy consequences. (Kasperson et al., 1988)
	•	Kasperson et al. (1988) hypothesised that stigmatisation was one of the four major mechanisms (the others being: the use of heuristics and value filters, changes in intergroup relationships and modification in risk signal values) whereby the amplification process can generate ripple and secondary effects. (Breakwell, 2014)
	•	stigma has been used to refer to the negative imagery associated with undesirable individuals or social groups. (Breakwell, 2014)
	•	Kasperson et al. proposed that hazards could also be stigmatised. Hazards that are stigmatised would be shunned and attacked in the same way that other stigmatised objects are treated. (Breakwell, 2014)
	•	the stigma is not necessarily just attached to the hazard itself; it can transfer to places, people, products or technologies associated with the hazard. (Breakwell, 2014)
	•	Kasperson et al. (2001) extended the social amplification framework to focus upon stigmatisation. In this version, the risk event generates a flow of communi- cation that influences risk perceptions and images, but this simultaneously ‘marks’ associated places, products and technologies. (Breakwell, 2014)
	•	The stigma is thus attached to the object and can stimulate further secondary effects – for instance, in the public acceptability of the object or in regulatory impositions upon it. (Breakwell, 2014)
Layering method
	•	This method, which they have called ‘the layering method’, entails: Collection of data that are situated at various levels of analysis. At the individual level this may include evidence of cognitions, affect and behaviour. At the societal level it might use data at both structural and processual levels. For instance, it could include evidence of shifts in political policy, the structure of groups, the relationships between groups, communication patterns, economic indicators, scientific and technological innovation or practices, and so on. Effectively, the task is to collect data which reflect what is happening to the individuals and institutions (defined broadly) that might be affected by the risk event; Data from these different levels are ‘layered’ such that it is possible to see for one moment in time the data at each of the levels that are relevant to the amplification and ripple effects of the risk event; Data from each of the levels are also collected over time, allowing multiple time-points to be compared. These comparisons can be between different times on the same level of analysis. For instance, attitudes might be tracked over time. In addition, these comparisons can be between levels of analysis over time. This entails identifying the temporal profiles in data across levels of analysis. For instance, while attitudes (e.g. health attitudes) are tracked over time, the inci- dence of a particular illness is also tracked with the same data sam- pling time-points. (Breakwell, 2014)
	•	The method generates layers of data arranged at different levels of analysis tied together by a clearly defined time frame.
(Breakwell, 2014)
	•	The layering method can be used to identify the relationships between the various components in the SARF. For instance, it can be used to look at how, following a risk event, the various ‘stations’ react and interact, the information sources and channels are used, the behaviour patterns of individuals and institutions change, and the legislative, economic, political, etc., effects appear. (Breakwell, 2014)
	•	The layering method, described here, represents one systematic approach to direct data collection that is appropriate to the SARF. (Breakwell, 2014)
Social animal
	•	From the moment we are born, we humans feel a never-ending need for attention. We are social animals to the core. Our survival and happiness depend on the bonds we form with others. If people do not pay attention to us, we cannot connect to them on any level. Some of this is purely physical—we must have people looking at us to feel alive. As those who have gone through long periods of isolation can attest, without eye contact we begin to doubt our existence and to descend into a deep depression. But this need is also deeply psychological: through the quality of attention we receive from others, we feel recognized and appreciated for who we are. Our sense of Self-worth depends on this. Because this is so important to the human animal, people will do almost anything to get attention, including committing a crime or attempting suicide. Look behind almost any action, and you will see this need as a primary motivation. (Greene, 2018)
	•	As social animals we humans are very sensitive to our rank and position within any group. We can measure our status by the attention and respect we receive. We are constantly monitoring differences and comparing ourselves with others. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Let us be realistic, however, and realize that it is almost impossible to rid ourselves of the compulsion to compare ourselves with others. It is too ingrained in our nature as a social animal. (Greene, 2018)
	•	The social force among humans is merely a more complex version of what all social animals experience. Social animals are continually attuned to the emotions of others within the group, aware of their role in the pack and anxious to fit in. (Among higher primates, this includesimitating those higher up in the rank as a show of inferiority.) They display elaborate physical cues that allow the group to communicate and cooperate. They have grooming rituals to tighten their bonds, and hunting in packs has a similar effect. They experience a shared energy when simply assembled together. (Greene, 2018)
	•	We do not like to see ourselves as social animals operating under particular compulsions. It offends our self-opinion as a species. (Greene, 2018)
	•	The problem we face as social animals is not that we experience this force, which occurs automatically, but that we are in denial of its existence. We become influenced by others without realizing it. Accustomed to unconsciously following what others say and do, we lose the ability to think for ourselves. When faced with critical decisions in life, we simply imitate what others have done or listen to people who parrot conventional wisdom. This can lead to many inappropriate decisions. We also lose contact with what makes us unique, the source of our power as individuals (see chapter 13 for more on this). (Greene, 2018)
	•	We are social creatures. (Greene, 2018)
	•	We are social animals to the core, and we need to convince ourselves that we are loyal to and cooperative with the communities we belong to. (Greene, 2018)
Social behaviour
	•	Motives of social behavior are based on individual instincts. Individual instincts, on the other hand, must yield to group needs. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
Social biology
	•	« sociologie statique » semblable à l’anatomie des organes au repos, et une « sociologie dynamique » comparable à l’embryologie et à la physiologie. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	C’est dans ce deuxième sens qu’il faut entendre la biologie sociale dont l’objectif est d’étudier les mouvements qui se produisent à l’intérieur des sociétés. (Mannoni, 1985)
Social breakdown
	•	Mesure et répétition sont les couleurs dont se pare habituellement l’univers frileux des communautés. Tout y est stable, réglé. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	La stabilité, la continuité permettent à la masse de vivre son idéal de pérennité. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	une rupture tiendrait aux deux systèmes à la fois, l’ancien auquel elle sert de clôture et le prochain dont elle est déjà le moment initial. Transitoire par nature, elle serait l’un des principaux moteurs du dynamisme social, forçant sous sa loi les cités et les empires qu’elle ébranle profondément dans leurs structures traditionnelles. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Les modèles référentiels sont remis en question et, en tout cas, perdent leur pouvoir normatif. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Pour J. Duvignaud (op. cit., p. 56), cet état critique est lié à un changement de type de société et à l’avènement de formes de vies inédites destinées à remplacer les formes traditionnelles. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Si la rupture est un changement, elle est aussi et surtout un passage qu’il est sans doute difficile de déterminer temporellement d’une façon précise. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Les systèmes de la décomposition en question apparaissent dans les violences urbaines, les faits divers aberrants, le développement considérable de la névrose, les maladies inconnues, les biographies difficiles à répertorier. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	La rupture risque, comme tout état critique, de déboucher sur un choc lié à un changement exponentiel. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Mais tandis que disparaît un type de société et que s’effacent peu à peu ses structures atteintes par la désuétude, un autre monde se prépare dans l’ombre dont la vocation est de combler le vide laissé par la disparition de l’ancien. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	anomiques qui sont les signes sociologiques d’une mutation. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	La société, ainsi que nous l’avons décrite plus haut, s’enveloppe comme d’un manteau des formes sages de la vie communautaire. Cet ordre qu’elle entretient autour d’elle est, en réalité, une véritable ligne de défense contre toute mobilité ou déformation qui porte toujours en germes, nous l’avons également dit, une menace de déchirure. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	les lignes de défense sont le lieu ou les ruptures sont possibles et probable. (Mannoni, 1985)
Social capital
	•	Social capital is the term we give to trust, and trust is different from confidence. (Coker, 2009)
Social class
	•	La classe est formée par des individus d'origines diverses réunis, non par la communauté des croyances, comme le sont les membres d'une secte, ni par la communauté des occupations professionnelles, comme le sont les membres d'une caste, mais par certains intérêts, certaines habitudes de vie et d'éducation fort semblables. Telles sont, par exemple, la classe bourgeoise, la classe agricole, etc. (Lebon, 1895)
Social code
	•	Most of the time we secretly suffer from the endless social codes we have to adhere to. We have to seem so nice and agreeable, always going along with the group. We better not show too much confidence or ambition. Seem humble and similar to everyone else; that’s how the game is played. In following this path we gain comfort by fitting in, but we also become defensive and secretly resentful. Being so nice becomes a habit, which easily turns into timidity, lack of confidence, and indecision. At the same time, our Shadow will show itself, but unconsciously, in explosive fits and starts, and often to our detriment. (Greene, 2018)
Social cohesion
	•	Montesquieu montre bien que, lorsque l’intérêt particulier se joue de l’intérêt général et qu’il n’y a plus d’esprit civique, il n’y a par suite plus de société possible : on n’a plus affaire qu’à un ramassis d’individus livrés à la loi hobbienne du plus fort sur fond d’anarchie. (Mannoni, 1985)
Social contract
	•	the state provided social security at home in return for the citizen’s willingness to be conscripted. (Coker, 2009)
	•	The Bismarckian social contract was popular precisely because moder- nity made people particularly insecure. (Coker, 2009)
	•	Le contrat social est donc, bel et bien, un contrat de solidarité bien que l’on sache plus ou moins implicitement qu’il ne peut vraiment s’appliquer que dans une république idéale peuplée de citoyens hautement vertueux. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	comme les hommes ne sont pas des anges, il est nécessaire qu’une fonction de contrôle soit surajoutée au contrat pour interdire les déviations et les entorses à la règle communautaire. (Mannoni, 1985)

	•	la notion, plus psychosociologique, de contrôle social. (Mannoni, 1985)
Social control
	•	le contrôle social comme l’ensemble des forces qui poursuivent le double but de favoriser l’agrégation de tous les membres de la collectivité pour les souder en un tout homogène, d’une part, et comme l’ensemble des facteurs de contention et de répression ayant pour mission de veiller à ce que le système ne permette pas — ou permette le moins possible — de fuites, d’autre part. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Le contrat social est donc, bel et bien, un contrat de solidarité bien que l’on sache plus ou moins implicitement qu’il ne peut vraiment s’appliquer que dans une république idéale peuplée de citoyens hautement vertueux. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	comme les hommes ne sont pas des anges, il est nécessaire qu’une fonction de contrôle soit surajoutée au contrat pour interdire les déviations et les entorses à la règle communautaire. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Il faut donc s’attendre, à partir de là, à une certaine intolérance de la part du groupe. Surtout si l’on accepte l’idée que le groupe recherche toujours, à travers l’idéologie religieuse ou politique qu’il se fixe, une certaine image de lui-même où il puisse s’appréhender et se livrer aux délices du narcissisme. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	à travers les postulations d’idéaux divers une entité est perpétuellement en quête d’elle-même. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	la réalité apporte souvent des déceptions inévitables puisque la nature profonde de ces programmes est selon l’imaginaire. (Mannoni, 1985)

	•	« le besoin d’approbation sociale, la crainte de la sanction agiraient en fond motivationnel » et expliqueraient également le conformisme. En effet, c’est peut-être bien, en fin de compte, en termes d’affectivité qu’il convient de poser ce problème. (Mannoni, 1985)
Social cost
	•	Social costs represent what society as a whole has to pay because of legislative change. They typically include negative externalities and exclude transfer costs among groups of citizens (or companies). (Torriti and Ikpeb, 2014)
Social ecology
	•	See people as facts of nature. They come in all varieties, like flowers or rocks. There are fools and saints and sociopaths and egomaniacs and noble warriors; there are the sensitive and the insensitive. They all play a role in our social ecology. (Greene, 2018)
Social force
	•	we find ourselves working in a group with a critical goal to reach within a short time frame. We feel compelled to do more than we normally can, to work extra hard. We feel a charge of energy that comes from feeling connected to others who are working with the same urgent spirit. A point is reached at which members of the group do not even have to talk—we’re all on the same page and can even anticipate the thoughts of our colleagues.The above feelings are not registered rationally; they come to us in automatic bodily sensations—goose bumps, racing heartbeat, extra vitality and power. Let us call us this energy the social force, a type of invisible force field that affects and binds a group of people through shared sensations and creates an intense feeling of connection. (Greene, 2018)
	•	We can observe several interesting elements to the social force: First, it exists inside us and outside us at the same time. When we experience the bodily sensations mentioned above, we are almost certain that others on our side are feeling the same. We feel the force within, but we think of it as outside ourselves as well. This is an unusual sensation, perhaps equivalent to what we feel when we are in love and experience a shared energy that passes between ourselves and the love object.We can also say this force differs, depending on the size and chemistry of the particular group. In general, the larger the group, the more intense is the effect. When we are among a very large group of people who seem to share our ideas or values, we feel quite a rush of increased strength and vitality, as well as a communal warmth or heat that comes from feeling that we belong. There is something awesome and sublime about this force multiplied in a large crowd. This increase in energy and excitement can easily shift to anger and violence in the presence of an enemy. The particular mix of people shapes the effect as well. If the leader is charismatic and bursting with energy, it filters through the group or gathered masses. If a large number of individuals have a particular emotional tendency toward anger or joy, that will alter the collective mood. (Greene, 2018)
	•	we are drawn to this force. We feel attracted to numbers—a stadium full of partisan supporters of a team, choirs ofpeople singing, parades, carnivals, concerts, religious assemblies, and political conventions. In these situations, we are reliving what our ancestors invented and refined—the gathering of the clan, massed soldiers parading in columns before the city walls, early theatrical and gladiatorial spectacles. Subtracting the minority who feel frightened by such gatherings, we generally have a love of partisan crowds for their own sake. They make us feel alive and vital. This can become an addiction—we feel compelled to expose ourselves to this energy again and again. Music and dance epitomize this aspect of the social force. The group experiences the rhythm and melody as one, and music and dance are among the earliest forms we created to satisfy this urge, to externalize the force. (Greene, 2018)
	•	We can observe one other aspect to the social force, in its reverse form: when we experience a prolonged period of isolation. We know from the accounts of prisoners in solitary confinement and explorers isolated in remote regions (see Richard E. Byrd’s account of his harrowing five months in isolation in Antarctica, in his book Alone) that they begin to feel disconnected from reality and sense that their personalities are disintegrating. They become prone to elaborate hallucinations. What they miss most of all is not simply the presence of people near them but the eyes of others looking back at them. We formed our whole concept of ourselves in our first months as we looked at our mothers; her return gaze gave us a sense that we existed; she told us who we were by how she looked at us. As adults, we experience the same kind of nonverbal validation and sense of self through the eyes of others who look at us. We are never aware of this; it would take prolonged isolation to understand the phenomenon. (Greene, 2018)
	•	The social force can make itself felt in our virtual worlds and virtual crowds. It is less intense than being in an actual crowd, but we can feel the presence of others in a phantom-like way through the screen (inside us and outside us), and we continually consult our smartphones as a kind of substitute pair of eyes upon us. (Greene, 2018)
	•	The social force among humans is merely a more complex version of what all social animals experience. Social animals are continually attuned to the emotions of others within the group, aware of their role in the pack and anxious to fit in. (Among higher primates, this includesimitating those higher up in the rank as a show of inferiority.) They display elaborate physical cues that allow the group to communicate and cooperate. They have grooming rituals to tighten their bonds, and hunting in packs has a similar effect. They experience a shared energy when simply assembled together. (Greene, 2018)
	•	We humans may seem much more sophisticated, but the same dynamic occurs in us as well, on a completely subverbal level. We sense and feel what others in the group are feeling. We have an urgent need to fit in and play our role in the group. We are prone to unconsciously imitate gestures and expressions, particularly from leaders. We still like to hunt in packs, through social media or wherever it is acceptable to vent our anger. We have our own rituals to tighten group bonds—religious or political assemblies, spectacles, warfare. And we most definitely experience a collective energy that passes through any group of like-minded people. (Greene, 2018)
	•	The social force is neither positive nor negative. It is simply a physiological part of our nature. Many aspects of this force that evolved so long ago are quite dangerous in the modern world. For instance, the deep suspicion we tend to feel toward outsiders to our group, and our need to demonize them, evolved among our earliest ancestors because of the tremendous dangers of infectious diseases and the aggressive intentions of rival hunter-gatherers. But such group reactions are no longer relevant in the twenty-first century. In fact, with our technological prowess, they can be the source of our most violent and genocidal behavior. (Greene, 2018)
	•	In general, to the degree that the socialforce tends to degrade our ability to think independently and rationally, we can say it exerts a downward pull into more primitive ways of behaving, unsuited to modern conditions. (Greene, 2018)
	•	The social force, however, can be used and shaped for positive purposes, for high-level cooperation and empathy, for an upward pull, which we experience when we create something together in a group. (Greene, 2018)
	•	The problem we face as social animals is not that we experience this force, which occurs automatically, but that we are in denial of its existence. We become influenced by others without realizing it. Accustomed to unconsciously following what others say and do, we lose the ability to think for ourselves. When faced with critical decisions in life, we simply imitate what others have done or listen to people who parrot conventional wisdom. This can lead to many inappropriate decisions. We also lose contact with what makes us unique, the source of our power as individuals (see chapter 13 for more on this). (Greene, 2018)
	•	What we need more than anything is group intelligence. This intelligence includes a thorough understanding of the effect that groups have on our thinking and emotions; with such awareness, we can resist the downward pull. It also includes understanding how human groups operate according to certain laws and dynamics, which can make it easier to navigate through such spaces. With such intelligence, we can do a delicate dance—we can become gifted social actors and outwardly fit in, while inwardly maintaining some distance and some mental space to think for ourselves. With this degree of independence, we can make decisions in life that are appropriate to who we are and our circumstances. (Greene, 2018)
Social game
	•	Similar phenomena appear also in more complicated social ‘games’, where an individual’s outcome can be strongly influenced by his or her position in a network of relations. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
	•	Les rôles font les hommes plus encore que les hommes ne font les rôles : ainsi le veut le jeu social. (Mannoni, 1985)
Social identification
	•	la pression à la conformité peut être éclairée encore par le mécanisme de l’identification. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Relevons encore le phénomène de mimétisme auquel se réfèrent les biologistes du comportement (éthologues) suivant lesquels de nombreuses espèces animales ont des formes copiant les éléments du milieu. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Les efforts d’assimilation que font, par exemple, l’étranger ou l’immigrant vis-à-vis de leur culture d’accueil est tout à fait significatif : en adoptant les tournures linguistiques et les coutumes de ses hôtes, celui-ci se défend contre sa crainte d’être rejeté. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Le groupe tend donc à s’organiser spontanément dans le sens de l’accord des esprits et des attitudes. (Mannoni, 1985)

Social Intelligence
	•	Social intelligence is the ability to see people in the most realistic light possible. By moving past our usual self-absorption, we can learn to focus deeply on others, reading their behavior in the moment, seeing what motivates them, and discerning any possible manipulative tendencies. (Greene, 2014)
	•	Social intelligence is nothing more than the process of discarding the Naïve Perspective and approaching something more realistic. It involves focusing our attention outward instead of inward, honing the observational and empathic skills that we naturally possess. It means moving past our tendency to idealize and demonize people, and seeing and accepting them as they are. (Greene, 2014)
	•	This intelligence consists of two components, both equally important to master. First, there is what we shall call specific knowledge of human nature— namely the ability to read people, to get a feel for how they see the world, and to understand their individuality. Second, there is the general knowledge of human nature, which means accumulating an understanding of the overall patterns of human behavior that transcend us as individuals, including some of the darker qualities we often disregard. Only the possession of both forms of knowledge can give you a complete picture of the people around you. (Greene, 2014)
	•	Your work is the single greatest means at your disposal for expressing your social intelligence. By being efficient and detail oriented in what you do, you demonstrate that you are thinking of the group at large and advancing its cause. By making what you write or present clear and easy to follow, you show your care for the audience or public at large. By involving other people in your projects and gracefully accepting their feedback, you reveal your comfort with the group dynamic. (Greene, 2014)
	•	You must see the creation of a persona as a key element in social intelligence, not something evil or demonic. (Greene, 2014)
Social life
	•	Au même titre que la vie individuelle, la vie des groupes est marquée par l’alternance. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	ponctuée de temps à autre par un événement saillant. Celui-ci peut avoir un caractère purement occasionnel ou accidentel (guerre, séisme, épidémie) ou se présenter, au contraire, sous les aspects d’un phénomène récurrent.
	•	Son retour est alors prévisible, inscrit dans une certaine régularité, voire au calendrier (fêtes, rites, commémorations). (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	La vie quotidienne apparaît ainsi fondamentalement constituée de temps faibles quantitativement les plus nombreux et de temps forts qui introduisent une alternative à la monotonie. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Nous croyons pouvoir affirmer que cette alternance et cette récurrence sont saines et restauratrices de l’organisation sociale : les fonctions de représentation et d’imagination sont activées et le désir de nouveauté partiellement satisfait, au moins au niveau symbolique. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Par conséquent, tout ce qui est susceptible de modifier cette platitude est accueilli avec intérêt, même lorsqu’il s’agit d’expériences éprouvantes ou bouleversantes :
	•	Or, parler de rythme et d’alternance revient à introduire, dans la compréhension de la vie sociale, l’idée d’une discontinuité. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Le flux quotidien connaîtrait de la sorte diverses « phases » ou « moments » suivant la proximité ou l’éloignement d’un temps fort. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Le monotone, le banal seraient contrastés par des expériences émotionnellement riches, parfois même tumultueuses, qui apportent l’indispensable renouvellement de l’horizon affectivo-intellectuel et modifient la vitesse de déroulement des faits journaliers. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	les exigences de la réalité sont là qui relâchent, de temps en temps, la pression des obligations, des interdits et surtout met un terme à leur affligeante répétition. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	La vie collective reposerait de la sorte sur le jeu alternatif de tout ce qui, dans l’histoire de la société, va dans le sens de la congruence, d’une plus grande homogénéité toujours à parfaire ou à refaire, et de ce qui, a contrario, s’efforce de dénouer ce qui est établi pour promouvoir la nouveauté sous toutes ses formes. (Mannoni, 1985)

	•	On comprend alors que se mette en place, au sein de la société, tout un ensemble de procédures dont le but est d’atteindre une toujours problématique cohérence-congruence de ce qui, dans le corps social, semble caractérisé par la fluctuation et la tendance au changement. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	La démarche s’effectue par tâtonnements multiples et nécessite des ajustements qui ne sont jamais définitifs. Les institutions les plus stables en apparence sont elles aussi sujettes aux modifications et parfois au bouleversement. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	C’est ainsi que l’on peut désigner les efforts de cohérence que fait le groupe. (Mannoni, 1985)
Social location
	•	[…] social location have always provided the materials for self-serving constructions of epidemiological risk. The poor, the alien, the sinner have all served as convenient objects for such stigmatizing speculations (Rosenberg, 1988 in Douglas, 2005:36)
Social order
	•	In human societies, social order arises from the combination of autonomous individuals, often with conflicting interests, that still end up performing tasks that nobody could do on their own.  (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
Social paranoia
	•	Le fanatisme est donc près du délire ; on pourrait aussi l’appeler paranoia sociale. (Mannoni, 1985)
Social phenomenom
	•	L'étude des phénomènes sociaux ne peut être séparée de celle des peuples chez lesquels ils se sont produits. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	en étudiant un phénomène social, le considérer successivement sous deux aspects très différents. On voit alors que les enseignements de la raison pure sont bien souvent contraires à ceux de la raison pratique. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Il y a des phénomènes sociaux qu'il faut étudier en psychologue beaucoup plus qu'en naturaliste. (Lebon, 1895)

Social physics
	•	Social physics had introduced a series of decentrings into the way one considered eople, things and their relationships; it proposed a mode of thinking completely foreign to the moral, moralizing mode whichunderpinned and was supposed to validate the juridical notion and practice of responsibility, and yet it did this without entering into conflict with juridical practice. (Foucault et al., 1991)
Social position
	•	As the most complex social animal on the planet, we humans form elaborate hierarchies based on position, money, and power. We are aware of these hierarchies, but we do not like talking explicitly about relative power positions, and we are generally uncomfortable when others talk about their superior rank. Instead, signs of dominance or weakness are more often expressed in nonverbal communication. We have inherited this communication style from other primates, notably chimpanzees, who have elaborate signals to denote an individual chimp’s place in the social rank. Keep in mind that the feeling of being in a superior social position gives people a confidence that will radiate outward in their body language. Some feel this confidence before they attain a position of power, and it becomes a Self-fulfilling prophecy as others are drawn to them. Some who are ambitious might try to simulate these cues, but it has to be done well. Fake confidence can be quite off-putting. (Greene, 2018)
Social pre-commitment to rational acceptability thresholds (SPRAT)
	•	For SPRAT, the emphasis is laid more on rational decision methods than on other dimensions of institutional design. The underlying design problem is for “society”, guided by the best available scientific consensus, to somehow settle on the appropriate settings for the risk engineers to programme into the “thermostat” (Hood and Jones, 1996)
	•	SPRAT approach is to make a definitive scientific-bureaucratic decision about what is or is not safe food through ever more refined toxicological conventions (Hood and Jones, 1996)
	•	SPRAT requires a stable consensus over risk settings (Hood and Jones, 1996)
Social power
	•	Maintenant, il fallait retourner dans la vie, parmi les hommes, et prendre dans la société le rang, l'influence et le pouvoir que donne en ce monde la richesse, la première et la plus grande des forces dont peut disposer la créature humaine. (Dumas, 1998)
Social psychology
	•	Longtemps maintenus dans l’éclairage théorique et normatif de certaines philosophies, les comportements des hommes relativement à leur habitat, à leurs mœurs, à leurs rites associatifs, tout ce qui constituait leur vie de groupe, s’est trouvé enfin appréhendé d’une manière plus objective. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	on sait qu’en science on doit se mettre à l’école des phénomènes. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	L’antinomie entre l’individu et le groupe n’est qu’apparente et pour tout dire fausse, et une psychologie digne de ce nom ne saurait prononcer d’exclusive au privilège de l’un ou de l’autre. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	avec le phénomène collectif apparaît une certaine « nouveauté » dans le comportement de l’individu. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Les manuels de psychologie sociale abordent, en général, les processus de socialisation de l’homme, c’est-à-dire des rapports de l’individu avec d’autres individus ou avec une société. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	la psychologie sociale naît au point de convergence de sciences autonomes comme la psychologie générale, la sociologie, l’ethnologie, l’ethnopsychiatrie, la criminologie et même la biologie et l’éthologie, et de théories comme le behaviorisme, le culturalisme, la psychanalyse, le gestaltisme. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Quant aux techniques et méthodes, leur diversité saute également aux yeux : tests psychométriques, questionnaires, interviews, enquêtes sur le terrain ou prospection documentaliste, expérimentation en laboratoire avec élaboration artificielle de protocoles ou analyse des données événementielles considérées comme « expériences naturelles », instruments mathématiques et plus précisément statistiques, observation directe armée des techniques audio-visuelles du recueil des données. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	La psychologie sociale (aurait) pour objet la relation qui lie un Ego (individu ou groupe) et un Alter (individu ou groupe), dans leurs rapports à un environnement social ou non social, réel ou symbolique. »  (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	« On doit reconnaître avec J. Stoetzel (op. cit., p. 259) qu’avec la « psychologie des foules » l’étude psychologique des phénomènes collectifs s’était mal engagée. » Les idées floues, souvent basées sur des préjugés, qu’émirent alors les auteurs du XIXe siècle ont entraîné un discrédit durable. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	la psychologie collective a eu la pertinence et le courage d’envisager la première un des plus graves problèmes de tous les temps : le pouvoir exercé sur des sociétés entières par des chefs, messies ou dictateurs qui tantôt les fascinaient, tantôt les terrorisaient. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	une observation du sens commun révèle que l’individu agit rarement en présence des autres comme lorsqu’il est seul, a fortiori lorsque, placé au sein d’un fort groupe, il subit directement une influence capable d’induire ou de modifier profondément son comportement. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	ce n’est pas parce qu’il y a du social qu’il y a du collectif, mais bien parce qu’il y a du collectif (politique, historique, culturel) qu’il y a du social. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	la psychologie collective comme la discipline ayant pour but d’appréhender tous les phénomènes psychologiques à caractère collectif, qu’ils soient cohérents ou déstructurants, impliquant tous les mécanismes conscients et inconscients qui composent la vie des sociétés, que ces mécanismes concernent des masses stables ou des foules passagèrement liées ainsi que les rapports de ces ensembles humains avec leurs meneurs. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	la psychologie sociale ne peut progresser que dans la mesure où elle coopère avec d’autres disciplines, comme la psychologie, la sociologie, la médecine et même la biologie. Ainsi apparaît la vocation anthropologique qui la sous-tend. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Sous réserve d’assimiler la psychologie collective à la psychologie des foules, c’est l’œuvre de G. Le Bon, sans doute, qui eut, en la matière, le plus d’influence, encore qu’elle soit loin d’être une création ex nihilo. Les deux articles parus dans la Revue scientifique en 1895 ne lui garantirent pas, en effet, la primauté, et Scipio Sighele se plaignit (1901) que Le Bon lui avait dérobé ses idées, relatives notamment à l’inhibition collective du contrôle rationnel et à l’exaltation de l’affectivité des foules, idées effectivement déjà exposées dans La folla delinquente, en 1891, par le jeune disciple de Lombroso et Ferri. Et il faut se souvenir que c’est en 1890 que G. Tarde publie sa Philosophie pénale où il évoque notamment le problème de la suggestion de la foule, cher à Le Bon, parlant de l’imitation sociale comme d’une espèce de somnambulisme. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	la question de la priorité est finalement secondaire. Notons, par contre, qu’à peu près à la même époque un bon nombre de chercheurs s’intéressèrent aux phénomènes de foules presque simultanément. En Italie, Enrico Ferri oriente les travaux de Sighele sur la recherche des phénomènes de groupe, aux Etats-Unis, Boris Sidis (1895) effectue une analyse de la psychologie de la populace (mob) tout à fait conforme à l’optique de Le Bon, et en Angleterre McDougall publie The Group Mind dans lequel il souligne le fait que les individus, absorbés par la foule à laquelle ils s’abandonnent voluptueusement par effet de « la réaction sympathique primitive », connaissent une exaltation et une intensification de leur émotivité liées à la masse psychologique qu’ils forment et à leur capacité de s’influencer mutuellement. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Néanmoins, et aussi critiquées qu’elles l’aient été, les idées de Le Bon ont servi de base à de nombreux travaux. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Celui-ci, en bon disciple de Comte, conçut le projet de faire de la sociologie une science comme les autres, au même titre que les sciences de la nature : elle aura comme elles une méthode objective et un objet défini, les faits sociaux. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	la vie psychologique ne serait ainsi que le produit de la vie sociale, les catégories de l’entendement, comme les principes de causalité, les notions d’espace et de temps. (Mannoni, 1985)

Une fois atteint le niveau émotionnel souhaité, on s’emploie à ne pas le laisser trop vite retomber. (Mannoni, 1985)

(Lebon, 1895)

	•	Il y a un siècle à peine, la politique traditionnelle des États et les rivalités des princes étaient les principaux facteurs des événements. L'opinion des foules ne comptait guère, et même, le plus souvent, ne comptait pas. (Lebon, 1895)

	•	La naissance progressive de la puissance des foules s'est faite d'abord par la propagation de certaines idées qui se sont lentement implantées dans les esprits, puis par l'association graduelle des individus, pour amener la réalisation des conceptions théoriques. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	C'est par l'association que les foules ont fini par se former des idées, sinon très justes, au moins très arrêtées de leurs intérêts et par avoir conscience de leur force. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	les revendications des foules deviennent de plus en plus nettes, et ne vont pas à moins qu'à détruire de fond en comble la société actuelle, pour la ramener à ce communisme primitif qui fut l'état normal de tous les groupes humains avant l'aurore de la civilisation. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Peu aptes au raisonnement, les foules sont au contraire très aptes à l'action. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	l'avènement des foules marque une des dernières étapes des civilisations de l'Occident, un retour complet vers ces périodes d'anarchie confuse qui semblent devoir toujours précéder l'éclosion de chaque société nouvelle. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	les maîtres du monde, tous les fondateurs de religions ou d'empires, les apôtres de toutes les croyances, les hommes d'État éminents, et, dans une sphère plus modeste, les simples chefs de petites collectivités humaines, ont toujours été des psychologues inconscients. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	La connaissance de la psychologie des foules est aujourd'hui la dernière ressource de l'homme d'État qui veut, non pas les gouverner—la chose est devenue bien difficile,—mais tout au moins ne pas être trop gouverné par elles. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Ce n'est qu'en approfondissant un peu la psychologie des foules qu'on comprend à quel point les lois et les institutions ont peu d'action sur elles; combien elles sont incapables d'avoir des opinions quelconques en dehors de celles qui leur sont imposées; que ce n'est pas avec des règles basées sur l'équité théorique pure qu'on les conduit, mais en recherchant ce qui peut les impressionner et les séduire.

	•	Au point de vue psychologique, l'expression foule prend une signification tout autre. Dans certaines circonstances données, et seulement dans ces circonstances, une agglomération d'hommes possède des caractères nouveaux fort différents de ceux des individus composant cette agglomération. La personnalité consciente s'évanouit, les sentiments et les idées de toutes les unités sont orientés dans une même direction. Il se forme une âme collective, transitoire sans doute, mais présentant des caractères très nets. La collectivité est alors devenue ce que, faute d'une expression meilleure, j'appellerai une foule organisée, ou, si l'on préfère, une foule psychologique. Elle forme un seul être et se trouve soumise à la loi de l'unité mentale des foules. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Il y a des phénomènes sociaux qu'il faut étudier en psychologue beaucoup plus qu'en naturaliste. (Lebon, 1895)
Social representation
	•	According to Moscovici, social representation operates with two prime processes: objectification; anchoring. (Breakwell, 2014)
	•	Breakwell (2001a) suggests that the novel, normally abstract, scientific specification of the hazard typically requires such objectification and anchoring. (Breakwell, 2014)

	•	The processes of objectification and anchoring could account for the structure, often evident, in representations or mental models of hazards held by lay members of the public. (Breakwell, 2014)
	•	Frequently, systematic empirical investigations expose lay repre-sentations of a novel hazard that are characterised by objectification (the abstract properties of the hazard being translated into commonly understood metaphors or represented through tangible, if tangential, exemplars) and by anchoring (being given meaning through association or through claiming similarity with other types of explanation that are more familiar). (Breakwell, 2014)
	•	There is overwhelming evidence that risk in general is fertile ground for contested social representation, and competing mental models of hazards are common. (Breakwell, 2014) 
	•	epresentations have cognitive, normative and affective components which can be in tension and this may mean that behaviour is not predictable on the basis of the social representation that is presented by an individual. (Breakwell, 2014)
	•	The individual’s relationship to any social representation can be described along a number of dimensions. (Breakwell, 2014)
	•	the social representation and identity process approach provides a framework within which such resistances to change in the mental model of the hazard can be analysed. It particularly points to the need to pay attention to the subcultural advantages of the existing mental model of the hazard when devising any intervention. (Breakwell, 2014)
	•	The two theories presented in this chapter (SRT and IPT) would seem together to offer a meta- theoretical structure that could be used by SARF researchers. These theories are targeted precisely at the factors that should determine the nature of amplifica- tion (including intensification, attenuation, representation, de-attenuation and de-intensification) and rippling processes. Used in conjunction, IPT and SRT range across the spectrum of intra-personal, group and intergroup processes that affect the development of the representation of the hazard and its subsequent secondary impacts. These theories will generate hypotheses that are testable within the SARF. (Breakwell, 2014)
	•	les représentations sociales se constituent comme des modes de pensée collectifs et participent d’une façon très active à l’élaboration sociale de l’univers mental dans lequel un groupe évolue. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	apparaissent ainsi comme des phénomènes qui, articulés avec « les systèmes de croyances et de représentations idéologiques » (J.-P. Deconchy, 1984), se situent à l’interface du psychologique et du social, de l’individuel et du collectif. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Une épistémologie du sens commun ne peut sous-estimer, aujourd’hui, l’importance que les représentations sociales ont d’un point de vue cognitif. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	une forme de connaissance socialement élaborée et partagée, ayant une visée pratique et concourant à la construction d’une réalité commune à un ensemble social ». (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Il convient cependant de bien réaliser que les représentations sociales constituent un savoir vulgaire, naïf, aboutissant à des reconstructions de l’objet, tantôt approximatives et tantôt franchement erronées, marquées par des distorsions, réductions, ajouts abusifs. L’imaginaire y joue, comme on s’en doute, un rôle très important. (Mannoni, 1985)
Objectification
	•	Objectification entails translating something that is abstract into something which is almost concrete, gaining a density of meaning which ultimately makes it a common and ‘natural’ part of thinking about the object. (Breakwell, 2014)
Anchoring
	•	Anchoring entails cate- gorising a new object into pre-existing cognitive frameworks in order to render them familiar – reducing the strange and unfamiliar object to the level of an ordinary object set in a familiar context. (Breakwell, 2014)

Hegemonic representations 
	•	these are shared by all members of a highly structured group without them having been produced by the group; they are uniform and coercive. (Breakwell, 2014)
	•	where the representation is hegemonic, the intervention must take account of the fact that the representation is not a product of the subculture but is substantially shared by everyone in it. (Breakwell, 2014)

Emancipated representations 
	•	these are the outgrowth of the circu- lation of knowledge and ideas belonging to sub-groups that are in more or less close contact – each sub-group creates and shares its own version. These representations are freed in the sense that the sub-group is at liberty to elaborate and shape them based on the access that they have to sources of information. (Breakwell, 2014) 

	•	Where the representation is emancipated, the intervention must provide a basis for changing it that emphasises the self-interest of the target subculture that has developed it and should encourage the regular communication within that sub- culture to rehearse and re-emphasise the changes required. (Breakwell, 2014) 

	•	The emancipated representation supposes individual variation based upon differential exposure within group contexts. (Breakwell, 2014) 

Polemical representations 
	•	these are generated in the course of social conflict or controversy, and society as a whole does not share them; they are determined by antagonistic relations between its members and are intended to be mutually exclusive. (Breakwell, 2014) 
	•	Where the representa- tion is polemical, the intervention must show how changing it would serve the target subculture’s interests in the context of subcultural conflict. In all cases, these interventions would require more than a simple information-deficit correction approach targeted at the individual. (Breakwell, 2014)
	•	The polemical representation supposes individual variation based upon the prevailing conditions of intergroup conflict. (Breakwell, 2014)
Awareness 
	•	individuals will differ in their awareness of the social representation; some individuals will simply not know that there is a social representation in existence, others will know only part of its scope, and yet others will be fully aware of its structure and content. (Breakwell, 2014)
	•	But awareness will also be deter- mined by the significance of the object of the representation. If the target changes in significance due to some change of social or physical circumstances, awareness of existing social representations will alter. (Breakwell, 2014)

Understanding 
	•	individuals will differ in the extent to which they actually understand the social representations of which they are aware. There is ample evidence that individuals are capable of reproducing a dominant social representation even though they cannot explain how or why its elements fit together and, if challenged, they cannot justify it. (Breakwell, 2014)

Acceptance 
	•	individuals will differ in the extent to which they believe or accept a social representation even if they are fully aware of it.
(Breakwell, 2014)
	•	The extent to which the personal representation echoes the social representation reflects in part the degree to which the latter is accepted. (Breakwell, 2014)
	•	The importance of being able to personalise the social representation so that it appears individualised should not be ignored. (Breakwell, 2014)
	•	While seeking identification and community membership at one level, people also simultaneously seek distinctiveness and differentiation. (Breakwell, 2014)
Assimilation 
	•	the individual does not accept (to whatever extent it is accepted) the social representation in some clinically detached way. It will be assimilated to pre-existent systems of personal representation (developed originally within the operation of idiosyncratic cognitive biases and capacities). This substratum of already extant personal representations will differ across individuals and the ultimate shape of the new personal representation will be influenced by it differ- entially for each individual. Just as social processes ensure that the new social representation is anchored in prior social representations, at the individual level cognitive and emotional processes ensure that it is anchored in prior personal representations. In fact, there must be an intimate connection between the social processes of anchoring and objectification and their parallel individual processes. The social communication which ensures that novel events and ideas are inter- preted in terms of existing systems of meaning is generated by indi- viduals using prior knowledge mediated through cognitive and conative networks. The social exchange can produce understandings which no single participant to the interaction might be able to create, but at some level even these emergent representations are limited in some ways by the capacities of the individuals involved to anchor andobjectify. (Breakwell, 2014)

Salience 
	•	the salience of a social representation will differ acrosspeople and for the same person across time and contexts. The salience of the social representation, for instance, may increase if the group or community which generates it is important to the individual. Similarly, it may increase if the social representation becomes relevant to the individual’s ongoing activity. At the level of the community, if the target for social representation is non-salient, it is likely that the social representation will be difficult to elicit, simple, undifferentiated and relatively unconnected with other components of the community’s belief system. (Breakwell, 2014)

Personal representation
	•	It is notable that some of the dimensions which shape the personal representation are potentially non-volitional (for example, awareness and understanding); others are volitional (for example, acceptance). (Breakwell, 2014)
	•	The nature of, and scope for, individual impact upon the social representational process depends in some ways upon the type of social representation concerned and upon the structure of the social representation itself. (Breakwell, 2014)
	•	It will vary across hegemonic, emancipated and polemical types of representation because they reflect different power relationships within and between groups or subcultures. The hegemonic representation supposes little individual variation. (Breakwell, 2014)

Social representation theory
	•	Social Representations Theory (SRT) (Moscovici, 1988; Moscovici and Farr, 1984; Howarth, 2006), one of the major social psychological theories of social influence processes (Elcheroth et al., 2011), can provide the basis for explaining how an individual may acquire a representation (or mental model) of a hazard (Breakwell, 2014b). (Breakwell, 2014)
	•	In this theory, social representations can be both products and processes. As a product, a social representation is defined as a widely shared set of beliefs, a systematic framework for explaining events and evaluating them. As a process, social representation is the whole package of activity (communication, exchange and argumentation) in which individuals and groups engage to make meaningful changes in their physical and social environment. (Breakwell, 2014)
	•	The theory of social representations may be particularly relevant to explaining why particular images or mental models of hazards evolve, because it was initially developed to explain what happens when people are faced with having to make sense of, or give meaning to, ideas or data which are novel to them, under conditions of uncertainty and where claims are contested. (Breakwell, 2014)
	•	SRT would suggest that the representation that is constructed of any hazard will be determined by the proclivities of the individual for particular forms of objectification and anchoring. (Breakwell, 2014)
	•	[…] SRT would emphasise that the representation (or mental model) produced of any hazard is not idiosyncratic or purely individualised. SRT states that objectification and anchoring are not individual processes. They are processes that normally involve social interaction and the establishment of shared meaning and consensus through communication among people. (Breakwell, 2014)
	•	Abric (1994) has argued that social representations comprise a central core (an indispensable combination of basic underlying components linked in a specific constellation and tied systematically to a set of values and norms associated with the group espousing the social representation) and the peripheric elements (the way the representation is articulated in concrete terms depending upon context). Abric argues that the core is resistant to change but that the peripheric elements are responsive to changing context. By adapting, the peripheric elements can protect the core from having to change. Following Abric might lead one to conclude that individuals will be different from each other in the personal representations they construct, not in the core, but in the peripheric elements. SRT suggests that subcultures (and social categories and groups) shape the social representations that they develop to serve their self-interests. Thus the construction of a mental model of a hazard by a subculture will be purposeful, motivated to achieve particular objectives. (Breakwell, 2014) 
	•	This SRT interpretation of the genesis of the representation of hazards has significant implications for explanations of how intensification or attenuation might work. It suggests that the subcultural base for any individual’s representa- tion of a hazard will influence their susceptibility to any reframing attempts, including official interventions aimed at changing risk perceptions. (Breakwell, 2014)
Social relations
	•	defined as 'patterns of inteerpersonal relations' (Boholm, 1996)
	•	Psychologists study social relations by describing the behaviour of each social actor in his or her circle. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
Social scientific
	•	To be social scientific means to pursue usable truth in the form of explanation of phenomena that generally is true, though some exceptions usually are admitted and condoned. (Gray, 2014)
Social role
	•	Becoming acutely aware of your own nonverbal behavior will make you more sensitive and alert to the signals of others. You will be better able to imagine the emotions that go with the cue. And you will also gain greater control of your nonverbal behavior, something very valuable for playing the right social role. (Greene, 2018)
Social scientific skills
	•	Social scientific skills are highly relevant to processes of understanding and embedding the knowledge of diverse groups in the policy process. (Stilgoe et al., 2006)
Social science
	•	Social science is very much in the business of trying to produce usable prediction-quality theory. (Gray, 2014)
	•	social sciences have widely deployed the concept of network to represent social structure. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
Social scientists
	•	Social scientists are increasingly working within and around government on issues of science and policy. They can help experts and policy-makers listen to different voices and see things differently. They can also play an active challenge function, questioning how policy issues get defined and framed. (Stilgoe et al., 2006)
Social skill
	•	The ability to observe people’s character—as seen in their actions and patterns—is an absolutely critical social skill. It can help you avoid precisely those kinds of decisions that can spell years of misery—choosing an incompetent leader, a shady partner, a scheming assistant, or the kind of incompatible spouse who can poison your life. But it is a skill you must consciously develop, because we humans are generally inept when it comes to such assessments. (Greene, 2018)
Social spreading
	•	Viral marketing takes advantage of an underlying psychological phenomenon called social spreading. This is the general tendency of people to mimic their contacts’ behaviours, and to spread gossip, fads, rumours and ideas. This mechanism also acts in innovation adoption, group problem solving, and collective decision making. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
	•	Sociologists and psychologists have found many examples of the striking tendency of humans to ‘copy’ each other. In 1962, a group of girls at a mission school in Tanzania experienced an unusual tendency to uncontrollable laughter. After a few months, tens of pupils of the school showed the same symptoms, and other people in the villages where some of the pupils were sent to rest showed the same disquieting giggling. After much investigation, doctors A. M. Rankin and P. J. Philip, who studied the case, came to the conclusion that it was an instance of ‘mass hysteria’. A similar case was reported in 1998 in a high school in Tennessee, when the experience of a teacher who had the feeling of smelling gasoline spread to hundreds of students. All environmental factors were excluded, and scientists came to the conclusion that a kind of ‘emotional contagion’ was at work. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
	•	Three reasons are behind the fact that people connected share certain features or behaviours. First, there are external factors, such as belonging to the same social class: for example, people belonging to lower social classes have an increased risk of smoking and becoming obese; at the same time they are more likely to establish ties with each other than with people of a higher social class. Second, there is homophily: people that smoke or have similar body mass tend to make friends with those with similar habits. Third, there is social spreading: if you are a friend of somebody who smokes or is overweight, you are more likely to consider taking up smoking or increasing your daily food intake. Probably all three mechanisms are at work, but social spreading is likely to be the least trivial of them and should not be underestimated. Sociologists argue that it’s not a specific condition that spreads; rather, it’s the sharing of norms about what is appropriate that is disseminated. This perspective could be used in public health, to foster safer habits by targeting hubs in social networks. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
	•	Naturally, the contagion of behaviours, as well as rumours and ideas, is different in many respects from that of diseases. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
Social structure
	•	social sciences have widely deployed the concept of network to represent social structure. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
Social system
	•	social system in which the individual is expected to operate (Douglas, 2005:144)
	•	In social systems, certain human groups may be totally separated from others (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
Social trouble
	•	Leur petit nombre40 permet de les considérer comme des cas relativement exceptionnels et de les expliquer par la pathologie sociale ou organique. Si certains individus se refusent à la loi commune, se démarquent par leur agressivité ou par leur délire, ce ne peut être imputable qu’à un trouble. (Mannoni, 1985)
Social trust
	•	It is a precondition for successf probably a necessary condition. (Sjöberg, 2008)
Socialism
	•	Le grand facteur de l'évolution des peuples n'a jamais été la vérité, mais bien l'erreur. Et si le socialisme est si puissant aujourd'hui, c'est qu'il constitue la seule illusion qui soit vivante encore. Malgré toutes les démonstrations scientifiques, il continue à grandir. Sa principale force est d'être défendu par des esprits ignorant assez les réalités des choses pour oser promettre hardiment à l'homme le bonheur. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	L'absurdité philosophique que présentent souvent les croyances générales n'a jamais été un obstacle à leur triomphe. Ce triomphe ne semble même possible qu'à la condition qu'elles renferment quelque mystérieuse absurdité. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Ce n'est donc pas l'évidente faiblesse des croyances socialistes actuelles qui les empêchera de triompher dans l'âme des foules. Leur véritable infériorité par rapport à toutes les croyances religieuses tient uniquement à ceci: l'idéal de bonheur que promettaient ces dernières ne devant être réalisé que dans une vie future, personne ne pouvait contester cette réalisation. L'idéal de bonheur socialiste devant être réalisé sur terre, dès les premières tentatives de réalisation, la vanité des promesses apparaîtra aussitôt, et la croyance nouvelle perdra du même coup tout prestige. (Lebon, 1895)
Socialization process
	•	Les manuels de psychologie sociale abordent, en général, les processus de socialisation de l’homme, c’est-à-dire des rapports de l’individu avec d’autres individus ou avec une société. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	l’homme est entièrement façonné par son dressage éducationnel, c’est-à-dire par sa socialisation. (Mannoni, 1985)
Societal activities
	•	Societal activities fall into two general categories—those in which the individual participates on a "voluntary" basis and those in which the participation is "involuntary," imposed by the society in which the individual lives (Starr, 1969)
Voluntary activities
	•	In the case of "voluntary" activities, the individual uses his own value sys- tem to evaluate his experiences. Al though his eventual trade-off may not be consciously or analytically determined, or based upon objective knowledge, it nevertheless is likely to represent, for that individual, a crude optimization appropriate to his value system. (Starr, 1969)
	•	such an individual optimization process can be comparatively rapid (because the feedback of experience to the individual is rapid), so the statistical pattern for a large social group may be an important "real-time" indicator of societal trade-offs and values (Starr, 1969)
Involuntary activities
	•	"Involuntary" activities differ in that the criteria and options are determined not by the individuals affected but by a controlling body. Such control may be in the hands of a government agency, a political entity, a leadership group, an assembly of authorities or "opinion-makers," or a combination of such bodies. Because of the complexity of large societies, only the control group is likely to be fully aware of all the criteria and options involved in their decision process. Further, the time required for feedback of the experience that results from the con- trolling decisions is likely to be very long. The feedback of cumulative individual experiences into societal communication channels (usually political or economic) is a slow process, as is the process of altering the planning of the control group. (Starr, 1969)
	•	real-time pattern of societal trade-offs on "involuntary" activities must be considered in terms of the particular dynamics of approach to an acceptable balance of social values and costs. (Starr, 1969)
	•	In examining the historical benefit-risk relationships for "involuntary" activities, it is important to recognize the perturbing role of public psychological acceptance of risk arising from the influence of authorities or dogma. (Starr, 1969)
Societal risk
	•	societal risk intrinsically revolves around social relations as much as around evaluations of probability. (Rayner and Cantor, 1987)
	•	Three notions have dominated discussions of societal risk management since Chauncey Starr’s seminal article in 1969. The first of these is that there is a definable (i.e., measurable) phenomenon called risk. Second is that societal risk management is concerned with minimizing the probability and/or magnitude of undesired consequences without incurring excessive costs. Third is the assumption that the critical question facing risk managers charged with thiss delicate balancing act is “How safe is safe enough?. (Rayner and Cantor, 1987)
	•	The consequences of a major accident however go much wider than injury toparticular people, or to sets of people (Great Britain and Health and Safety Executive, 1992)
	•	a large scale accident raises questions of responsibility for safety and public accountability in a way that accidents to individuals do not. (Great Britain and Health and Safety Executive, 1992)
	•	To estimate such large events, we use the term 'societal risk', and in doing so, we have to consider not only the many different forms an accident could take, but the multiple consequences involved and their cost or severity. (Great Britain and Health and Safety Executive, 1992)
	•	More broadly, societal risk can be represented as a 'detriment', viz the product of the total amount of damage caused by a major accident and the probability of this happening during some defined period of time. (Great Britain and Health and Safety Executive, 1992)
Societal values
	•	Societal values are particularly difficult to describe and quantify but often have the greatest influence on the decision-making process. (Williams and Paustenbach, 2002)
	•	Reference to a highly appreciated social value may increase the receiver’s tolerance for weak evidence. (Kasperson et al., 1988)
Society
	•	La société, ainsi que nous l’avons décrite plus haut, s’enveloppe comme d’un manteau des formes sages de la vie communautaire. Cet ordre qu’elle entretient autour d’elle est, en réalité, une véritable ligne de défense contre toute mobilité ou déformation qui porte toujours en germes, nous l’avons également dit, une menace de déchirure. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Mr. Martin pictures society as an aggregation of people who have sacrificed individual freedom in order to remain within the group. This sacrifice of freedom on the part of individuals in the group leads its members to resist all efforts at fundamental changes in the group code. Because all have made certain sacrifices, reasons are developed why such sacrifices must be insisted upon at all times. The “logic-proof” compartment is the result of this unwillingness to accept changes. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	Each group, therefore, within itself, considers its own standards ultimate and indisputable, and tends to dismiss all contrary or different standards as indefensible.
	•	The main satisfaction, Mr. Martin thinks, which the individual derives from his group association is the satisfaction of his vanity through the creation of an enlarged self-importance. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	Society is not divided into two groups, although it seems so to many. Some see modern society divided into capital and labor. The feminist sees the world divided into men and women. The hungry man sees the rich and the por. The missionary sees the heathen and the faithful. If society were divided into two groups, and no more, then change could come about only through violent upheaval. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	Society is made up of an almost infinite number of groups, whose various interests and desires overlap and interweave inextricably. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	For society, the interesting outcome of this situation is that progress seldom occurs through the abrupt expulsion by a group of its old ideas in favor of new ideas, but rather through the rearrangement of the thought of the individuals in these groups with respect to each other and with respect to the entire membership of society. It is precisely this interlapping of groups—the variety, the inconsistency of the average man’s mental, social and psychological commitments which makes possible the gradual change from one state of affairs or from one state of mind to another. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
Protestant society
	•	[…] Protestant societies celebrated steady hard work as the path to wealth and tended to frown on risk-taking behaviors in general, including gambling (a speculative risk), although they seem to have been friendliest to capitalist speculation (certainly, Protestantism and capitalism are correlated historically). (Newsome, 2013)
Fatalistic society
	•	[…] more fatalistic cultures and socieites (perhaps because of strong beliefs in divine will) tend to be less sensitive to pure risks, although high religiosity is associated with taboos on gambling. (Newsome, 2013)
Frozen society
	•	"Frozen societies" are those which slowed down their historical ac­ tivity to the limit, those which kept their opposition to the natural and human environment, and their internal oppositions, in a constant equilibrium. (Debord, 2012)
Traditional society
	•	Traditional societies tend to encourage recklessness as proof of the individual’s credibility to provide for or defend their prospective partners or followers. These cultures are seen in traditional warrior societies and criminal gangs and also in insecure societies where people are expected to take risks in order to survice. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	C’est donc une tout autre affaire que d’appartenir à une société traditionaliste dont les regards sont essentiellement tournés vers un passé idyllique (âge d’or, paradis perdu), ou à une société « progressiste » dont l’évolution vers un avenir florissant constitue une postulation de base. (Mannoni, 1985)
Primitive society
	•	Primitive societies, according to the neo-Darwinian hypothesis, show that what makes us human is our Machiavellian intelligence which we share with the great apes, especially chimpanzees. (Coker, 2009)
Sociology
	•	Sociology has classified a broad range of possible links between individuals (Table 1). The tendency to have several kinds of relationships in social networks is called multiplexity. But this phenomenon appears in many other networks: for example, two species can be connected by different strategies of predation, two computers by different cables or wireless connections, etc.  (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
Sociometry
	•	sociometry, a technique for identifying relations between individuals. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
Soldier
	•	soldier is obliged to protect the polity if necessary in conditions of extremity. (Gray, 2014)
	•	It is commonplace for soldiers periodically to be angry, at least dissatisfied, over the apparent disregard by politicians of expert military advice on military matters of defence planning. (Gray, 2014)
	•	Soldiers tend to see themselves as deserving of preferential priority because of their unique importance to the first charge on political authority, physical protection of the polity. (Gray, 2014)
	•	soldiers, among others, are likely to be light in understanding, really understanding, the differences there are between their particular responsibilities to the country, and the general responsibilities of the central government. (Gray, 2014)
Sorption
	•	Sorption is a general expression for a process in which a chemical moves from one phase to be accumulated in another, particularly in cases in which the second phase is solid (Weber, 1927b). (Paustenbach, 2002b)
Soul
	•	Think of the modern concept of attitude in terms of the ancient concept of the soul. The concept of the soul is found in almost all indigenous cultures and in premodern civilizations. It originally referred to external spiritual forces permeating the universe and contained in the individual human in the form of the soul. The soul is not the mind or the body but rather the overall spirit we embody, our way of experiencing the world. It is what makes a person an individual, and the concept of the soul was related to the earliest ideas of personality. Under this concept, a person’s soul could have depths. Some people possessed a greater degree of this spiritual force, had more of a soul. Others had a personality lacking in this force and were somewhat soulless. (Greene, 2018)
	•	In our modern conception of the soul, we replace this external spiritual force with life itself, or what can be described as the life force. Life is inherently complex and unpredictable, its powers far beyond anything we can ever completely comprehend or control. This life force is reflected in nature and human society by the remarkable diversity we find in both realms. (Greene, 2018)
Source
	•	Each source has its own unique strengths, weaknesses, potential or actual biases, and vulnerability to manipulation and deception. (Heuer, 1999)
Source assessment
	•	Revisionists emphasize that adhering to the assessment of sources is crucial in order to protect analysts from deception. (Honig, 2007)
	•	If a major analytic assessment is planned, analysts should individually or collectively review the quality of their information and refresh their understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of past reporting on which an analytic line rests. (US Government, 2009)
	•	Without understanding the context and conditions under which critical information has been provided, it will be difficult for analysts to assess the information’s validity and establish a confidence level in an intelligence assessment. (US Government, 2009)
	•	A thorough review of information sources provides analysts—as well as policymakers—with an accurate assessment of “what we know” and “what we do not know.” It is also an opportunity to confirm that sources have been cited accurately. (US Government, 2009)
	•	reviewing technical sourcing can sometimes reveal inadvertent errors in processing, translation, or interpretation that otherwise might have gone unnoticed. (US Government, 2009)
	•	a quality of information check can be valuable to both collectors and policymakers: It can help to detect possible deception and denial strategies by an adversary. It can identify key intelligence gaps and new requirements for collectors. It can assist policymakers in understanding how much confidence analysts are placing on analytic judgments. (US Government, 2009)
Source validity
	•	Weighing the validity of sources is a key feature of any critical thinking. Moreover, establishing how much confidence one puts in analytic judgments should ultimately rest on how accurate and reliable the information base is. (US Government, 2009)
	•	checking the quality of information used in intelligence analysis is an ongoing, continuous process. Having multiple sources on an issue is not a substitute for having good information that has been thoroughly examined. (US Government, 2009)
	•	Analysts should perform periodic checks of the information base for their analytic judgments. Otherwise, important analytic judgments can become anchored to weak information, and any “caveats” attached to those judgments in the past can be forgotten or ignored over time.(US Government, 2009)
Soveraignty
	•	Sovereignty, as defined to mean the right of jurisdiction in a territory to the exclusion of any other state, determines the ground rules for international relations and international law in general and for the delimitation of boundaries in particular (James, 1984: 1). (Beck and Schofield, 1994)
Sparta
	•	Sparta was Athens’s archenemy and in many ways its polar opposite. Athens led a league of democratic states in the region, while Sparta led a confederation of oligarchies, known as the Peloponnesians. Athens depended on its navy and on its wealth—it was the preeminent commercial power in the Mediterranean. Sparta depended on its army. It was a total military state. Up until then, the two powers had largely avoided a direct war because the consequences could be devastating—not only could the defeated side lose its influence in the region, but its whole way of life could be put in jeopardy—certainly for Athens its democracy and its wealth. (Greene, 2018)
Space
Personnal space
	•	From early on in life we humans develop a defensive and self-protective side to our personality. It begins in early childhood as we cultivate a sense of personal physical space that others should not violate. It later expands into a feeling of personal dignity—people should not coerce or manipulate us into doing things we don’t want to. We should be free to choose what we desire. (Greene, 2018)
Spanish
	•	C'est vrai, reprit Danglars, les Français ont cette supériorité sur les Espagnols, que les Espagnols ruminent et que les Français inventent.  (Dumas, 1998)
Specialist
	•	Specialists, like hawks or eagles, have on dominant skill upon which they depend for their survival. (Greene, 2014)
Speaker
	•	Dans une assemblée parlementaire, le succès d'un discours dépend presque uniquement du prestige que l'orateur possède, et pas du tout des raisons qu'il propose. Et, la meilleure preuve, c'est que lorsqu'une cause quelconque fait perdre à un orateur son prestige, il perd du même coup toute son influence, c'est-à-dire le pouvoir de diriger à son gré les votes. Quant à l'orateur inconnu qui arrive avec un discours contenant de bonnes raisons, mais seulement des raisons, il a des chances d'être seulement écouté. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	The sympathy between the orator and his audience is not one which the orator can create. He can intensify it, or by tactless speaking he can dissipate it, but he cannot manufacture it from thin air. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
Species
	•	Species are linked by predation (negative), but also by mutualism (e.g. the positive relation established between flowering plants and pollinators). (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
Basal species
	•	Basal species get energy and matter from sun and environment, but their predators extract just 10 per cent, on average, of the resources conaitned in them, and the same happens at every successive step of predation: if foodchains were too long, top predators would not extract enough from them to survive. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
Intermediate species 
	•	Intermediate species are organisms that are both predators and prey. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
Top species 
	•	top species (at the end of the chain) are those that are not predated by anything. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
Spectacle
	•	The spectacle, therefore, is the mechanism through which power appropriates not common land but everyday life. (Debord, 2012)
	•	the spectacle ‘is not a collection of images; it is a social relation between people that is mediated by images.’. (Debord, 2012)
	•	The spectacle thrives through reducing real opposition to the image of opposition, repackaged as an exchangeable commodity. The Che Guevara t-shirt is the crudest example of recuperation—and there is now a ‘Society of the Spectacle’ clothing line. (Debord, 2012)
	•	the spectacle relies on the impression of coherence and consistency across all of its domains, from its philosophy of history to its immersion in the minutiae of everyday life. (Debord, 2012)
	•	that the spectacle still reigns. (Debord, 2012)
	•	The spectacle’s task, in relation to such upheaval, is to keep up appearances. (Debord, 2012)
	•	In societies where modern conditions of production prevail, all of life presents itself as an immense accumulation of spectacles. Everything that was directly lived has moved away into a representation. (Debord, 2012)
	•	The specialization of images of the world is completed in the world of the autonomous image, where the liar has lied to himself. The spectacle in general, as the concrete inversion of life, is the autonomous movement of the non-living. (Debord, 2012)
	•	The spectacle presents itself simultaneously as all of society, as part of society, and as instrument of unification. As a part of society it is specifically the sector which concentrates all gazing and all consciousness. Due to the very fact that this sector is separate, it is the common ground of the deceived gaze and of false consciousness, and the unification it achieves is nothing but an official language of generalized separation. (Debord, 2012)
	•	The spectacle is not a collection of images, but a social relation among people, mediated by images. (Debord, 2012)
	•	The spectacle cannot be understood as an abuse of the world of vision, as a product of the techniques of mass dissemination of images. It is, rather, a Weltanschauung which has become actual, materially translated. It is a world vision which has become objectified. (Debord, 2012)
	•	The spectacle grasped in its totality is both the result and the project of the existing mode of production. It is not a supplement to the real world, an additional decoration. It is the heart of the unrealism of the real society. In all its specific forms, as information or propaganda, as advertisement or direct entertainment consumption, the spectacle is the present model of socially dominant life. It is the omnipresent affirmation of the choice already made in production and its corollary consumption. (Debord, 2012)
	•	The spectacle’s form and content are identically the total justification of the existing system’s conditions and goals. (Debord, 2012)
	•	The spectacle is also the permanent presence of this justification, since it occupies the main part of the time lived outside of modern production. (Debord, 2012)
	•	The language of the spectacle consists of signs of the ruling production, which at the same time are the ultimate goal of this production. (Debord, 2012)
	•	One cannot abstractly contrast the spectacle to actual social activity: such a division is itself divided. The spectacle which inverts the real is in fact produced. Lived reality is materially invaded by the contemplation of the spectacle while simultaneously absorbing the spectacular order, giving it positive cohesiveness. Objective reality is present on both sides. Every notion fixed this way has no other basis than its passage into the opposite: reality rises up within the spectacle, and the spectacle is real. This reciprocal alienation is the essence and the support of the existing society. (Debord, 2012)
	•	In a world which really is topsy-turvy, the true is a moment of the false.Debord, Guy. Society Of The Spectacle . Bread and Circuses. Kindle Edition. (Debord, 2012)
	•	The concept of spectacle unifies and explains a great diversity of apparent phenomena. The diversity and the contrasts are appearances of a socially organized appearance, the general truth of which must itself be recognized. Considered in its own terms, the spectacle is affirmation of appearance and affirmation of all human life, namely social life, as mere appearance. But the critique which reaches the truth of the spectacle exposes it as the visible negation of life, as a negation of life which has become visible.
	•	To describe the spectacle, its formation, its functions and the forces which tend to dissolve it, one must artificially distinguish certain inseparable elements. When analyzing the spectacle one speaks, to some extent, the language of the spectacular itself in the sense that one moves through the methodological terrain of the very society which expresses itself in the spectacle. But the spectacle is nothing other than the sense of the total practice of a social-economic formation, its use of time. It is the historical movement in which we are caught. (Debord, 2012)
	•	The spectacle presents itself as something enormously positive, indisputable and inaccessible. It says nothing more than “that which appears is good, that which is good appears. The attitude which it demands in principle is passive acceptance which in fact it already obtained by its manner of appearing without reply, by its monopoly of appearance. (Debord, 2012)
	•	The society which rests on modern industry is not accidentally or superficially spectacular, it is fundamentally spectaclist. In the spectacle, which is the image of the ruling economy, the goal is nothing, development everything. The spectacle aims at nothing other than itself. (Debord, 2012)
	•	As the indispensable decoration of the objects produced today, as the general expose of the rationality of the system, as the advanced economic sector which directly shapes a growing multitude of image-objects, the spectacle is the main production of present-day society. (Debord, 2012)
	•	The spectacle subjugates living men to itself to the extent that the economy has totally subjugated them. It is no more than the economy developing for itself. It is the true reflection of the production. (Debord, 2012)
	•	Where the real world changes into simple images, the simple images become real beings and effective motivations of hypnotic behavior. The spectacle, as a tendency to make one see the world by means of various specialized mediations (it can no longer be grasped directly), naturally finds vision to be the privileged human sense which the sense of touch was for other epochs; the most abstract, the most mystifiable sense corresponds to the generalized abstraction of present-day society. But the spectacle is not identifiable with mere gazing, even combined with hearing. It is that which escapes the activity of men, that which escapes reconsideration and correction by their work. It is the opposite of dialogue. Wherever there is independent representation, the spectacle reconstitutes itself. (Debord, 2012)
	•	The spectacle does not realize philosophy, it philosophizes reality. The concrete life of everyone has been degraded into a speculative universe. (Debord, 2012)
	•	The spectacle is the material reconstruction of the religious illusion. (Debord, 2012)
	•	The spectacle is the technical realization of the exile of human powers into a beyond; it is separation perfected within the interior of man. (Debord, 2012)
	•	To the extent that necessity is socially dreamed, the dream becomes necessary. The spectacle is the nightmare of imprisoned modern society which ultimately expresses nothing more than its desire to sleep. The spectacle is the guardian of sleep. (Debord, 2012)
	•	The fact that the practical power of modern society detached itself and built an independent empire in the spectacle can be explained only by the fact that this practical power continued to lack cohesion and remained in contradiction with itself. (Debord, 2012)
	•	The oldest social specialization, the specialization of power, is at the root of the spectacle. The spectacle is thus a specialized activity which speaks for all the others. It is the diplomatic representation of hierarchic society to itself, where all other expression is banned. Here the most modern is also the most archaic. (Debord, 2012)
	•	The spectacle is the existing order’s uninterrupted discourse about itself, its laudatory monologue. It is the self-portrait of power in the epoch of its totalitarian management of the conditions of existence. (Debord, 2012)
	•	The fetishistic, purely objective appearance of spectacular relations conceals the fact that they are relations among men and classes: a second nature with its fatal laws seems to dominate our environment. But the spectacle is not the necessary product of technical development seen as a natural development. The society of the spectacle is on the contrary the form which chooses its own technical content. (Debord, 2012)
	•	If the spectacle, taken in the limited sense of “mass media” which are its most glaring superficial manifestation, seems to invade society as mere equipment, this equipment is in no way neutral but is the very means suited to its total self-movement. (Debord, 2012)
	•	the social needs of the epoch in which such techniques are developed can only be satisfied through their mediation, if the administration of this society and all contact among men can no longer take place except through the intermediary of this power of instantaneous communication, it is because this “communication” is essentially unilateral. The concentration of “communication” is thus an accumulation, in the hands of the existing system’s administration, of the means which allow it to carry on this particular administration. The generalized cleavage of the spectacle is inseparable from the modern State, namely from the general form of cleavage within society, the product of the division of social labor and the organ of class domination. (Debord, 2012)
	•	The sacred has justified the cosmic and ontological order which corresponded to the interests of the masters; it has explained and embellished that which society could not do. Thus all separate power has been spectacular, but the adherence of all to an immobile image only signified the common acceptance of an imaginary prolongation of the poverty of real social activity, still largely felt as a unitary condition. The modern spectacle, on the contrary, expresses what society can do, but in this expression the permitted is absolutely opposed to the possible. The spectacle is the preservation of unconsciousness within the practical change of the conditions of existence. (Debord, 2012)
	•	Due to the success of separate production as production of the separate, the fundamental experience which in primitive societies is attached to a central task is in the process of being displaced, at the crest of the system’s development. by non-work, by inactivity. But this inactivity is in no way liberated from productive activity: it depends on productive activity and is an uneasy and admiring submission to the necessities and results of production; it is itself a product of its rationality. (Debord, 2012)
	•	the abstraction of all specific labor and the general abstraction of the entirety of production are perfectly rendered in the spectacle, whose mode of being concrete is precisely abstraction. In the spectacle, one part of the world represents itself to the world and is superior to it. The spectacle is nothing more than the common language of this separation. What binds the spectators together is no more than an irreversible relation at the very center which maintains their isolation. The spectacle reunites the separate, but reunites it as separate. (Debord, 2012)
	•	The spectacle within society corresponds to a concrete manufacture of alienation. (Debord, 2012)
	•	The spectacle is capital to such a degree of accumulation that it becomes an image. (Debord, 2012)
	•	The spectacle is the moment when the commodity has attained the total occupation of social life. (Debord, 2012)
	•	The spectacle is a permanent opium war which aims to make people identify goods with commodities and satisfaction with survival that increases according to its own laws. (Debord, 2012)
	•	The spectacle is the other side of money: it is the general abstract equivalent of all commodities. Money dominated society as the representation of general equivalence, namely, of the exchangeability of different goods whose uses could not be compared. (Debord, 2012)
	•	The spectacle is the developed modern complement of money where the totality of the commodity world appears as a whole, as a general equivalence for what the entire society can be and can do. (Debord, 2012)
	•	The spectacle, like modern society, is at once unified and divided. Like society, it builds its unity on the disjunction. But the contradiction, when it emerges in the spectacle, is in turn contradicted by a reversal of its meaning, so that the demonstrated division is unitary, while the demonstrated unity is divided. (Debord, 2012)
	•	The root of the spectacle is within the abundant economy the source of the fruits which ultimately take over the spectacular market despite the ideological-police protectionist barriers of local spectacles aspiring to autarchy. (Debord, 2012)
	•	The celebrity, the spectacular representation of a living human being, embodies this banality by embodying the image of a possible role. Being a star means specializing in the seemingly lived; the star is the object of identification with the shallow seeming life that has to compensate for the fragmented productive specializations which are actually lived. Celebrities exist to act out various styles of living and viewing society unfettered, free to express themselves globally. They embody the inaccessible result of social labor by dramatizing its by-products magically projected above it as its goal: power and vacations, decision and consumption, which are the beginning and end of an undiscussed process. (Debord, 2012)
	•	Passing into the spectacle as a model for identification, the agent renounces all autonomous qualities in order to identify himself with the general law of obedience to the course of things. (Debord, 2012)
	•	jWhat hides under the spectacular oppositions is a unity of misery. Behind the masks of total choice, different forms of the same alienation confront each other, all of them built on real contradictions which are repressed. The spectacle exists in a concentrated or a diffuse form depending on the necessities of the particular stage of misery which it denies and supports. In both cases, the spectacle is nothing more than an image of happy unification surrounded by desolation and fear at the tranquil center of misery. (Debord, 2012)
	•	the spectacle of automobiles demands a perfect transport network which destroys old cities, while the spectacle of the city itself requires museum-areas. (Debord, 2012)
	•	Each individual commodity  fights for  itself.  It  avoids acknowledging the others and strives to impose itself every­where as if it were the only one in existence. The spectacle is ·the epic poem of this struggle, a struggle that no fall of Troy can bring to an end. (Debord, 2012)
	•	The satisfaction no longer given by the use of the abundant com­ modity is now sought in its value as a commodity: it is the use of the commodity being sufficient to itself; for the consumer there is religious fervor for the sovereign liberty of the commodity. Waves of enthusiasm for a given product, supported and spread by all the means of information, are thus propagated with lightning speed. (Debord, 2012)
	•	Reified man advertises the proof of his intimacy with the commodity. As in the convulsions or miracles of the old religious fetishism, the fetishism of the" commodity sometimes reaches moments of fervent exaltation. The only use which is still expressed here is the fundamental use ofsubmission. (Debord, 2012)
	•	In the image of the society happily unified by consumption, real division is only suspended until the next non-accomplishment in the consumable. (Debord, 2012)
	•	the object from which one expects a singular power could not have been sug­ gested for the devotion of masses unless it had been produced in numbers large enough to be consumed massively. The prestigious character of a product comes to it only from its having been placed for a mo­ ment at the center of social life, as the revealed mystery of the final goal of production. The object which was prestigious in the spectaclebecomes vulgar the moment it enters the house of the consumer, at the same time that it enters the house of all the others. Too late it reveals its essential poverty, which naturally comes to it from the mis­ ery of its production. But it is already another object which carries the justification of the system and the demand to be acknowledged. (Debord, 2012)
	•	The imposture of satisfaction denounces itself by replacing itself, by following the change of products and the change of the general con­ ditions of production. (Debord, 2012)
	•	The subject of history can be none other than the living producing itself, becoming master and possessor of itsworld which is history, and existing asconsciousness of its game. (Debord, 2012)
	•	This individual experience of seperate daily life remains without language, without concept, without critical access to its own past which has been left nowhere. It is not communicated. It is not understood and is forgotten to the profit of false spectacular memory of the unmemorable. (Debord, 2012)
	•	Immobilized in the falsi­ fied center of the movement of its world, the consciousness of the spectator no longer knows in its l ife a passage towards its rea l ization and towards its death. Whoever has renounced the expenditure of his life can no longer admit his death. (Debord, 2012)
	•	Undoubtedly the critical concept of spectacle can also be vulgarized into some kind of hollow formula of sociologico-political rhetoric to explain and abstractly denounce everything, and thus serve as a defense of the spectacular system. (Debord, 2012)
	•	The spectacle is ideology par excellence, because it exposes and manifests in its fullness the essence of all ideological systems: the impoverishment, the servitude and the negation of real life. The spectacle is materially "the expression of the separation and estrangement between man and man." (Debord, 2012)
	•	Reciprocally, the dreamed activity of idealism is equally completed in the spectacle, through the technical mediation of signs and signals-which finally materialize an abstract ideal. (Debord, 2012)
	•	The spectacle, which is the elimination of the limits between self and world through the destruction of the self besieged by the presence­absence of the world, is equally the elimination of the limits between true and false through the repression of all truth lived under the real presence of the lie ensured by the organization of appearance. (Debord, 2012)
	•	The acceptance and consumption of commodities are at the heart of this pseudo-response to a communication without response. (Debord, 2012)

Old specacle
	•	The sacred has justified the cosmic and ontological order which corresponded to the interests of the masters; it has explained and embellished that which society could not do. Thus all separate power has been spectacular, but the adherence of all to an immobile image only signified the common acceptance of an imaginary prolongation of the poverty of real social activity, still largely felt as a unitary condition. (Debord, 2012)
Modern spectacle
	•	The modern spectacle, on the contrary, expresses what society can do, but in this expression the permitted is absolutely opposed to the possible. The spectacle is the preservation of unconsciousness within the practical change of the conditions of existence. (Debord, 2012)
	•	It is its own product, and it has made its own rules: it is a pseudo-sacred entity. It shows what it is: separate power developing in itself, in the growth of productivity by means of the incessant refinement of the division of labor into a parcellization of gestures which are then dominated by the independent movement of machines; and working for an ever-expanding market. All community and all critical sense are dissolved during this movement in which the forces that could grow by separating are not yet reunited. (Debord, 2012)
Anti-spectacular
	•	Debord mentions a ‘style of negation’ that might counteract the spectacle. (Debord, 2012) 
	•	Debord attempts an anti-spectacular style. He proudly states that this style is ‘a scandal and abomination to the prevailing standards of language and to the sensibilities moulded by those standards’. (Debord, 2012)
Couter-culture spectacle
	•	Debord is inspired by anti-union wildcat strikes and the growing youth counterculture. He regards those people, acting without ‘political legitimacy’, as the agents of the spectacle’s overthrow: New signs of negation are proliferating in the most economically-advanced countries. Although these signs are misunderstood and falsified by the spectacle, they are sufficient proof that a new period has begun. We have already seen the failure of the first proletarian assault against capitalism; now we are witnessing the failure of capitalist abundance. (Debord, 2012)
	•	‘People who destroy commodities show their human superiority over commodities.’[19]  A burning supermarket thus represents a twofold affirmation and negation: a collapsing of the power of commodities; and a celebration of the human refusal to be subordinated to things. His is a poetic interpretation, but perhaps that is its value: to violently poeticise a world that is everywhere administered. (Debord, 2012)
	•	Debord anticipates this argument in his verdict on the Watts rioters who, he says, ‘take modern capitalist propaganda, its publicity of abundance, literally. They want to possess now all the objects shown and abstractly accessible, because they want to use them.’ (Debord, 2012)
Process of spectaculaziation
	•	processes of spectacularisation. Nonetheless, Debord implanted in his book examples of critical practices that might serve to contest and challenge the truth-claims of the spectacle. (Debord, 2012)
	•	Debord introduces the practice of détournement and its role in the anti-spectacular struggle. Détournement is the practice of taking an already-existing expression and re-presenting it to change its meaning. Relatively straightforward examples of détournement include ad-busting and subvertising, billboard liberation and spoof reproductions. (Debord, 2012)
Society of spectacle
	•	The Society of the Spectacle attempts to identify the characteristics of the phase of capitalism that Debord and his co-conspirators called ‘the spectacle’. Debord offers a panoramic survey of how the spectacle affects our understandings of time, history, the operations of power and the media, the built environments in which we live, our social relations and our subjective experiences. He also ruminates on the privileges and the limits of art and of cultural activity in resisting the operations of the spectacle. (Debord, 2012)
	•	The Society of the Spectacle is a book about representation: representation as a philosophical dilemma dating back to Plato; representation as the root function of the media; political representation and representatives; and, most importantly, the control of representations as the spectacle’s mechanism of power. More specifically, it is a book about the alienating effects of representation. (Debord, 2012)
	•	Retort argue that Debord’s book is the analysis of a later stage of the same process, in which the spectacle is  a first stab at characterizing a new form of, or stage in, the accumulation of capital. What it named primarily was the submission of more and more facets of human sociability—areas of everyday life, forms of recreation, patterns of speech, idioms of local solidarity, kinds of ethical or aesthetic insubordination, the endless capacities of human beings to evade or refuse the orders brought down on them from on high—to the deadly solicitations (the lifeless bright sameness) of the market.[4] The spectacle, therefore, is the mechanism through which power appropriates not common land but everyday life. (Debord, 2012)
	•	‘This book should be read in mind that it was written with the deliberate intention of doing harm to spectacular society’, to which he playfully added, ‘There was never anything outrageous, however, about what it had to say.’ (Debord, 2012)
	•	spectacle can hollow-out any gesture of resistance, re-represent it, and divest it of its radical content. (Debord, 2012)
	•	The spectacle thrives through reducing real opposition to the image of opposition, repackaged as an exchangeable commodity. The Che Guevara t-shirt is the crudest example of recuperation—and there is now a ‘Society of the Spectacle’ clothing line. (Debord, 2012)
	•	Debord’s analysis recognises the spectacle’s total operations and the necessity of launching a counter-offense at that level of totality. It is not enough to only critique isolated phenomena—such tactics will be recuperated and will consolidate the spectacle’s illusion of flawlessness. Indeed, the spectacle relies on the impression of coherence and consistency across all of its domains, from its philosophy of history to its immersion in the minutiae of everyday life. (Debord, 2012)
	•	We can read The Society of the Spectacle, therefore, as a theoretical analysis and also as a demonstration of a mode of thought, expression and language that is incommensurable with the spectacle’s treatment of thought, expression and language. Debord very rarely dares to propose anti-spectacular tactics—he is wary of their being recuperated once articulated—but one of the few tactics that he does offer relates precisely to the conjuncture of thought, expression and language. (Debord, 2012)
	•	The Society of the Spectacle demonstrates détournement through its many phrases that Debord has appropriated from other writers and rephrased to become antagonistic and inflammatory. At the most basic level, Debord’s stolen phrases act against private property and copyright law. He tells us, in a phrase that is itself stolen from the nineteenth century plagiarist Comte de Lautréamont, that ‘Plagiarism is necessary. Progress depends on it. It sticks close to an author’s phrasing, exploits his expressions, deletes a false idea, replaces it with the right one.’[11]  Where recuperation makes radical things benign, détournement makes benign or even reactionary things radical; détournement exacerbates the contradictions that the spectacle attempts to smooth over. ‘Détournement’, Debord writes, ‘is the flexible language of anti-ideology’[12]. To recognise the role of détournement in this book is to recognise the undoing, however transiently, of the spectacle’s operations. (Debord, 2012)
	•	The Society of the Spectacle, written nearly half a century ago, describes the emergence and development of the ideology of a phase of capitalism, neoliberalism, which is now in re-development. (Debord, 2012)
	•	Debord’s argument certainly speaks of how revolutionary efforts can be surreptitiously recuperated, of how easily the democratic impulse can be subsumed to the demands of capital. (Debord, 2012)
	•	Tout se résume, pour les media, et quel que soit pratiquement le sujet traité (politique, science, technique, social), à monter un spectacle, avec tout ce que cela suppose de mise en scène, de dramatisation, de rebondissements, de suspens, de jeu de silhouettes familières ou, au contraire, surprenantes. Les media c'es le théâtre sans le théâtre. Et lorsque S. Moscovici (op. cit., p. 281) nous dit que « l’art du gouvernement n’est plus un art de la séduction, mais un art (une science ?) de la communication », on peut se demander s'il ne profère pas un magistral pléonasme. Aucun candidat moderne à une magistrature ou à un pouvoir ne saurait se passer, en effet, d'un conseiller en matière de communication. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Quant au contenu des discours politiques, leur analyse, comme le montre bien celle de R. Ghiglione et de ses collaborateurs (1989, p. 30 sq.), révèle la « restauration de la de la rhétorique (pour ne pas dire la sophistique). (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Et même si l’on peut dire aujourd’hui que le médiatique prime le politique, il convient de rajouter que l’un comme l’autre sont assujettis à l’impératif catégorique du spectaculaire : plaire. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	L’objectif reste la recherche systématique de l’impact qui assure aux media la fidélité de leur public. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	La masse se nourrit de ces mythes, pour ne pas dire ces chimères, que lui proposent les spécialistes de l’information. Eux-mêmes soumis à la loi du sensationnalisme, ces derniers en viennent spontanément à dramatiser le fait qu’ils présentent pour le rendre plus intéressant, pour être plus sûrs de frapper le public. Ils choisissent donc les effets les plus spectaculaires, enrichissent artificiellement l’événement, le gonflent, le colorent, recourent aux clichés, et au style hagiographique, en un mot, ils créent une pseudo-réalité que leur zèle propulse sur le devant de la scène. Souvent, sans bien s’en rendre compte, les journalistes en arrivent à se faire les relais amplificateurs de « bruits » sans fondement et à participer au renforcement des inquiétudes. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	La vie sociale est, par eux, en effet, considérablement influencée à divers niveaux qui vont de la mode vestimentaire et musicale à la détermination des attitudes regardant les relations familiales, le mariage, et de celles qui régissent les options politiques. Non seulement la télévision et la presse influent sur la silhouette des femmes, leur coiffure et leur maquillage, mais elles déterminent également leur manière d’être dans l’existence de tous les jours, fixent leurs choix concernant les partenaires amoureux, les enfants, les objets de consommation. Les infiltrations subconscientes des images télévisées notamment donnent à celles-ci la force de modèles agissant dans le sens de la prescription d'une véritable way of life. (Mannoni, 1985)

	•	Basées surtout sur la peur liée au contexte historico-social, les psychoses collectives puisent également leurs sources dans le goût du mystère, de l’extradordinaire et la dascination du spectaculaire.

	•	les représentations théâtrales, qui donnent l'image sous sa forme la plus nettement visible, ont-elles toujours une énorme influence sur les foules. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Rien ne frappe davantage l'imagination des foules de toutes catégories que les représentations théâtrales. Toute la salle éprouve en même temps les mêmes émotions, et si ces émotions ne se transforment pas aussitôt en actes, c'est que le spectateur le plus inconscient ne peut ignorer qu'il est victime d'illusions, et qu'il a ri ou pleuré à d'imaginaires aventures. Parfois cependant les sentiments suggérés par les images sont si forts qu'ils tendent, comme les suggestions habituelles, à se transformer en actes. (Lebon, 1895)
Spectacular time
	•	Consumable pseudo-cyclical time is spectacular time, at once as the time for the consumption of images in the limited sense, and as the image of the consumption of time in the broad sense. (Debord, 2012)
	•	Time for the con­ sumption of images, the medium of all commodities, is inseparably tl · ·� field where the instruments of the spectacle fully take over, as well as the goal which these instruments present globally as the place and the central aspect of all particular consumptions: it is known that the sav­ ing of time constantly sought by modern society-whether in the form of the speed of transport vehicles or in the use of dried soups-is posi­ tively translated for the population ofthe United States by the fact that151merely the contemplation of television occupies an average of three to six hours a day. The social image of the consumption of time, in turn, is exclusively dominated by moments of leisure and vacation, moments represented at a distance and desirable by postulate, as are all spectacular commodities. This commodity is here explicitly given as the mo­ ment of real life whose cyclical return is awaited. But even in these as­ signed moments of life, it is again the spectacle which is to be seen and reproduced, attaining a more intense degree. That which was represented as genuine life is exposed as simply more genuinelv spectacular life. (Debord, 2012)
	•	This epoch which shows itself its time as being essentially the sudden return of multiple festivities is at the same time an epoch without festi­ vals. What had been the moment of participation of a community in the luxurious expenditure of life within cyclical time is impossible for the society without community and without luxury. When its vulgar­ ized pseudo-festivals, parodies of the dialogue and the gift, incite a surplus of economic expenditure, they only lead to deception always compensated by the promise of a new deception. The more its use value-is reduced, the higher the claims of modern survival time are in the spectacle. The reality of time has been replaced by the advertise­ ment of time. (Debord, 2012)
	•	While cyclical time was the time of immobile illusion, really lived, spectacular time is the time of changing reality, lived in illusion. (Debord, 2012)
Speculation
	•	en spéculation, vous le savez, tout est bonheur et malheur. (Dumas, 1998)
Spirit
	•	Analytic empathy comes mostly through conversation and gathering information that will allow you to get inside the spirit of others. (Greene, 2018)
Speed
	•	speed is often counter-productive. (Coker, 2009)
	•	Speed also deprives us of contact, or direct experience of the enemy, which is usually fatal when a war does not end in a formal cessation of hostilities. (Coker, 2009)
	•	Speed is not a phenomenon in itself; it is a relationship in this case between ourselves and war. (Coker, 2009)
	•	Speed implies ease of movement. (Coker, 2009)
	•	Speed is inherently paradoxical. (Coker, 2009)
	•	speed often poses a new set of risks: it increases the chances of failure. (Coker, 2009)
	•	speed often has no strategic significance and it takes no account of history. (Coker, 2009)
	•	speed is essential in information-processing, which has been speeding up all the time. (Coker, 2009)
	•	Rapid advances in technology increasingly democratize the ability to kill. (Freier, 2009)
Speech act
	•	Facilitating conditions are the conditions under whichthe speech act works, in contrast to cases in which the act misfires or isabused (Austin 1975 [1962]). (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	Conditions for a successful speech act fallinto two categories: (1) the internal, linguistic-grammatical—to follow therules of the act (or, as Austin argues, accepted conventional proceduresmust exist, and the act has to be executed according to these procedures),and (2) the external, contextual and social—to hold a position from whichthe act can be made ("The particular persons and circumstances in a givencase must be appropriate for the invocation of the particular procedureinvoked" [Austin 1975 (1962): 34]).A successful speech act is a combination of language and society, ofboth intrinsic features of speech and the group that authorizes and recog-nizes that speech (Bourdieu 1991 [1982]; Butler 1996a, b). (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	Among the nternal conditions of a speech act, the most important is to follow the secu-rity form, the grammar of security, and construct a plot that includes exis-tential threat, point of no return, and a possible way out—the general gram-mar of security as such plus the particular dialects of the different sectors,such as talk identity in the societal sector, recognition and sovereignty inthe political sector, sustainability in the environmental sector, and so on (cf.Waver 1996b). (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	The external aspect of a speech act has two main condi-tions. One is the social capital of the enunciator, the securitizing actor, whomust be in a position of authority, although this should not be defined asofficial authority. (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	The other external condition has to do with threat. It ismore likely that one can conjure a security threat if certain objects can bereferred to that are generally held to be threatening—be they tanks, hostilesentiments, or polluted waters. In themselves, these objects never mice fornecessary securitization, but they are definitely facilitating conditions. (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	After thus subdividing the social, external speech-act conditions intoactor authority and threat related, we can sum up the facilitating conditionsas follows: (1) the demand internal to the speech act of following the gram-mar of security, (2) the social conditions regarding the position of authorityfor the securitizing actor—that is, the relationship between speaker andaudience and thereby the likelihood of the audience accepting the claimsmade in a securitizing attempt, and (3) features of the alleged threats thateither facilitate or impede securitization. (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	The speech-act approach says only that it is the actor who by securitizing an issue—andthe audience by accepting the claim—makes it a security issue. At thatlevel, the analyst cannot and should not replace the actor. (Buzan et al., 1997)

Spirit
Flexible spirit
	•	This flexible, open spirit is similar to creative energy—a willingness to consider more possibilities and options. In fact, developing your empathy will also improve your creative powers. (Greene, 2018)
Group spirit
	•	He would have to monitor their group spirit even more closely than the changing weather. (Greene, 2018)
Open spirit
	•	This flexible, open spirit is similar to creative energy—a willingness to consider more possibilities and options. In fact, developing your empathy will also improve your creative powers. (Greene, 2018)
Staffing
	•	the  use  of  effective  staffing  practices, however, might benefit  most organizations, regardless of varying internal or external contingency factors. (Terpstra and Rozell, 2006)
	•	Staffing is broadly defined as the process of attracting, selecting, and retaining competent individuals to achieve organizational goals. (Ployhart, 2006)
	•	organizational decision makers recognize staffing as a key strategic opportunity for enhancing competitive advantage. (Ployhart, 2006)
	•	although staffing should be one of the most important strategic mechanisms for  achieving competitive advantage, organizational decision makers do not  understandstaffing or use it optimally. (Ployhart, 2006)
	•	Given that the war for talent is very real and relevant to organizations around the globe, it is critical that organizations and organizational scholars recognize the value of staffing. (Ployhart, 2006)
	•	research suggests that organizations using well-developed staffing practices have better performance (Huselid, 1995). (Ployhart, 2006)
	•	Staffing practicesshould help an organization achieve its strategic goals and vision. (Ployhart, 2006)
	•	the value of staffing by examining the relationships between individual differences/human capital with individual outcomes/unit-level outcomes. (Ployhart, 2006)
	•	Staffing quality and project complexity were selected as constructs of interest because they are two aspects of team life that have received considerable attention in research on team effectiveness (see below) and they are factors that can be directly affected by management practice. (McComb et al., 2007)
Standards
	•	Standards can be regarded as generic control measures that must be applied to eliminate or reduce the risks for a particular hazard. The scope of the standard is set by specifying the circumstances in which the hazards give rise to the risk. (Great Britain and Health and Safety Executive, 2001) 
	•	One feature of using standards is that once adopted they may be regarded as applying to the hazard rather than to the risk in the sense that they are applied to control risks whatever the circumstances, for example, however short the actual exposure to the hazard. (Great Britain and Health and Safety Executive, 2001)
	•	Standards describe how concepts should be understood and how activities should be performed (Newsome, 2013)

Standard setting
	•	standard-setting raises dramatic questions about the valuation of human life or the way one risk is weighed against another. (Hood et al., 2001)
	•	Central to regulation is the setting of standards, goals, targets, guidelines. (Hood et al., 2001)
	•	much writing about risk and its regulation focuses on standard-setting, since it raises distinctive issues about the value of life and acceptable levels and distributions of risk (see Heimann 1997). (Hood et al., 2001)
	•	There are many different ways of setting standards in risk regulation. Standards sometimes emerge from a technocratic process applying received technical approaches, drawing on systematic tests or inquiries or reading across from other domains or countries, as in the case of nuclear safety (see Cheit 1990). In other cases, standards sometimes emerge from bargaining among participants with different interests, producing solutions that represent a compromise between rival positions or the interests of different parties, such as in the case of greenhouse gas or occupational safety standards. By contrast, in other cases standards may come from stab-in-the-dark activity, when regulators pluck numerical or qualitative criteria out of the air in some way. Risk regulation often involves a mixture of such standard-setting approaches. (Hood et al., 2001)
	•	Andrew Dunsire (1990), drawing on cybernetic analysis, distinguishes between simple steering, homeostatic control, and control through opposed maximizers—he terms the latter ‘collibration’. (Hood et al., 2001)
Simple steering
	•	Simple steering comprises standards or targets that are set by direct judgement and often not separated institutionally from information-gathering and behaviour-modification. (Hood et al., 2001)
Homeostatic control
	•	A ‘homeostatic’ standard involves specifying an acceptable level of risk in quantitative or qualitative terms, with the intention of keeping the state of the system at or below that level. (Hood et al., 2001)
	•	Such acceptable-risk standards do not consist of a balancing act that needs to be conducted among rival principles in every case, but of a threshold or maximum to be observed. (Hood et al., 2001)
Collibration
	•	‘collibration’ standard consists of some process in which rival and contradictory desiderata—for instance, of risk against cost, risk against risk, or risk against time and convenience—are maintained in some sort of tension, with a balance-tipping or optimization mechanism. (Hood et al., 2001)
Standardization
	•	Standardization is the process of defining standards for behaviour and understanding (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Standardization certainly helps interoperability and accountability and may replace inferior practices with superior practices. (Newsome, 2013)
Standardized
	•	[…]’standardized’, in the sense that data recorded on different subjects (even by different researchers) must be able to be compared. (Corbetta, 2003)
Standpoint
	•	Il y a deux regards : le regard du corps et le regard de l'âme. Le regard du corps peut oublier parfois, mais celui de l'âme se souvient toujours. (Dumas, 1998)
Start up
	•	In the sciences or business, a certain way of thinking or acting that once had success quickly becomes a paradigm, an established procedure. (Greene, 2014)
State 
	•	Laws, like Newton’s laws of gravity or Maxwell’s laws of electromagnetism, are the counterpart of the rules of chess. States, such as the state of an economy, are the counterpart of particular configurations of pieces on the chessboard. As in chess, the laws determine the ways in which the states can change over time. In complex physical systems, laws constrain the way in which a given initial state can change. (Holland, 2014)
Role state
	•	The role state cares about its image and conforms to existing international norms (Shih, 2012)
Ego state
	•	the ego state enacts a role reflecting the internal identity to the effect of reforming or even defying existing international norms (Shih, 2012)
	•	Leaders of an ego state stress their freedom to act based on what they consider appropriate for their state even at the expense of others. (Shih, 2012)
Modern state
	•	[…] each modern state is the product of its own historical experience, each has also been shaped by more general historical processes. The most important of these for our purposes include the philosophies (political, economic, social and scientific) of Enlightenment rationalism, the rivalry of competing nationalisms, the processes of industrialization and, finally, the bureaucratization of decision making. (Dillon, 1988)
	•	Modern states were created through war and existed to pursue it in pursuit of a social vision. (Coker, 2009)
Today’s states
	•	today’s states wage wars which have no political or social function. (Coker, 2009)
Stateman
	•	Une des fonctions les plus essentielles des hommes d'État consiste donc à baptiser de mots populaires, ou au moins neutres, les choses que les foules ne peuvent supporter avec leurs anciens noms. La puissance des mots est si grande qu'il suffit de désigner par des termes bien choisis les choses les plus odieuses pour les faire accepter des foules. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	L'art des gouvernants, comme celui des avocats, consiste surtout à savoir manier les mots. Une des grandes difficultés de cet art est que, dans une même société, les mêmes mots ont le plus souvent des sens fort différents pour les diverses couches sociales. Elles emploient en apparence les mêmes mots; mais elles ne parlent jamais la même langue. (Lebon, 1895)
State agencies
	•	Because of their regulatory powers, these state agencies effectively hold a potential veto over the commercialization of any nuclear technology. (Rayner and Cantor, 1987)
State of mind
	•	The normal state of your mind is that you have intuitive feelings and opinions about almost everything that comes your way (Kahneman, 2012)
Star
	•	The celebrity, the spectacular representation of a living human being, embodies this banality by embodying the image of a possible role. Being a star means specializing in the seemingly lived; the star is the object of identification with the shallow seeming life that has to compensate for the fragmented productive specializations which are actually lived. Celebrities exist to act out various styles of living and viewing society unfettered, free to express themselves globally. They embody the inaccessible result of social labor by dramatizing its by-products magically projected above it as its goal: power and vacations, decision and consumption, which are the beginning and end of an undiscussed process. (Debord, 2012)
Movie star
	•	They turn their faces and their presence into screens upon which people can project their own fantasies. What you want in general is to create an air of mystery and to attract interpretations. (Greene, 2018)
Rising star
	•	With those who are not leaders but are trying to assert themselves as if they were, your response should depend on their personality type. If they are rising stars, full of Self-belief and a sense of destiny, it might be wise to try to rise with them. You will notice such types by the positive energy that surrounds them. (Greene, 2018)
Stigmata
	•	a sign of true grace from God. (Greene, 2018)
Strategic environement
Modern strategic environement
	•	A product of many factors, not least the modern state itself, that environement is distinguished by nuclear, industrial and technological dynamics. (Dillon, 1988)
Stalinism
	•	Stalinism was the reign of terror within the bureaucratic class itself. The terrorism at the base of the power of this class must also strike this class because it possesses no juridical guarantee, no recognized existence as owning class, which it could extend to every one of its members. (Debord, 2012)
Statistics
Statistical analysis
	•	statistical analysis can provide detailed assessment of patterns of responses (Driscoll et al., 2007)
Statistical thinking
	•	Statistical thinking derives conclusions about individual cases from properties of categories and ensembles. (Kahneman, 2012)
Stationary
	•	Stationarity means that a time series reverts back to its mean after a random shock. (Kleinnijenhuis et al., 2015)
Statistical data
	•	Statistical data may be broadly divided into two categories: frequentist statistics, based on empirical data, and so-called Bayesian statistics, based on subjective estimates. (Weiss, 2008)
Frequentist statistics
	•	Frequentist statistics are available on such subjects as the relation between traffic fatalities and miles driven by road, or between asthma cases and exposure to a given level of particulate pollution of a certain particle size. (Weiss, 2008)
	•	In principle, frequentist data can be straightforwardly communicated to a client to guide his or her decision. Actual practice can be more complicated. (Weiss, 2008)
	•	First of all, frequentist statistics can demonstrate correlation, but cannot demonstrate proof. This fact is implicitly acknowledged in disciplines as far removed from each other as criminal law and epidemiology, both of which insist that a correlation be complemented by external evidence before it can be accepted as proof. (Weiss, 2008)
	•	the ‘‘conjunctive problem,’’ which arises when an evidentiary conclusion depends on a series of uncertain events, each of which must be true if the overall conclusion is to hold. Here the laws of probability require that the probabilities of each individual link in a chain of evidence be multiplied in order to give the probability of the overall conclusion. In practice, this may not be intuitively obvious to the person to whom the statistical evidence is being communicated. Nor is it built into the legal process. (Weiss, 2008)
	•	Unfortunately, except in certain long lasting and slowly changing strategic situations, frequentist statistics are typically unavailable to intelligence analysts—or if they are available, must be based on a very small sample of past events. (Weiss, 2008)
Bayesian statistics
	•	Bayesian statistics, by contrast, are subjective estimates of the truth of a given statement—the odds an analyst would take on a bet that the statement will turn out to be true when all the facts are known. (Weiss, 2008)
Statistical methods
	•	Statistical methods rely on probability distributions whereas machine-learning methods are based on algorithms. Ultimately, the two approaches help us learn new facts about the phenomenon we study. The methods used should be flexible enough for us to discover not only what we are searching for, but also trends and facts that might not be on our radar. The known unknowns are rather easier to find than the unknown unknowns. Data mining should be equally good for both. (Haider, 2016)

Stereotype
	•	Les uns et les autres sont des expressions d’idées admises par les individus, en fonction de leur appartenance de classe et de leur adhésion implicite aux jugements circulant dans leur groupe. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	En ajoutant qu’ « en même temps ils localisent certaines pulsions inconscientes ». (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	le préjugé et le stéréotype relèvent de l’irrationnel. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	préjugés et stéréotypes servent de « ciment » social : ils semblent remplir dans le groupe une fonction de réduction des tensions et de renforcement de la solidarité intragroupale. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	describing stereotypes as a “repertory of fixed impressions” that “we carry around in our heads,” rigid mental templates that frame individual experience in an increasingly anonymous world. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	As central components of people’s mental equipment, Lippmann described stereotypes as the “foundations” of their “universe.” (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	Given the comfort that this “repertory of stereotypes” affords us, he concluded, …[A]ny disturbance of the stereotypes seems like an attack on the foundations of the universe. It is an attack on the foundations of our universe. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	“stereotypes,” are shorthand by which human effort is minimized. They are so clearly and commonly understood that every one will immediately respond to the mention of the stereotype within his personal experience. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	We all have stereotypes which minimize not only our thinking habits but also the ordinary routine of life. Mr. Lippmann finds that the stereotypes at the center of the code by which various sections of the public live, “largely determine what group of facts we shall see and in what light we shall see them.” (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	The stereotype is the basis of a large part of the work of the public relations counsel. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
Racial stereotype
	•	dans le cas des préjugés raciaux et religieux17, qui sont parmi les plus répandus et les plus dangereux du fait de leurs caractéristiques passionnelles. (Mannoni, 1985)
Religious stereotype
	•	dans le cas des préjugés raciaux et religieux17, qui sont parmi les plus répandus et les plus dangereux du fait de leurs caractéristiques passionnelles,
Story
	•	Stories have always been effective tools to transmit human experience. (Haider, 2016)
Story telling
	•	We chose story-telling as a mode of transmitting risk information because it provides the flexibility and creative opportunity to build in cultural references, and the format necessary to emphasize the "personal experiences" of others in responding to risk information. (Golding et al., 1992)
Strange
	•	Today, the word ‘strange’ is used to describe the geometry of the attractor, specifically the fact that it is a fractal. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
Strategic assumption
	•	trategic assumptions often emerge as genuine causal forces in a nontrivial way. (Hopple, 1984)
	•	Strategic assumptions are almost invariably plausible (at least before the fact). They are also reinforced by the other side's active deception. (Hopple, 1984)
	•	Strategic assumptions may refer to capabilities or intentions (or both); they may concern basic defense postures and often reflect sensible but ultimately wrong recipes for preventing war. (Hopple, 1984)
Strategic balance
	•	Strategic balance is described in the CCJO as a  exible force structure that depends on rapid adaptability to threats. In this concept, adaptability is a central force characteristic that acknowledges that predicting and preparing for every threat is unrealistic. (Mauk, 2010)
	•	The de nition of strategic balance in a context that appropriately considers national risk and affordability is essential. (Mauk, 2010)
Strategic behaviour
	•	Purposefully strategic behaviour effectively has been a constant theme in the history of the human race. (Gray, 2014)
Strategic communication
	•	essentially the message that the government wants to release. (Newsome, 2013)
Strategic history
	•	The fact that strategic history is not and can never be a source of evidence to be mined in search of reliable guidance for the future, is simply beside the parametric point that history is all we have. (Gray, 2014)
Strategic management
	•	Strategic management can be considered as a collection of decisions and actions taken by the business management in consultation with all levels within the company to determine the long-term activities of the company. (Houben et al., 1999)
	•	Strategic management includes three basic elements, namely: the formulation of a strategy; the implementation of a strategy; the control and evaluation of the strategy.  (Houben et al., 1999)

Strategic narratives
	•	Strategic narratives are vitally important: we ask what any particular war is about; what is its subtext, or its principal theme. (Coker, 2009)
	•	Strategic coherence is narrative-based which is why in an age of blogging, twenty-four-hour news channels, digital media, global TV stations and the internet, it is particularly difficult to control the story being told. (Coker, 2009)
Strategic planning
	•	Strategic planning carries too much controversial conceptual baggage (over what is, and what is not, strategic) that is apt to mislead, and also a small but notable risk of encouraging an undue diffusion of attention away from military matters, given that the military patent on strategy is now well and truly lapsed. (Gray, 2014)
	•	Strategy and Defence Planning is policy relevant, but not policy-oriented. (Gray, 2014)

Strategic prediction
	•	The relative frequencies interpretation that is so widespread in the sciences is just not available in the cases of strategic prediction. (Rosenberg, 2008)

Strategic risk
	•	I define a strategic risk to be an adverse event whose likelihood can be diminished by the possession of armed forces or consequences mitigated through the use of armed force. (Thomson, 2012)
	•	Other definitions of strategic risk are of course possible—there is at least one for each of the myriad ways in which the word strategic can be used—but this one suits my purposes. (Thomson, 2012)
	•	strategic risks – risk that arise from, or could be reduced by, the use of armed force. (Frühling, 2014)
	•	Not all strategic risks are of an equal character or consequence. (Frühling, 2014)
	•	Strategic risks are also sometimes defined in terms of types of conflict or actors causing them, in which case they are often framed and conceived of as broader global phenomena. (Frühling, 2014)
	•	strategic risks are multi-dimensional and cannot easily be reduced to two dimensions. A single measure of probability cannot capture the various types of uncertainty that affect anestimate of the likelihood associated with a strategic risk. (Frühling, 2014)
	•	Strategic risks may become more or less likely than previously assessed, or the materialization of a risk may even become a certainty. (Frühling, 2014)
Strategic risk management
	•	An indispensable aspect of managing strategic risks through the defence effort is the development of a strategy. (Frühling, 2014)
	•	the logic of managing strategic risk through the maintenance of armed forces always rests on the assumption that they may, one day, be used on operations. (Frühling, 2014)
	•	Ideally, strategy should lay out all the physical, psychological and political cause – effect relationships that are expected to translate that threat or use of physical violence into the reduction of specific strategic risks – a‘theory of victory’. (Frühling, 2014)
	•	Managing strategic risk over time thus requires matching two streams: one of requirements to meet possible threats, and one of available military capability. (Frühling, 2014)
	•	Managing strategic risks through the defence effort also requires a strategy that explains how the threat or use of armed force reduces strategic risk. This strategy can be precise, focused and detailed to address a specific risk, or broad and general. (Frühling, 2014)
	•	Different situations of strategic risk will require different ways of going about defence planning. Two criteria are particularly important in this regard: the overall confidence with which strategic risks are assessed, and the number of risks that must be managed at the same time. (Frühling, 2014)

Strategic risk characterization
	•	Underlying (intelligence) assessments about the international environment are factual and analytical, summarizing what is known and unknown about strategic circumstances, what is judged probable or more remote. (Frühling, 2014)
	•	But any strategic development is a potential risk only if it might lead to a threat to a valued interest or position, and defining and prioritizing such interests is an essentially political task. (Frühling, 2014)
	•	Characterization of strategic risks depends on professional advice, but its outcome is essentially political in its inherent judgement about what the nationholds dear, and what it is willing to defend. (Frühling, 2014)
	•	Risk characterization is thus an essential part of strategic guidance for the defence organization, at the intersection of political and public service parts of government, and the translation of policy into planning. (Frühling, 2014)
	•	In the characterization of strategic risks, the confidence in the assessment of specific risks – of ‘known knowns’ and ‘known unknowns’, to borrow Donald Rumsfeld’s phrase – is of central importance. (Frühling, 2014)
	•	An important factor in the characterization of strategic risks, which affects the scale of potential risks as well as their certainty of assessment, are judgements about the nature and durability of the current international order. (Frühling, 2014)
Strategic risk reduction
	•	Reducing strategic risk is thus ultimately a task for defence and foreign policy more generally, which provide the context for the potential role of armed force. (Frühling, 2014)
	•	In practice, reducing uncertainty means reducing the potential for, and impactof strategic surprise. (Frühling, 2014)
Strategic risk assessment
	•	The assessment of strategic risks and the development of a strategy both rest on logical inference: from the information that is available in the present, it is necessary to make judgements about what may happen in the future, and what consequences one’s own efforts to manage a risk may have. (Frühling, 2014)

Strategic shock
	•	Strategic shocks, on the other hand, are complex, hyper-surprises. (Freier, 2009)
Unconventional strategic shocks
	•	Unconventional strategic shocks will originate in irregular, catastrophic, and hybrid threats of purpose or context of the type outlined earlier. (Freier, 2009)
Strategist
	•	Ultimately, however, strategists, no less than intelligence analysts, must develop a sharp appreciation for what intelligence can and cannot be expected to provide. They must also rely on their own intellectual abilities and expertise when reaching momentous decisions of war and peace. The success of their policies often depends on how well strategists—not just intelligence analysts—accurately assess, understand, and exploit the international environment in which they are operating. (George, 2004)
	•	The strategist sadly is obliged, faute de mieux, to cope with and for a prospective future that will not reliably reward his rationality and reasonableness. (Gray, 2014)
	•	in life as in warfare, strategists will always prevail over tacticians. (Greene, 2018)
Strategy
	•	Strategy, defence planning, and uncertainty are interdependent in the vital sense that one cannot understand any of them without simultaneously grappling with the meaning and implications of the others. (Gray, 2014)
	•	Strategy is a functional necessity for every human society, since all political communities need a security that must entail endeavour to match political ends with good enough available means employed in tolerably effective ways. (Gray, 2014)
	•	Strategy is exceptionally difficult to do well, and as a consequence many, possibly most, people who attempt to do it do not perform well. (Gray, 2014)
	•	It is the strategy bridge between the interdependent realms of politics and military (inter alia) instrument that is most critical to prudence in defence planning. (Gray, 2014)
	•	Strategy provides the discipline of clear enough categorization of behaviours that are distinctive in nature. (Gray, 2014)
	•	Strategy as an intellectual and a practical matter suffers because of the very inclusivity of domain that should mandate its sovereign relative importance. (Gray, 2014)
	•	Strategy is so inclusive a concept that strategist is endangered as a distinctive species. (Gray, 2014)
	•	a strategy is an idea, often at first quite opaque, and arises from synthesis of information and from creativity, as well as political intercourse. (Frühling, 2014)
	•	All strategies involve mak- ing choices over ends, ways and means. Central to sound strategy is having a clear statement of principles and values to inform the inevitable trade-offs and to highlight what cannot be compromised. (Omand, 2014)

Military strategy
	•	‘Strategy is the employment of the battle to gain the end of the War; it must therefore give an aim to the whole military action . . .’ (Clausewitz, [1832] 1968: 241). (Neumann and Heikka, 2005)
	•	I define Strategics, the science of the movements in war of two armies, out of the visual circle of each other; or, if better liked, out of canon-reach. (Bülow and Martemont, 1806)
	•	The British Ministry of Defense (2011c) has definitions of military strategy but none of risk management strategy, although it defines “risk mitigation” as “reduction of the exposure to, probability of, or loss from risk” (pp. 6-7). (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Strategy is well defined in military contexts. For instance, the United States Department of Defense (DOD) dictionary (2012b) defines it as “a prudent idea or set of ideas for employing the instruments of national power in a synchronized and integrated fashion to achieve theatre, national, and/or multinational objective.”. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Strategy is not the only field where ‘risk’ is redefining the terms of policy-making. (Rasmussen, 2006)
	•	Strategy came into being in the seventeenth century as a way of making sense of guns. (Rasmussen, 2006)
	•	Strategy was to make sense of this ‘revolution in military affairs’ by linking it to the development of the modern state. The new military technologies were to be put to use by the governments of the new sovereign states. (Rasmussen, 2006)
	•	Carl von Clausewitz famously defined warfare as the use of armed force as a means of politics. From this perspective, strategy is the modern idea of what going to war is all about. (Rasmussen, 2006)
	•	Strategy makes sense of the relationship between the technologies by means of which wars are fought, and of the doctrines that define the aims of the campaigns and the nature of the enemies one fights. (Rasmussen, 2006)
	•	In the late eighteenth century the concept of strategy came to define ‘questions of force’ in terms of means-ends rationality. (Rasmussen, 2001)
	•	Strategy was to define ‘war’s conduct as a “science” whose principles could be discovered, laid down in a “system”, and taught in the military academies that were just beginning to open their doors’. (Rasmussen, 2001)
	•	Military strategy is the direction and use made of force and the threat of force for the purposes of policy as decided by politics. (Gray, 2014)
	•	Although strategy usually is understood to stand in a position necessarily subordinate to policy, it is important to appreciate the structure of strategy as encompassing political policy ends, as well as strategic ways, and military means. (Gray, 2014)
	•	Strategy cannot comprise simply a marriage between ways and means: policy purpose is literally essential. (Gray, 2014)
	•	strategy is about politics, not science. (Gray, 2014)
	•	In general, strategy is the link between armed force and political ends. In wartime, this means ‘the useof engagements for the object of the war’, as Clausewitz famously defined it. (Frühling, 2014)
	•	the immediate aim of strategy in wartime, and of strategy in relation to a specific adversary, is to impose one’s will at that particular time. (Frühling, 2014)

Peacekeeping strategy
	•	Peacetime strategy is thus usually aimed at avoiding the materialization of a risk in the first place – throughdeterrence or dissuasion,29 for example, or through peacekeeping and other deployments to strengthen the international order that constrains potential adversaries. (Frühling, 2014)
Security strategy
	•	a security strategy as “the overarching philosophy, application of approaches, and use of resources that frame organization security management” (p. xviii). (Newsome, 2013)
	•	future security strategy must accommodate steadily eroding national capacity and resolve to support current foreign policy. (Mauk, 2010)
Art of strategy
	•	The art of strategy was to engage in a series of successful trade-offs: trading space for time, long-term objectives for short (or those more easily attainable). (Coker, 2009)
	•	Because strategy is an art and not a science that rests upon truths that can be verified by replication in tests in any local context, the political judgement that produces policy ends always is potentially the most fatal of traps for those who take undeserved comfort from the evidence of apparently rational process. (Gray, 2014) 
	•	
Theory of strategy
	•	The general theory of strategy is a rational construction, but it does make signal provision for the relevance of the rational exercise of unreason. Specifically, the theory identifies strategy as being necessarily human and value-charged. The rational architecture of strategic logic, with its interdependent ends, ways, and means—fuelled suitably by shaping and driving assumptions—in historical practice always is occupied and employed by human personalities with beliefs. (Gray, 2014)
	•	Order and meaning is given to the mission of defence planning and its ever changing menu of possible specific tasks, by the theory of strategy. That theory is unique in its ability to explain what is done, why it is done, and why it can be done well or poorly. (Gray, 2014)
	•	The theory of strategy and of international politics is well decorated with words of power; heavy-duty concepts and propositions that, alas, failed to achieve traction when and where they might have made a large benign difference to the course of events. (Gray, 2014)
	•	Strategy is the only bridge built and held to connect policy purposefully with the military and other instruments of power and influence. (Gray, 2014)
	•	Strategy serves politics instrumentally by generating net strategic effect. (Gray, 2014)
	•	Strategy is adversarial; it functions in both peace and war, and it always seeks a measure of control over enemies (and often over allies and neutrals, also). (Gray, 2014)
	•	Strategy usually requires deception, very frequently is ironic, and occasionallyis paradoxical. (Gray, 2014)
	•	Strategy is pervasively human. (Gray, 2014)
	•	The meaning and character of strategies are driven, though not dictated andwholly determined, by their contexts, all of which are constantly in play andcan realistically be understood to constitute just one compound super-context. (Gray, 2014)
	•	Strategy has a permanent nature, while strategies (usually plans, formal or informal, expressing contingent operational intentions) have a variable character, driven but not mandated by their unique and changing contexts, theneeds of which are expressed in the decisions of individuals and institutions. (Gray, 2014)
	•	Strategy typically is made in a process of dialogue and negotiation. (Gray, 2014)
	•	Strategy is a value charged zone of ideas and behaviour. (Gray, 2014)
	•	Historically specific strategies often are driven, and always are shaped, byculture and personality, while strategy in general theory is not. (Gray, 2014)
	•	The strategy bridge must be held by competent strategists. (Gray, 2014)
	•	Strategy is more difficult to devise and execute than are policy, operations, and tactics: friction of all kinds comprise phenomena inseparable from the makingand execution of strategies. (Gray, 2014)
	•	The structure of the strategy function is best explained as comprising politicalends, chosen ways, and enabling means (especially, but not exclusively, military) and the whole endeavour is informed, shaped, and may even be driven by the reigning assumptions, both those that are recognized and those that are not. (Gray, 2014)
	•	Strategy can be expressed in strategies that are: direct or indirect; sequential or cumulative; attritional or manoeuvrist-annihilating; persisting or raiding (more or less expeditionary); or a complex combination of these alternatives. (Gray, 2014)
	•	All strategies are shaped by their particular geographical contexts, but strategy itself is not. (Gray, 2014)
	•	Strategy is an unchanging, indeed unchangeable, human activity in thought and behaviour, set in a variably dynamic technological context. (Gray, 2014)
	•	Unlike strategy, all strategies are temporal. (Gray, 2014)
	•	Strategy is logistical. (Gray, 2014)
	•	Strategic theory is the fundamental source of military doctrine, while doctrineis a notable enabler of, and guide for, strategies. (Gray, 2014)
	•	All military behaviour is tactical in execution, but must have operational and strategic effect, intended and otherwise. (Gray, 2014)
	•	Means usually is the third item in the standard model of strategy, if only because it is the category of behaviour and activity at the lowest level of authority. (Gray, 2014)

Response component of strategy
	•	al effectively with a wide range of contingencies (including wars), and to do so in diverse operational circumstances (Davis, 1994; Ch. 4). This approach is sensi- tive to issues such as Achilles’ heel problems (e.g., dependence on warning and vulnerability to mass-destruction weapons) and so- called “asymmetric strategies” of opponents. (Davis, 2000)
	•	one conclusion from extensive RAND capabilities-based analysis is that U.S. success in mid-term major theater wars would likely depend more on presence and rapid deployment of “high-tech” capabilities than on num- bers of divisions, wings, and battle groups (Davis, Hillestad, and Crawford, 1998; Bennett, Twomey, and Treverton, 1999). (Davis, 2000)
	•	This also has important implications for resource allocation, especially when using resource-allocation methods developed for portfolio-style analysis (Hillestad and Davis, 1998). (Davis, 2000)
Strategic adaptiveness
	•	Strategic adaptiveness is the ability to change military posture quickly and easily over time in response to shifts of geo-strategic environment or national strategy: Quickly enough to meet challenges; Easily in terms of budget and assured effectiveness. (Davis, 2000)
	•	strategic adaptiveness is the ability, quickly and at rea- sonable expense, to adjust to changes in environment over time, Figure 2.6 suggests that many factors contribute—including, perhaps most importantly, a nation’s industrial base and economic health. (Davis, 2000)
	•	strategic adaptiveness has four major com- ponents, corresponding to the ability to adapt to new assessments regarding: (1) the international security environment; (2) military technology; (3) the realities of cost, performance, and organizational behavior; and (4) national priorities as reflected notably in the defense budget and policies regarding degree of engagement. (Davis, 2000)
Strategic agility
	•	‘Strategic agility’ or geographic flexibility is defined by the US Defense Science Board as ‘the ability to rapidly move personnel, materiel, and weapons when and to where they are needed and to maneuver them within the battlespace asrequired’. (Frühling, 2014)
Strategic culture
	•	Strategic worldviews and culture both shape and are shaped by the preference for particular kinds of military power. (Gray, 2014)
	•	Strategic cultural preference reflecting nationally distinctive physical geography appear to be both universal and universally readily explicable. (Gray, 2014)

Strategic decision
	•	strategic decision requires consideration that is pre-eminently political and moral, rather than mathematical. (Gray, 2014)
Strategic mind
	•	The strategic mind insists upon receiving a plausible answer to the most general purpose of default questions, so what? (Gray, 2014)
Strategic notice
	•	Having strategic notice of potential future developments can provide an alert government with the possibility of materially reducing risks to the public, for example through the preparation of contingency plans and policies and through careful preparation of public opinion. (Omand, 2014)
	•	I term strategic notice, where government is being put on notice that there are developments of which it needs to be aware. (Omand, 2014)
	•	Strategic notice in the form simply of a list of conceivable future possibilities is however of only limited use (in the same way as corporate risk registers that are simply a catalogue of all the disasters that might befall are only building-blocks for a sensible risk management process). (Omand, 2014)
Strategic surprise
	•	Reducing reaction time through maintaining high operational readiness can reduce the severity of a possible strategic surprise. (Frühling, 2014)
	•	The possibility of strategic surprise is thus a risk in itself that requires characterization and management. (Frühling, 2014)
	•	strategic surprise literature is part of the Security Studies subfield of Political Science, and consists of analyses of successful military surprise attacks and the reasons for the failure to prevent them. (Marrin, 2004)
	•	As Poteat later notes: ‘‘Strategic surprise is a cognitive problem related to the attitudes, beliefs, and expectations of those responsible for using intelligence. If an intelligence gap exists, it is in the minds of those who use (and misuse) intelligence.’’ (Marrin, 2004)
	•	As Poteat later notes: ‘‘Strategic surprise is a cognitive problem related to the attitudes, beliefs, and expectations of those responsible for using intelligence. If an intelligence gap exists, it is in the minds of those who use (and misuse) intelligence.’’ (Marrin, 2004)
	•	As Poteat later notes: ‘‘Strategic surprise is a cognitive problem related to the attitudes, beliefs, and expectations of those responsible for using intelligence. If an intelligence gap exists, it is in the minds of those who use (and misuse) intelligence.’’ (Marrin, 2004)
	•	It may be impossible to be immune to surprises, and excessive reliance on early warning, especially early warning with respect to intentions, might be considered little more than gambling. (Kahana, 2002)
	•	The most significant surprises—the sorts of events that are sometimes called black swans—are known to military and national security analysts as strategic surprises. (Dahl, 2013)
	•	The term ‘‘strategic surprise’’ is frequently used to indicate the most serious types of surprise attack—those that achieve a ‘‘strategic’’ level of surprise, as opposed to a merely tactical or fleeting surprise. (Dahl, 2013)
	•	Others use the term to suggest a broader category of surprise, such as failures by governments, corporations, militaries, or even individuals to foresee future problems and threats. (Dahl, 2013)
	•	The study of surprise, in fact, has become some- thing of a cottage industry in recent years, with numerous books and articles being published containing advice for how to avoid what are sometimes called ‘‘black swans,’’ ‘‘wild cards,’’ or ‘‘strategic shocks.’’ (Dahl, 2013)
	•	Major insights into intelligence failure have emerged from strategic surprises. (Betts, 2007)
	•	It should count as a strategic surprise in military affairs if the intel- ligence community is unable to give any warning at all of trouble brewing, and a tactical surprise if despite such warning the time, place or nature of the attack still comes as a surprise. (Omand, 2014)
	•	Today, the fear of strategic surprise is a different one. Should neo-jihadist terrorists come to acquire means of significant mass disruption through radiological, chemical or biological means, or worse a proliferating state pass nuclear weapons to such groups, then the strategic significance for the West—and for any sense of security in living in cities of the West— would be immense. (Omand, 2014)
Strange loop
	•	[…] a strange loop involves “a series of stages where a shift occurs from one level of abstraction to another and despite one’s sense of departing ever further from one’s origin, one winds up, to one’s shock, exactly where one had started out” (Hofstadter, 2007, pp. 101-102). (van der Linden, 2016)
Stress
	•	stress increases as resources are lost, threatened, and/or invested without gain. (Gill et al., 2012)
	•	Under stress or any threat, the most primitive parts of the brain are aroused and engaged, overwhelming people’s reasoning powers. In fact, stress or tension can reveal flaws in people that they have carefully concealed from view. It is often wise to observe people in such moments, precisely as a way to judge their true character. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Never imagine that you are someone who can withstand rising stress without emotional leakage. (Greene, 2018)
	•	In everyday life people can often do well at disguising their character flaws, but in times of stress or crisis these flaws can suddenly become very apparent. People under stress lose their normal Self-control. They reveal their insecurities about their reputation, their fear of failure and lack of inner resilience. On the other hand, some people rise to the occasion and reveal strength under fire. There’s no way to tell until the heat is on, but you must pay extra attention to such moments. (Greene, 2018)
Psychological stress
	•	Psychological stress is heightened among individuals and community groups who are vulnerable because of their ties to damaged or threatened resources. (Gill et al., 2012)
Structural unstability
	•	In practice there is an art of ‘tuning’ parameter values. And while nonlinearity requires us to reconsider how we find ‘good parameter values’, chaos will force us to re-evaluate what we mean by ‘good’. A very small difference in the value of a parameter which has an unnoticeable impact on the quality of a short-term forecast can alter the shape of an attractor beyond recognition. Systems in which this happens are called structurally unstable. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
Structure
	•	For Waltz, structure means the ordering principle underlying the way in which the units relate to, and are functionally differentiated from, each other. (Buzan, 1993)
Structured Analytic Techniques
	•	To be sure, a remedy for cognitive bias is better use of what are now generally called Structured Analytic Techniques (SATs). (George, 2010)
	•	Those are specifically designed to uncover hidden cognitive biases and assumptions, as well as highlight intelligence gaps and alternative hypotheses for what analysts are observing. (George, 2010)
	•	Structured analytic techniques are just that – processes for reviewing assumptions, data, and hypotheses. (George, 2010)
	•	SATs cannot fully replicate the experiences and decisionmaking styles used by foreign leaders, which are often at the core of intelligence questions addressed by the CIA and the IC. (George, 2010)
	•	SATs can reveal to critics in other offices, agencies, or policy shops the how and why of analytic judgments on an intelligence question. (George, 2010)
	•	Because there are many different kinds of analytical problems, there are also many different ways to structure analysis. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	An intelligence analyst might make lists of relevant variables, early warning indicators, alternative explanations, possible outcomes, factors a foreign leader will need to take into account when making a decision, or arguments for and against a given explanation or outcome. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Other tools for structuring a problem include outlines, tables, diagrams, trees, and matrices, with many sub-species of each. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Many structured analytical techniques can be conducted on paper. Heuer and Pherson (2010) provide a detailed catalogue of techniques. As in any toolkit, there are methods that are easy to use (e.g. creating simple matrices) and methods that take practice to do well (e.g. Concept Mapping; see, for example, Moon et al. 2010). (Hoffman et al., 2011)
	•	According to Heuer (1999, see also Heuer and Pherson 2010) the following activities can be structured and thereby insure the soundness of critical thinking: Recognising and clearly delineating assumptions and chains of inference, Determining and specifying uncertainty, Determining and specifying the diagnosticity of evidence, Disconfirmatory reasoning, pitting competing hypotheses against the evidence, Considering alternative interpretations and (re)consideration of evidence that might be ignored on the basis of mind-set, Analysis of multiple alternative and competing hypotheses, Enhancing analysts’ metacognitive awareness and understanding of their own thinking, ‘What-if ’ reasoning. (Hoffman et al., 2011)
	•	While there is certainly value and utility to systematically laying out problems, say in the form of a matrix and associated likelihoods, one might be wary of going from this to a system that forces a reasoner to become a probability-juggler. (Hoffman et al., 2011)
	•	The sensemaking approach to critical thinking and intelligence analysis leverages our methods of cognitive field research and our understanding of expertise (Moore 2011). It can be thought of as complementary to the structured analysis approach, which focuses on helping less experienced analysts overcome reasoning traps and biases. This complementarity is described in Table 1. (Hoffman et al., 2011)
	•	Past experience shows that it is exceedingly difficult to avoid premature closure and “groupthink” unless the analyst employs a specific tool or technique. Simply sensitizing analysts to the variety of analytic traps they are most likely to encounter rarely prevents them from falling into those traps. (Pherson, 2009)
	•	Warning analysts can reduce the chances of main-line analysts and policymakers being surprised by future events if they employ structured analytic techniques. (Pherson, 2009)
	•	The techniques they employ should help analysts: Challenge key assumptions. Generate multiple hypotheses. Discover “unknown unknowns.” Track alternative future trajectories. Anticipate the unanticipated. (Pherson, 2009)
	•	None of these structured analytic techniques guarantee that all analysts will foresee unanticipated events in enough time to provide adequate warning. (Pherson, 2009)
	•	Intelligence surprises are inevitable, but use of these techniques will ensure greater rigor in the analysis and reduce the chances of surprise. (Pherson, 2009)
	•	If analysts continually test, probe, and indeed attack their assumptions and mindsets, they will be more capable of knowing what they know and discovering what they actually did not know. (Pherson, 2009)
	•	Use of these techniques helps warning analysts anticipate what might occur in the future and better prepare themselves to track developments that presage dramatic change. In the end, decisionmakers will benefit from the more thoughtful, comprehensive analysis that results from employing these techniques. (Pherson, 2009)
	•	The actual cognitive processes required to produce intelligence analysis are not very well understood despite the half-century or more in which intelligence analysis has been practiced. Historically, intelligence analysis has been more of a trade informed by past practice than a profession with established standards and qualifications. Today a number of different “how to” guides exist for producing intelligence analysis, and their existence is at least partially attributable to CIA’s progress in understanding and improving the analytic process. (Marrin, 2002)
	•	Analysts tend to have a two-step analytic approach. They use intuitive “pattern and trend analysis” – consisting of the identification of repeated behavior over time and increases or decreases in that behavior – to uncover changes in some aspect of international behavior that could have national security implications.39 Once patterns are detected, they rely on ad hoc rules derived from study in relevant theory – for example, economics, political science, or psychology – to determine the significance of the pattern. (Marrin, 2002)
	•	likelihood of surprise by uncovering analytical mind-sets and sensitizing policymakers to the inherent uncertainty surrounding major international developments that they confront each day. (George, 2004)
	•	Ironically, the CIA’s impressive record of developing sophisticated analytical methodologies to understand closed societies and complex international trends has not been able to overcome the fundamental challenge of eliminating these human cognitive blinders to unexpected events. Despite the efforts of Kent and others, as the Cold War drew to a close, senior intelligence managers became more aware of their discipline’s weak intellectual underpinnings. (George, 2004)
	•	The most powerful techniques include: Key Assumptions Checks, Devil’s Advocacy, Team A= Team B, Red Cell exercises, Contingency ‘‘What If’’ Analysis, High Impact/Low Probability analysis, and Scenario Development. Similarities and overlap are present in some of these techniques, and most are designed to highlight uncertainty and identify intelligence collection gaps. (George, 2004)
	•	some of these techniques turn out to be of most benefit to those who use them. (George, 2004)
	•	Like traditional analysis, intelligence sense-making suffers from the effects
of mental biases. The process of challenging assumptions in this domain will be different, however, from that used in the more familiar analytic domain. (Fishbein and Treverton, 2004)
	•	Systematic use of the wide array of divergent thinking techniques as a precursor to the preparation of intelligence products would help to put a wide range of possibilities on the table before provisional intellectual closure was reached. (Fishbein and Treverton, 2004)
	•	A conscious mixing of mental biases would also help to assure that different types of “eyes” are searching for threatening patterns. (Fishbein and Treverton, 2004)
	•	Intelligence analysts need to focus on patterns that are different, even contradictory to those they expect, to lessen the degree to which their mental models inhibit their ability to perceive new information. And they must do so fairly regularly to promote continuous awareness of possibilities. (Fishbein and Treverton, 2004)
	•	These structured analytic techniques can be used in a variety of ways when analysts begin a new assessment. Some can be used equally effectively at multiple points in the process and can promote an analyst’s ability to keep an open mind, to consider multiple—including highly unlikely—hypotheses, to challenge conventional wisdom, and to assess the impact of important information gaps or deception on analytic judgments and confidence levels. (US Government, 2009)
	•	Using the analytic techniques contained in this primer will assist analysts in dealing with the perennial problems of intelligence: the complexity of international developments, incomplete and ambiguous information, and the inherent limitations of the human mind. (US Government, 2009)
	•	A systematic approach that considers a range of alternative explanations and outcomes offers one way to ensure that analysts do not dismiss potentially relevant hypotheses and supporting information resulting in missed opportunities to warn. (US Government, 2009)
	•	Cognitive and perceptual biases in human perception and judgment are another important reason for analysts to consider alternatives. (US Government, 2009)
	•	The techniques found in this primer are designed to assist in this regard by: Instilling more structure into the intelligence analysis. Making analytic arguments more transparent by articulating them and challenging key assumptions. Stimulating more creative, “out-of-the-box” thinking and examining alternative outcomes, even those with low probability, to see if available data might support these outcomes. Identifying indicators of change (or signposts) that can reduce the chances of surprise. (US Government, 2009)
	•	The techniques are grouped by their purpose: diagnostic techniques are primarily aimed at making analytic arguments, assumptions, or intelligence gaps more transparent; contrarian techniques explicitly challenge current thinking; and imaginative thinking techniques aim at developing new insights, different perspectives and/or develop alternative outcomes. (US Government, 2009)
	•	analysts will want to select the tool that best accomplishes the specific task they set out for themselves. Although application of these techniques alone is no guarantee of analytic precision or accuracy of judgments, it does improve the sophistication and credibility of intelligence assessments as well as their usefulness to policymakers. (US Government, 2009)
	•	Analytical strategies are important because they influence the data one attends to. They determine where the analyst shines his or her searchlight, and this inevitably affects the outcome of the analytical process. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Minds are like parachutes. They only function when they are open. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	These techniques break your existing mind-set by causing you to play a different and unaccustomed role. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	contribute to mitigating the cognitive limitations. (Heuer, 2008)
	•	Bias can be minimized, however, by enforcing rigorous standards of evidence and comparison, and the effects of bias can be mitigated or made productive by organizing the confrontation of views in as systematic a manner as possible. (Betts, 2007)
	•	The Intelligence Community (IC) has developed many devices to attack the problem of unexpected surprises, including the use of ‘‘red teams’’ to attack the assumptions underlying conventional analysis. (Weiss, 2008)
	•	The Intelligence Community (IC) is strongly emphasizing the use of structured analytic techniques (SATs) to promote rigorous analysis, lessen the risk of intelligence failure, and make analysts’ reasoning more transparent to consumers. (Artner et al., 2016)
	•	SATs are improving the quality of analysis. (Artner et al., 2016)
	•	SATs provide analysts with clear, often step-by-step, guid- ance for conducting analysis of intelligence issues. By providing greater structure to the analytic process, they reduce subjectiv- ity and add both rigor and transparency to analysis. A key part of reducing subjectivity in analysis requires identifying cognitive bias and reducing it. (Artner et al., 2016)
	•	, which are often seen as efforts to disrupt the consensus the other members desire. (Artner et al., 2016)
	•	SATs also provide step-by-step guidance for designing analysis to address particular kinds of problems. They make analysis much more transparent, so that other analysts and customers can better understand how the judgments were reached. (Artner et al., 2016)
	•	SATs also facilitate group involvement in analysis because multiple analysts can use these techniques collaboratively on difficult problems and, in the process, help reduce potential biasing effects of individual analysts while highlighting the bases for analytic agreement and disagreement. (Artner et al., 2016)
	•	SATs help analysts evaluate how much confidence they should have in particular judgments, and some can even help in estimating rough likelihoods that some event or outcome may or may not occur. Use of SATs also supports and helps to implement the important analytic and tradecraft standards. (Artner et al., 2016)
	•	Structured analytic techniques (SATs) are intended to improve intelligence analysis by checking the two canonical sources of error: systematic biases and random noise. (Chang et al., 2018)
Alternative Analysis
	•	Alternative Analysis (AA) seeks to impose an explicit self-review by using specific techniques to reveal unconscious analytical assumptions or challenge weak evidence or logic, and consider alternative hypotheses or outcomes, even in the absence of convincing evidence. (George, 2004)
	•	Simply put, intelligence analysts are now obliged to question explicitly and rigorously the assumptions that underlie their conclusions, and guard against conventional wisdom masking a fundamental change in the dynamics of an issue. (George, 2004)
	•	In many ways, AA merely builds upon the earlier Tradecraft 2000 emphasis that encouraged analysts to identify linchpin assumptions, key drivers, indicators, and triggers to future events. Unlike Tradecraft 2000. (George, 2004)
	•	 AA seeks to display this analytical self-review to the policymaker and not merely to use it as an in-house critique. (George, 2004)
	•	These Alternative Analysis techniques—in addition to other more specialized gaming and simulation techniques—have been put to use in current publications when senior intelligence officials believed that going beyond conventional intelligence judgments was appropriate. (George, 2004)
	•	consistent with the renewed emphasis on communicating the limitations of intelligence products to its customers, policymakers and senior military officials should be aware of some important limitations in the use of AA. The challenges of presenting Alternative Analysis to senior policymakers are almost as great as are the dangers of not using it at all. (George, 2004)
	•	some policymakers continue to prefer precise, single-point judgments from intelligence analysts; to these decisionmakers, the DI’s resorting to ‘‘what if ’’ or contrarian analysis undermines their confidence in what the CIA or other IC analysts are telling them. (George, 2004)
	•	The second pitfall to using AA techniques is that some of its methodologies are arcane. A ‘‘key assumptions’’ check assumes that the reader has a fairly sophisticated grasp of an issue. The decision to use AA or other techniques will always rest on the Agency’s knowing the customers, their level of knowledge, and their interest in having the CIA challenge their thinking on a vital issue. (George, 2004)
	•	Naturally, there always will be senior policymakers who are not experts in their own right and will wonder why CIA is questioning its own analysis of a critical issue. Moreover, unless policymakers have actually been through a scenario development exercise, they probably will not understand the process by which the scenarios were developed. Very few have the luxury of participating in the lengthy workshops that scenario exercises often require. (George, 2004)
	•	using Alternative Analysis will create friction within analytical ranks if there is a well-accepted view of important intelligence issues. Trying to argue against the current analytical line can be seen as undermining teamwork or even a sign of personal self-promotion. Hence, unless there is higher-level receptivity to AA, the analyst eager to try out Devil’s Advocacy or other contrarian techniques against an analytical unit’s conventional wisdom could face considerable resistance, if not open hostility. (George, 2004)
	•	Alternative Analysis can be resource intensive. (George, 2004)
	•	To proselytize the use of AA everywhere and everyday is unrealistic, and a poor use of scarce analytical resources. As a rule, intelligence managers will have to be convinced that: (1) the issue is sufficiently important to justify using these techniques; (2) the consequences of being wrong would be a major surprise to the U.S. intelligence and policy communities; and (3) the use of the techniques will raise a policymaker’s understanding of the issue and the uncertainties surrounding it. Similarly, good judgment is required in deciding when to present Alternative Analysis to a policymaker. (George, 2004)
	•	Contrarian analysis can be downright irritating to the policymaking community after it has completed a major policy review and selected a course of action; had this same analysis been presented a few months earlier, however, it might have been well received and helpful in stimulating and raising the level of the policy debate. (George, 2004)
	•	The CIA is using Alternative Analysis more explicitly to challenge its analyses, raise important questions to policymakers, and reduce their susceptibility to surprise. (George, 2004)
	•	Analysis of alternatives is the systematic evaluation of differing hypotheses to explain events or phenomena, explore near-term outcomes, and imagine possible futures to mitigate surprise and risk. Analytic products should identify and assess plausible alternative hypotheses. This is particularly important when major judgments must contend with significant uncertainties, or complexity (e.g., forecasting future trends), or when low probability events could produce high-impact results. In discussing alternatives, products should address factors such as associated assumptions, likelihood, or implications related to U.S. interests. Products also should identity indicators that, if detected, would affect the likelihood of identified alternatives. (DNI, 2007)
	•	Traditional intelligence analysis generates forecasts or explanations based on logical processing of available evidence, whereas alternative analysis seeks to help analysts and policy-makers stretch their thinking through structured techniques that challenge underlying assumptions and broaden the range of possible outcomes considered. Properly applied, it serves as a hedge against the natural tendencies of analysts—like all human beings—to perceive information selectively through the lens of preconceptions, to search too narrowly for facts that would confirm rather than discredit existing hypotheses, and to be unduly influenced by premature consensus within analytic groups close at hand. (Fishbein and Treverton, 2004)
	•	Alternative analysis involves a fairly intensive, though time limited, effort to challenge assumptions or to identify alternative outcomes, depending on the technique employed, with the results captured, implicitly or explicitly, in a written product delivered to relevant policy-makers. (Fishbein and Treverton, 2004)
	•	alternative analysis techniques can help to reduce the likelihood of “intelligence failures,” which historically have stemmed in part from such mental errors (e.g. the ingrained belief that the Japanese could not mount a successful attack against Pearl Harbor). (Fishbein and Treverton, 2004)
	•	alternative analysis has not been particularly effective within the Intelligence Community as it has been employed only sporadically, at best, and more often than not as a “nice to have” supplement tacked on to traditional analysis rather than integrated at the outset as an essential component of the analytic enterprise in a world of uncertainty and deception. (Fishbein and Treverton, 2004)
	•	Alternative analysis tools can support the overall analytic process by ensuring that more than one explanatory hypothesis or projected outcome is seriously considered. (Fishbein and Treverton, 2004)
	•	alternative analysis enhances a formal, periodic process for exploring a limited range of outcomes. (Fishbein and Treverton, 2004)
	•	identify an issue too important to “afford getting it wrong” and then challenge assumptions and identify alternative outcomes. (Fishbein and Treverton, 2004)
	•	Traditional alternative analysis is a fairly formal process with some elements of creativity but with a strong emphasis on logical argument to come to clear conclusions. (Fishbein and Treverton, 2004)
	•	Although many forms of traditional alternative analysis are collaborative, an individual analyst can do others, like devil’s advocacy or “what- if” analysis. (Fishbein and Treverton, 2004)
Alternative sense-making 
	•	“alternative sense-making” must address a process that is informal, continuous, and focused on issues marked by very high uncertainty. (Fishbein and Treverton, 2004)
	•	Alternative “sense-making” for complex issues would, by contrast, be more freewheeling and creative. (Fishbein and Treverton, 2004)
	•	To the extent that alternative sense-making can help to suspend premature judgment and make an array of possibilities come alive, it may head off “failures of imagination” by stimulating exploration of alternative dot arrangements. (Fishbein and Treverton, 2004)

	•	Brainstorming is a widely used technique for stimulating new thinking and it can be applied to virtually all of the other structured analysis techniques as an aid to thinking. Typically, analytic will brainstorm when they begin a project to help generate a range of hypotheses about their issue. (US Government, 2009)
	•	Brainstorming, almost by definition, involves a group of analysts meeting to discuss a common challenge; a modest investment of time at the beginning or critical points of a project can take advantage of their different perspectives to help structure a problem. This group process allows others to build on an initial idea suggested by a member of the brainstorming session. (US Government, 2009)
	•	This technique can maximize creativity in the thinking process, force analysts to step outside their normal analytic mind-sets, and suspend their typical “good judgment” about the practicality of ideas or approaches. (US Government, 2009)
	•	brainstorming allows analysts to see a wider range of factors that might bear on the topic than they would otherwise consider. (US Government, 2009)
	•	Brainstorming gives permission to think more radically or “outside the box.” In particular, it can spark new ideas, ensure a comprehensive look at a problem or issues, raise unknowns, and prevent premature consensus around a single hypothesis. (US Government, 2009)
	•	Paradoxically, brainstorming should be a very structured process to be most productive. An unconstrained, informal discussion might produce some interesting ideas, but usually a more systematic process is the most effective way to break down mind-sets and produce new insights. (US Government, 2009)
	•	the process involves a divergent thinking phase to generate and collect new ideas and insights, followed by a convergent phase in which ideas are grouped and organized around key concepts. (US Government, 2009)
	•	Some of the simple rules to be followed include: Never censor an analyst’s ideas no matter how unconventional they might sound. Rather find out what prompted the thought, as it might contain the seeds of an important connection between the topic and an unstated assumption. Give yourself enough time to do brainstorming correctly. It usually takes one hour to set the “rules” of the game, get the group comfortable, and exhaust the conventional wisdom on the topic. Only then will the truly creative ideas begin to emerge. Involve at least one “outsider” in the process—that is, someone who does not share the same educational background, culture, technical knowledge or mind- set as the core group but has some familiarity with the topic. (US Government, 2009)
	•	A two-phase, twelve-step, structured process is often used to get the most out of the brainstorming sessions: Divergent Thinking Phase: Distribute “Post-It” notes and pens or markers to all participants. Typically, 10-12 people works best. Pose the problem in terms of a “focal question.” Display it in one sentence on a large easel or whiteboard. Ask the group to write down responses to the question, using key words that will fit on the small “Post-It” note. Stick all the notes on a wall for all to see—treat all ideas the same. When a pause follows the initial flow of ideas, the group is reaching the end of their conventional thinking and the new divergent ideas are then likely to emerge. End the “collection stage” of the brainstorming after two or three pauses. Convergent Thinking Phase: Ask the participants as a group to rearrange the notes on the wall according to their commonalities or similar concepts. No talking is permitted. Some notes may be moved several times as notes begin to cluster. Copying some notes is permitted to allow ideas to be included in more than one group. Select a word or phrase that characterizes each grouping or cluster once all the notes have been arranged. Identify any notes that do not easily fit with others and consider them either useless noise or the beginning of an idea that deserves further attention. Assess what the group has accomplished in terms of new ideas or concepts identified or new areas that need more work or further brainstorming. Instruct each participant to select one or two areas that deserve the most attention. Tabulate the votes. Set the brainstorming group’s priorities based on the voting and decide on the next steps for analysis. (US Government, 2009)
	•	a group discussion process used for generating new ideas and concepts often used to kickoff analysis of especially complex or controversial issues. (Artner et al., 2016)
Challenging Key Assumptions
	•	Two techniques have proven particularly effective in helping analysts identify and challenge the very foundations of their analysis: the Key Assumptions Check and Quadrant Crunching. (Pherson, 2009)
Devil’s Advocate
	•	As a possibly extreme type of alternative analysis, a Devil’s Advocate would entail a challenge to the prevailing analytical judgment. Whether institutionalized or assigned on an ad hoc basis, the role of the Devil’s Advocate would be to build a case—using primarily the same evidence, with different assumptions—that the respective analytical component would, but coming to an opposing judgment. (Marrin, 2004)
	•	many observers have recommended institutionalizing dissent by assigning to someone the job of articulating apparently ridiculous interpretations to ensure that they are forced into consideration. (Betts, 2007)
	•	The devil’s advocate is likely to be dismissed by deci- sion makers as a sophist who makes an argument only because he is supposed to, not because of its real merits. Institutionalizing devil’s advocacy is likely to be perceived in practice as institutionalizing the cry wolf problem; “there are limits to the utility of a ‘devil’s advocate’ who is not a true devil.” (Betts, 2007)
	•	If the role is routinized, and thus ritualized, it loses impact; if it is not, there can be no assurance that it will be operating when it is needed. (Betts, 2007)
	•	Another variant would be the intermittent designation of devil’s advocates in periods of crisis, when the possibility of disaster is greater than usual. (Betts, 2007)
	•	This technique is most valuable for challenging a deeply ingrained view of an issue. When confidence in an important, perhaps war-or-peace, judgment is high, the use of such contrarian analysis can be more than justified. To be sure, making such a case sometimes involves a contrived argument that selectively uses information to challenge the conventional wisdom. The art of devil’s advocacy is to turn accepted linchpin assumptions and key drivers on their heads. (George, 2004)
	•	the reality is that most devil’s advocacy proves to be unpersuasive. Still, the exercise has value in raising confidence levels in, and perhaps refining, the prevailing analytic judgment. But its chief drawback is that contrived advocacy can be too easily dismissed if senior intelligence officials and policymakers do not put much credence in the technique. (George, 2004)
	•	the value of Devil’s Advocacy is primarily its challenging the weaker assumptions or evidentiary base of a current intelligence judgment. Since most of this contrarian analysis will be proven wrong, and reaffirm the conventional wisdom rather than replace it, there is little value in publishing it. (George, 2004)
	•	 Only when Devil’s Advocacy is judged useful to provoke a dialogue between policymakers and intelligence analysts would it serve the DI’s interest in disseminating such analysis. (George, 2004)
	•	In the end, most of the learning occurs during the process of using unconventional analytical techniques. The reported findings are not always judged as insightful as the critical thinking that went into the process. (George, 2004)
	•	Challenging a single, strongly held view or consensus by building the best possible case for an alternative explanation. (US Government, 2009)
	•	Devil’s Advocacy is most effective when used to challenge an analytic consensus or a key assumption regarding a critically important intelligence question. (US Government, 2009)
	•	On those issues that one cannot afford to get wrong, Devil’s Advocacy can provide further confidence that the current analytic line will hold up to close scrutiny. An individual analyst can often assume the role of the Devil’s Advocate if he or she has some doubts about a widely held view, or a manager might designate a courageous analyst to challenge the prevailing wisdom in order to reaffirm the group’s confidence in those judgments. (US Government, 2009)
	•	In some cases, the analyst or a team can review a key assumption of a critical judgment in the course of their work, or more likely, a separate analytic product can be generated that arrays all the arguments and data that support a contrary hypothesis. While this can involve some analytic time and effort, when a group of analysts have worked on an issue for a long period of time, it is probably wise to assume that a strong mind-set exists that deserves the closer scrutiny provided by Devil’s Advocacy. (US Government, 2009)
	•	Analysts have an obligation to policymakers to understand where their own analytic judgments might be weak and open to future challenge. Hence, the Devil’s Advocacy process can highlight weaknesses in a current analytic judgment or alternatively help to reaffirm one’s confidence in the prevailing judgments by: Explicitly challenging key assumptions to see if they will not hold up under some circumstances. Identifying any faulty logic or information that would undermine the key analytic judgments. Presenting alternative hypotheses that would explain the current body of information available to analysts. (US Government, 2009)
	•	Its primary value is to serve as a check on a dominant mind-set that can develop over time among even the best analysts who have followed an issue and formed strong consensus that there is only one way of looking at their issue. This mind- set phenomenon makes it more likely that contradictory evidence is dismissed or not given proper weight or consideration. (US Government, 2009)
	•	To challenge the prevailing analytic line, the Devil’s Advocate must: Outline the mainline judgment and key assumptions and characterize the evidence supporting that current analytic view. Select one or more assumptions—stated or not—that appear the most susceptible to challenge. Review the information used to determine whether any is of questionable validity, whether deception is possibly indicated, or whether major gaps exist. Highlight the evidence that could support an alternative hypothesis or contradicts the current thinking. Present to the group the findings that demonstrate there are flawed assumptions, poor quality evidence, or possible deception at work. Consider drafting a separate contrarian paper that lays out the arguments for a different analytic conclusion if the review uncovers major analytic flaws. Be sure that any products generated clearly lay out the conventional wisdom and are identified as an explicitly “Devil’s Advocate” project; otherwise, the reader can become confused as to the current official view on the issue. (US Government, 2009)
	•	the purpose is to challenge a single dominant mind set. (US Government, 2009)
	•	A devil’s advocate is someone who defends a minority point of view. He or she may not necessarily agree with that view, but may choose or be assigned to represent it as strenuously as possible. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	The goal is to expose conflicting interpretations and show how alterna- tive assumptions and images make the world look different. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	It often requires time, energy, and commitment to see how the world looks from a different perspective. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	An alternative or supplementary approach would be to name an individual or small group as a devil’s advocate assigned to develop actual plans for launching such an attack. The assignment to think like a terrorist liberates the designated person(s) to think unconventionally and be less inhibited about finding weaknesses in the system that might embarrass colleagues, because un- covering any such weaknesses is the assigned task. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Devil’s advocacy has a controversial history in the Intelligence Community. Suffice it to say that some competition between conflicting views is healthy and must be encouraged; all-out political battle is counterproductive. (Heuer, 1999)
Key Assumptions Check 
	•	Key Assumptions Checksii have been incorporated into National Intelligence Estimates for decades, but only in recent years has the technique gained wider acceptance across the Intelligence Community. (Pherson, 2009)
	•	All that the technique requires is that the analyst─or the analytic team─write down the key assumptions that underlie the analysis. The process of literally writing down one’s Key Assumptions (or listing them on a whiteboard) forces analysts to think critically about what they assume to be true. Most assumptions will stand up to challenge but, invariably, a few start to fall apart. Those assumptions often become Key Uncertainties rather than Key Assumptions. (Pherson, 2009)
	•	The author’s experience in conducting Key Assumptions Check exercises over the past decade suggests that usually one in four key assumptions, initially presumed to be true, turns out on closer examination to be unfounded. (Pherson, 2009)
	•	A sound understanding of the assumptions underlying an analytic judgment sets the limits for the confidence the analyst ought to have in that judgment. The probability that the judgment is accurate cannot be greater than the probability of the accuracy of the weakest assumption. (Pherson, 2009)
	•	Another advantage of this technique is that the process forces the analyst to consider under what circumstances an assumption might not hold up, thereby sensitizing him or her to data that might otherwise have been ignored. (Pherson, 2009)
	•	When drafting important analysis that contains far-reaching conclusions, analysts must identify key ‘‘linchpin assumptions’’ as well as key ‘‘drivers’’ or factors that shape these assumptions. By explicitly citing the assumptions and drivers, analysts can test the validity of the relationships between the two. (George, 2004)
	•	For example, analysis may conclude that a foreign government is likely to introduce painful economic reforms without creating major instability. In this case, the analyst might need to identify as a key assumption that ‘‘security forces will remain loyal and be willing to use lethal force to maintain order.’’ Should that assumption not hold, or if signs of dissatisfaction should emerge within the security services, then perhaps the analyst’s judgment that the leadership will impose reforms will become less well-founded. (George, 2004)
	•	By making a list of critical assumptions and drivers transparent, analysts allow the policymaker to see the argumentation behind the key conclusion, consider whether the assumptions are valid, and understand what evidence might then lead analysts to alter their judgments. (George, 2004)
	•	A Key Assumptions Check is most useful at the beginning of an analytic project. An individual analyst or a team can spend an hour or two articulating and reviewing the key assumptions. (US Government, 2009)
	•	Rechecking assumptions also can be valuable at any time prior to finalizing judgments, to insure that the assessment does not rest on flawed premises. Identifying hidden assumptions can be one of the most difficult challenges an analyst faces, as they are ideas held—often unconsciously—to be true and, therefore, are seldom examined and almost never challenged. (US Government, 2009)
	•	A key assumption is any hypothesis that analysts have accepted to be true and which forms the basis of the assessment. (US Government, 2009)
	•	All of these examples highlight the fact that analysts often rely on stated and unstated assumptions to conduct their analysis. The goal is not to undermine or abandon key assumptions; rather, it is to make them explicit and identify what information or developments would demand rethinking them. (US Government, 2009)
	•	Explicitly identifying working assumptions during an analytic project helps: Explain the logic of the analytic argument and expose faulty logic. Understand the key factors that shape an issue. Stimulate thinking about an issue. Uncover hidden relationships and links between key factors. Identify developments that would cause you to abandon an assumption. Prepare analysts for changed circumstances that could surprise them. (US Government, 2009)
	•	Checking for key assumptions requires analysts to consider how their analysis depends on the validity of certain premises, which they do not routinely question or believe to be in doubt. (US Government, 2009)
	•	A four- step process will help analysts: 1. Review what the current analytic line on this issue appears to be; write it down for all to see. 2. Articulate all the premises, both stated and unstated in finished intelligence, which are accepted as true for this analytic line to be valid. 3. Challenge each assumption, asking why it “must” be true and whether it remains valid under all conditions. 4. Refine the list of key assumptions to contain only those that “must be true” to sustain your analytic line; consider under what conditions or in the face of what information these assumptions might not hold. (US Government, 2009)
	•	QUESTIONS TO ASK DURING THIS PROCESS INCLUDE: How much confidence exists that this assumption is correct? What explains the degree of confidence in the assumption? What circumstances or information might undermine this assumption? Is a key assumption more likely a key uncertainty or key factor? Could the assumption have been true in the past but less so now? If the assumption proves to be wrong, would it significantly alter the analytic line? How? Has this process identified new factors that need further analysis? (US Government, 2009)
	•	a systematic effort to make explicit and question the assumptions that guide an analyst’s interpretation of evidence and reasoning about any particular problem. (Artner et al., 2016)
Quadrant Crunching
	•	Warning analysts have found Quadrant Crunching, described by some as a Key Assumptions Check “on steroids,” an efficient and effective way to generate a broad set of alternatives when faced with little data and high degrees of uncertainty. (Pherson, 2009)
	•	This group process for identifying and examining all possible combinations of selected key variables helps analysts systematically challenge assumptions, explore the implications of contrary assumptions, and discover “unknown unknowns.” (Pherson, 2009)
	•	By generating multiple potential outcomes for any situation, it greatly reduces the chance that events could play out in previously unimagined ways. (Pherson, 2009)
	•	The Quadrant Crunching technique is particularly beneficial to military analysts because it helps analysts think through how an attack would be launched, what the most likely targets would be, and what signposts or indicators would suggest that a specific attack is in the early stages of implementation. As a result, analysts, policymakers, and military decisionmakers can set priorities and generate specific sets of field requirements in response to highly ambiguous threats. (Pherson, 2009)
Multiple Hypothesis Generation 
	•	A hypothesis is a potential explanation or conclusion that is to be tested by collecting and presenting evidence. It is a declarative statement that has not been established as true─an “educated guess” based on observation to be supported or refuted by more observation or through experimentation. Gaining confidence in a hypothesis is not a function solely of accumulating evidence in its favor, but also in showing that situations that could establish its falsity do not, in fact, happen. (Pherson, 2009)
	•	Multiple Hypothesis Generation is a technique for developing multiple alternatives for explaining a particular issue, activity, or behavior. (Pherson, 2009)
	•	Analysts should develop multiple hypotheses at the start of a project when there is a high level of uncertainty about the outcome; many factors are involved in the analysis; or there are strongly held, competing views amongst analysts or decisionmakers. (Pherson, 2009)
Analysis of Competing Hypotheses
	•	Analysis of Competing Hypotheses is a tool to aid judgment on issues requiring careful weighing of alternative explanations or estimates. (Pherson, 2009)
	•	ACH involves the identification of a complete set of alternative explanations or outcomes (presented as hypotheses), the systematic evaluation of each, and the selection of the one that best fits the evidence. The analysis proceeds by trying to refute rather than to confirm each of the hypotheses. (Pherson, 2009)
	•	ACH is appropriate for almost any analysis in which there are alternative explanations for what has happened, is happening, or is likely to happen. (Pherson, 2009)
	•	ACH is especially effective when there is a robust flow of data to absorb and evaluate. For example, it is well-suited for dealing with technical issues in the chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) arena. It can be used to address questions such as: “What weapons system is this part most likely being imported for?” or “Which type of missile system is Country X importing or developing?”. (Pherson, 2009)
	•	ACH also is particularly helpful when an analyst must deal with the potential for denial and deception. (Pherson, 2009)
	•	ACH helps analysts overcome two common cognitive traps that often lead to intelligence failures: Being overly influenced by a first impression based on incomplete data, an existing analytic line, or a single explanation ; Relying on evidence that supports one’s favored hypothesis but that also happens to be consistent with alternative hypotheses and, therefore, has no diagnostic value in assessing the relative likelihood of the hypotheses. (Pherson, 2009)
	•	Analysis of Competing Hypotheses (ACH) has proved to be a highly effective technique when there is a large amount of data to absorb and evaluate. While a single analyst can use ACH, it is most effective with a small team that can challenge each other’s evaluation of the evidence. (US Government, 2009)
	•	Developing a matrix of hypotheses and loading already collected information into the matrix can be accomplished in a day or less. (US Government, 2009)
	•	If the data must be reassembled, the initial phases of the ACH process may require additional time. (US Government, 2009)
	•	Sometimes a facilitator or someone familiar with the technique can lead new analysts through this process for the first time. (US Government, 2009)
	•	ACH is particularly appropriate for controversial issues when analysts want to develop a clear record that shows what theories they have considered and how they arrived at their judgments. (US Government, 2009)
	•	Developing the ACH matrix allows other analysts (or even policymakers) to review their analysis and identify areas of agreement and disagreement. (US Government, 2009)
	•	Evidence can also be examined more systematically, and analysts have found that this makes the technique ideal for considering the possibility of deception and denial. (US Government, 2009)
	•	ACH helps analysts overcome three common mistakes that can lead to inaccurate forecasts: Analysts often are susceptible to being unduly influenced by a first impression, based on incomplete data, an existing analytic line, or a single explanation that seems to fit well enough. Analysts seldom generate a full set of explanations or hypotheses at the outset of a project. Analysts often rely on evidence to support their preferred hypothesis, but which also is consistent with other explanations. (US Government, 2009)
	•	ACH helps analysts to avoid picking the first solution that seems satisfactory instead of going through all the possibilities to arrive at the very best solution. (US Government, 2009)
	•	ACH demands that analysts explicitly identify all the reasonable alternative hypotheses, then array the evidence against each hypothesis—rather than evaluating the plausibility of each hypothesis one at a time. To create a level playing field, the process must: Ensure that all the information and argumentation is evaluated and given equal treatment or weight when considering each hypothesis. Prevent the analyst from premature closure on a particular explanation or hypothesis. Protect the analyst against innate tendencies to ignore or discount information that does not fit comfortably with the preferred explanation at the time. (US Government, 2009)
	•	To accomplish this, the process should follow these steps: Brainstorm among analysts with different perspectives to identify all possible hypotheses. List all significant evidence and arguments relevant to all the hypotheses. Prepare a matrix with hypotheses across the top and each piece of evidence on the side. Determine whether each piece of evidence is consistent, inconsistent, or not applicable to each hypothesis. Refine the matrix and reconsider the hypotheses—in some cases, analysts will need to add new hypotheses and re-examine the information available. Focus on disproving hypotheses rather than proving one. Talley the piece of evidence that are inconsistent and consistent with each hypothesis to see which explanations are the weakest and strongest. Analyze how sensitive the ACH results are to a few critical items of evidence; should those pieces prove to be wrong, misleading, or subject to deception, how would it impact an explanation’s validity? Ask what evidence is not being seen but would be expected for a given hypothesis to be true. Is denial and deception a possibility? Report all the conclusions, including the weaker hypotheses that should still be monitored as new information becomes available. Establish the relative likelihood for the hypotheses and report all the conclusions, including the weaker hypothese that should still be monitored as new information becomes available. Identify and monitor indicators that would be both consistent and inconsistent with the full set of hypotheses. In the latter case, explore what could account for inconsistent data. (US Government, 2009)
	•	One of the most respected analysts of the intelligence profession, Richards Heuer, has proposed a method of ‘‘Analysis of Competing Hypotheses’’ (ACH), which ‘‘requires the analyst to explicitly identify all reasonable alternatives and have them compete against one another for the analyst’s favor, rather than evaluating their plausibility one at a time.’’ Heuer’s method seeks to distinguish ‘‘key drivers’’ that are ‘‘diagnostic’’ in the sense that they ‘‘influence your judgment on the relative likelihood of the various hypotheses.’’ In this way, the ACH method forces the analyst to ‘‘begin with a full set of alternative hypotheses, to identify the few items of evidence or assumptions that have the greatest diagnostic value in judging [their] relative likelihood,...seeking evidence to refute hypotheses [rather than] looking for evidence to confirm a favored hypothesis.’’ (Weiss, 2008)
	•	Once the need to present alternative hypotheses is accepted, the next step is to estimate the relative probability of each—or if the alternative hypothesis is not well defined, one’s degree of confidence that one’s preferred interpretation is correct. (Weiss, 2008)
	•	the identification of a complete set of alternative hypotheses, the systematic evaluation of each through the examination of evidence and data that applies to them all, and the selection of the most explanatory or best-fitting hypothesis (or hypotheses) by focusing on information that tends to disconfirm weaker hypotheses. (Artner et al., 2016)
Collaborative-ACH
	•	Collaborative-ACH allows analytic teams to conduct ACH exercises from multiple locations in a web-based environment. (Pherson, 2009)
	•	It provides a common, web-based platform for analysts to collaborate either synchronously or asynchronously as inter-agency teams working from multiple geographic locations. (Pherson, 2009)
	•	It is particularly useful when analysts want to compare how they have loaded their data and identify key areas of disagreement. (Pherson, 2009)
Scenario analysis
	•	In the complex, evolving, and uncertain situations that intelligence analysts and policymakers must deal with, the future is not predictable. Usually, the best the analyst can do is to identify the driving forces that will determine that future and monitor those forces as they interact to become the future. Scenarios, plausible and provocative stories about how the future might unfold, are a principal vehicle for doing this. When alternative futures have been clearly outlined, policymakers can mentally rehearse these futures and ask themselves, “What should I be doing now to prepare for these futures?” (Pherson, 2009)
	•	Scenarios analysis provides a framework for considering multiple plausible futures. As Peter Schwartz, author of The Art of the Long View, has argued, “The future is plural.”iv Trying to divine or predict a single outcome is often a disservice to senior intelligence officials policymakers, and other valued clients. (Pherson, 2009)
	•	Generating several scenarios helps focus attention on the key underlying forces and factors most likely to influence how the situation develops. (Pherson, 2009)
	•	Scenarios can also be used to examine key assumptions and deliver useful warning messages when high impact/low probability scenarios are included in the exercise. (Pherson, 2009)
	•	Analysts facing more mysteries (unknowable) than secrets (discoverable), find it very useful to address intelligence questions by using the technique of multiple scenario development. (George, 2004)
	•	This powerful approach explores a range of possible outcomes when there are many unknowns and no certainty about a single outcome. (George, 2004)
	•	Typically, a group of experts will use structured brainstorming to identify key factors and forces that will shape an issue. First, experts will agree that a focal issue—for example, the testing of nuclear weapons in South Asia—is sufficiently important to justify exploring a range of futures. Next, experts describe what they believe is the conventional wisdom and general assumptions about the issue—e.g., a belief that neither India nor Pakistan would test because of international condemnation and possible sanctions. In the course of their brainstorming, analysts list areas of relative certainty (e.g., relative economic=political dependence on the U.S., technological capabilities to test, government control over nuclear materials, decisionmaking processes) and identify critical uncertainties (e.g., stability of governing coalitions, role of public opinion, perception of threat). Among those areas of uncertainty, analysts then select two or more key uncertainties (defined as drivers) and develop a matrix of possible alternative scenarios. (George, 2004)
	•	The virtue of scenario analysis is that it allows the decisionmaker to imagine what might happen under a range of plausible outcomes, and what actions might be needed to reduce the damage or take advantage of the opportunities posed. (George, 2004)
Alternative Futures Analysis
	•	The two most common techniques used in the Intelligence Community for generating scenarios are Alternative Futures Analysis and Multiple Scenarios Generation. (Pherson, 2009)
	•	Alternative Futures Analysis and Multiple Scenarios Generation differ from Simple Scenarios in that both usually use a group of experts, often including academics and policy makers, and employ a knowledgeable facilitator who uses a systematic process. Both techniques have proven highly effective in helping analysts, decisionmakers, and policymakers contemplate multiple futures, challenge their assumptions, and anticipate surprise developments by identifying “unknown unknowns.” Unknown unknowns are best identified as those factors, forces, or players that one did not realize were important or influential before commencing the scenarios analysis exercise. (Pherson, 2009)
	•	Alternative Futures Analysis usually focuses on only two driving forces. Each driving force is a spectrum with two extremes, and these drivers combine to make four possible scenarios. (Pherson, 2009)
	•	The human mind tends to see what it expects to see and to overlook the unexpected. Identifying indicators or signposts creates an awareness that prepares the mind to recognize early signs of significant change. Monitoring indicators and signposts is fundamental to much intelligence analysis, as it is the principal means of avoiding surprise. (Pherson, 2009)
	•	The classic application of indicators is to seek early warning of some undesirable event such as a military attack or a possible nuclear test by a foreign country. Today, indicators or signposts are often paired with scenarios to identify which of several possible scenarios is developing. They are also used to measure change toward an undesirable condition, such as political instability or a humanitarian crisis, or toward a desirable condition, such as economic reform or democratization. (Pherson, 2009)
	•	The Indicators Validator is a simple tool that was developed by Pherson Associates in 2008 to assess the diagnostic power of indicators. It is particularly useful when developing indicators for competing hypotheses or alternative scenarios. Once an analyst has developed a set of alternative scenarios or future worlds, the next step is to generate indicators for each scenario (or world) that would appear if that particular world were beginning to emerge. A critical question that is not often asked is whether a given indicator would appear only in the scenario to which it is assigned or in one or more alternative scenarios as well. Indicators that could appear in several scenarios are not considered diagnostic, suggesting that they are not particularly useful in determining whether a specific scenario is emerging. The ideal indicator is highly consistent for the world it is assigned and highly inconsistent for all other worlds. (Pherson, 2009)
	•	Systematically explores multiple ways a situation can develop when there is high complexity and uncertainty. (US Government, 2009)
	•	Alternative futures analysis (often referred to as “scenarios”) is most useful when a situation is viewed as too complex or the outcomes as too uncertain to trust a single outcome assessment. (US Government, 2009)
	•	First, analysts must recognize that there is high uncertainty surrounding the topic in question. Second, they, and often their customers, recognize that they need to consider a wide range of factors that might bear on the question. And third, they are prepared to explore a range of outcomes and are not wedded to any preconceived result. (US Government, 2009)
	•	Depending on how elaborate the futures project, the effort can amount to considerable investment in time, analytic resources, and money. A team of analysts can spend several hours or days organizing, brainstorming, and developing multiple futures; alternatively, a larger-scale effort can require preparing a multi-day workshop that brings together participants (including outside experts). Such an undertaking often demands the special skills of trained scenario-development facilitators and conferencing facilities. (US Government, 2009)
	•	multiple futures development is a divergent thinking technique that tries to use the complexity and uncertainty of a situation to describe multiple outcomes or futures that the analyst and policymaker should consider, rather than to predict one outcome. (US Government, 2009)
	•	Alternative futures analysis is extremely useful in highly ambiguous situations, when analysts confront not only a lot of “known unknowns” but also “unknown unknowns.” What this means is that analysts recognize that there are factors, forces, and dynamics among key actors that are difficult to identify without the use of some structured technique that can model how they would interact or behave. (US Government, 2009)
	•	As the outcomes are not known prior to the futures exercise, analysts must be prepared for the unexpected and willing to engage in a more free-wheeling exchange of views than typically occurs in order to “imagine the future.” (US Government, 2009)
	•	Given the time and resources involved, scenario analysis is best reserved for situations that could potentially pose grave threats or otherwise have significant consequences. (US Government, 2009)
	•	involving policymakers in the alternative futures exercise is the most effective way to communicate the results of this exploration of alternative outcomes and sensitize them to key uncertainties. Most participants find the process of developing such scenarios as useful as any finished product that attempts to capture the results of the exercise. (US Government, 2009)
	•	Analysts and policymakers can benefit from this technique in several ways: It provides an effective means of weighing multiple unknown or unknowable
	•	factors and presenting a set of plausible outcomes. It can help to bound a problem by identifying plausible combinations of uncertain factors. It provides a broader analytic framework for calculating the costs, risks, and opportunities presented to policymakers by different outcomes. It aids analysts and policymakers in anticipating what otherwise would be surprising developments by forcing them to challenge assumptions and consider possible “wild cards” or discontinuous events. It generates indicators to monitor for signs that a particular future is becoming more or less likely, so that policies can be reassessed. (US Government, 2009)
	•	Although there are a variety of ways to develop alternative futures, the most common approach used in both the public and private sectors involves the following steps: Develop the “focal issue” by systematically interviewing experts and officials who are examining the general topic. Convene a group of experts (both internal and external) to brainstorm about the forces and factors that could affect the focal issue. Select by consensus the two most critical and uncertain forces and convert these into axes or continua with the most relevant endpoints assigned. Establish the most relevant endpoints for each factor; e.g., if economic growth were the most critical, uncertain force, the endpoints could be “fast” and “slow” or “transformative” and “stabilizing” depending on the type of issue addressed. Form a futures matrix by crossing the two chosen axes. The four resulting quadrants provide the basis for characterizing alternative future worlds. Generate colorful stories that describe these futures and how they could plausibly come about. Signposts or indicators can then be developed. (US Government, 2009)
	•	Participants, especially policymakers, can then consider how current decisions or strategies would fare in each of the four worlds and identify alternative policies that might work better either across all the futures or in specific ones. 
	•	By anticipating alternative outcomes, policymakers have a better chance of either devising strategies flexible enough to accommodate multiple outcomes or of being prepared and agile in the face of change. (US Government, 2009)
Multiple Scenarios Generation
	•	The two most common techniques used in the Intelligence Community for generating scenarios are Alternative Futures Analysis and Multiple Scenarios Generation. (Pherson, 2009)
	•	Alternative Futures Analysis and Multiple Scenarios Generation differ from Simple Scenarios in that both usually use a group of experts, often including academics and policy makers, and employ a knowledgeable facilitator who uses a systematic process. Both techniques have proven highly effective in helping analysts, decisionmakers, and policymakers contemplate multiple futures, challenge their assumptions, and anticipate surprise developments by identifying “unknown unknowns.” Unknown unknowns are best identified as those factors, forces, or players that one did not realize were important or influential before commencing the scenarios analysis exercise. (Pherson, 2009)
	•	Multiple Scenarios Generation helps warning analysts and decisionmakers expand their imagination and avoid surprise by generating a much larger number of potential scenarios. For example, if analysts have identified five key drivers, the process can be used to generate as many as 40 different “stories” or scenarios. (Pherson, 2009)

Simple scenarios
	•	Simple Scenarios, that analysts can do at their desk or with a small group of colleagues. Simple Scenarios requires the analyst to define the focal issue; identify the forces, factors, and events most likely to influence the future; alter the “weights” or impact of each of these drivers to generate a best case scenario, worst case scenario, and a most likely scenario. Additional scenarios can be generated by flipping a key assumption or driver. Once a set of scenarios is defined, the analyst then describes the implications of each scenario, generates a set of indicators that would suggest that a particular scenario is beginning to play out, and monitors the list of indicators on a periodic basis. (Pherson, 2009)
High Impact/Low Probability Analysis
	•	In the warning arena, three techniques are particularly useful in helping the analyst anticipate low probability events and avoid surprise: High Impact/Low Probability Analysis, What If? Analysis, and the Pre-Mortem Assessment. (Pherson, 2009)
	•	Analysts employ High Impact/Low Probability Analysis to provide policymakers and military decisionmakers with early warning that a seemingly unlikely event with major policy and resource repercussions might actually occur. (Pherson, 2009)
	•	It should be used when one wants to alert policymakers and decisionmakers to the potential that a seemingly long-shot development that would have a major policy or resource impact may be more likely than previously anticipated. (Pherson, 2009)
	•	A High Impact/Low Probability study usually is initiated when some new and often fragmentary information is received suggesting that a previously unanticipated event might actually occur; for example, a tip-off suggesting the susceptibility of the United States to a major information warfare attack or a dramatic terrorist attack on a national holiday or on Election Day. (Pherson, 2009)
	•	The technique can also be used to sensitize analysts and decisionmakers to the possible effects of low probability events, to spur them to think in advance about what measures they could take to deal with the danger, or to exploit a previously unforeseen opportunity. (Pherson, 2009)
	•	The technique allows analysts to explore the consequences of an event—particularly one not deemed likely by conventional wisdom—without having to challenge the main-line judgment or to argue with others about how likely an event is to happen. (Pherson, 2009)
	•	It provides a tactful way of communicating a viewpoint that some recipients might prefer not to hear. The analytic focus is not on whether something will happen but to take as a given that an event could happen that would have a major and unanticipated impact. (Pherson, 2009)
	•	Highlights a seemingly unlikely event that would have major policy consequences if it happened. (US Government, 2009)
	•	High-Impact/Low-Probability Analysis is a contrarian technique that sensitizes analysts to the potential impact of seemingly low probability events that would have major repercussions on US interests. (US Government, 2009)
	•	Using this technique is advisable when analysts and policymakers are convinced that an event is unlikely but have not given much thought to the consequences of its occurrence. In essence, this can be a warning that the intelligence and policy communities must be alert to an unexpected but not impossible event. (US Government, 2009)
	•	analysts might have benefited from considering the consequences of such events and how they might plausibly have come about. (US Government, 2009)
	•	Mapping out the course of an unlikely, yet plausible, event can uncover hidden relationships between key factors and assumptions; it also can alert analysts to oversights in the mainstream analytic line. (US Government, 2009)
	•	an examination of the “unthinkable” allows analysts to develop signposts that may provide early warning of a shift in the situation. By periodically reviewing these indicators an analyst is more likely to counter any prevailing mind-set that such a development is highly unlikely. (US Government, 2009)
	•	If there is a strongly held view that an event is unlikely, then postulating precisely the opposite should not be difficult. Define the high-impact outcome clearly. This process is what will justify examining what most analysts believe to be a very unlikely development. Devise one or more plausible explanations for or “pathways” to the low probability outcome. This should be as precise as possible, as it can help identify possible indicators for later monitoring. Insert possible triggers or changes in momentum if appropriate. These can be natural disasters, sudden health problems of key leaders, or new economic or political shocks that might have occurred historically or in other parts of the world. Brainstorm with analysts having a broad set of experiences to aid the development of plausible but unpredictable triggers of sudden change. Identify for each pathway a set of indicators or “observables” that would help you anticipate that events were beginning to play out this way. Identify factors that would deflect a bad outcome or encourage a positive outcome. (US Government, 2009)
What If? Analysis
	•	In the warning arena, three techniques are particularly useful in helping the analyst anticipate low probability events and avoid surprise: High Impact/Low Probability Analysis, What If? Analysis, and the Pre-Mortem Assessment. (Pherson, 2009)
	•	What If? Analysis takes as a given that an event has occurred with potential major impact and then explains how it could come about. (Pherson, 2009)
	•	Warning analysts can use it to great effect when they are having difficulty getting others to focus on the possibility that an event might actually happen and to consider the consequences if it really does occur. (Pherson, 2009)
	•	It has also proved effective when dealing with deeply-engrained views within the analytic or policymaking community or when the “conventional wisdom” asserts that a certain event could not happen. (Pherson, 2009)
	•	The What If? technique forces the analyst to shift his or her focus away from whether an event will occur to imagining that it has occurred and then explaining how it might have happened. (Pherson, 2009)
	•	What If? Analysis shifts the discussion from “How likely is it?” to questions such as “How could it possibly come about?” “What would be the impact?” and “Has the possibility of the event happening increased?” (Pherson, 2009)
	•	The technique also gives decisionmakers a better sense of what they might be able to do today to either prevent an untoward development from occurring or to leverage a previously unrecognized opportunity for advancing their interests. (Pherson, 2009)
	•	contingency ‘‘what if ’’ analysis focuses on the possible causes and consequences of an unlikely event. For example, what if India were to decide to conduct nuclear tests (as it later did) and seek to deceive the United States? The analysts would then be compelled to consider the motives behind such a decision; they also would determine the ‘‘signposts’’ or indicators preceding that decision or alternately, how the Indians might try to hide preparations from U.S. intelligence, and the indications of such deception. (George, 2004)
	•	Such ‘‘what if ’’ thinking forces analysts to discard the obvious American way of thinking. And, unlike Devil’s Advocacy, the thinking is not contrived to argue a specific outcome, regardless of the merits of the case; instead, it asks the awkward question that might lead to further questions regarding the quality of U.S. intelligence information, the presence of foreign deception, and the possibly faulty linchpin assumption that underlies current intelligence judgements. (George, 2004)
	•	Assumes that an event has occurred with potential (negative or positive) impact and explains how it might come about. (US Government, 2009)
	•	“What If?” analysis is another contrarian technique for challenging a strong mind- set that an event will not happen or that a confidently made forecast may not be entirely justified. It is similar to a High-Impact/Low-Probability analysis, but it does not dwell on the consequences of the event as much as it accepts the significance and moves directly to explaining how it might come about. (US Government, 2009)
	•	By shifting the focus from whether an event could occur to how it may happen, analysts allow themselves to suspend judgment about the likelihood of the event and focus more on what developments— even unlikely ones—might enable such an outcome. (US Government, 2009)
	•	Using this technique is particularly important when a judgment rests on limited information or unproven assumptions. Moreover, it can free analysts from arguing about the probability of an event to considering its consequences and developing some indicators or signposts for its possible emergence. It will help analysts address the impact of an event, the factors that could cause—or alter—it, and likely signposts that an event is imminent. (US Government, 2009)
	•	A “What If?” analysis can complement a difficult judgment reached and provide the policymaker a thoughtful caution to accepting the conventional wisdom without considering the costs and risks of being wrong. This can help decision- makers consider ways to hedge their bets, even if they accept the analytic judgment that an event remains unlikely. (US Government, 2009)
	•	Like other contrarian methods, “What If?” analysis must begin by stating clearly the conventional analytic line and then stepping back to consider what alternative outcomes are too important to dismiss, even if unlikely. (US Government, 2009)
	•	Brainstorming over a few days or weeks can develop one or more plausible scenarios by which the unlikely event occurs: Assume the event has happened. Select some triggering events that permitted the scenario to unfold to help make the “what if” more plausible; for example, analysts might postulate the death of a leader, a natural disaster, or some economic event that would start a chain of other events. Develop a chain of argumentation based as much on logic as evidence to explain how this outcome could have come about. “Think backwards” from the event in concrete ways–that is, specifying what must actually occur at each stage of the scenario is often very useful. Identify one or more plausible pathways or scenarios to the unlikely event; very often more than one will appear possible. Generate a list of indicators or “observables” for each scenario that would help to detect the beginnings of the event. Consider the scope of the positive and negative consequences of each scenario and their relative impacts. Monitor the indicators developed on a periodic basis. (US Government, 2009)
Pre-Mortem Assessment
	•	In the warning arena, three techniques are particularly useful in helping the analyst anticipate low probability events and avoid surprise: High Impact/Low Probability Analysis, What If? Analysis, and the Pre-Mortem Assessment. (Pherson, 2009)
	•	The goal of the Pre-Mortem Assessment is to reduce the risk of surprise and the subsequent need for a postmortem investigation of what went wrong. (Pherson, 2009)
	•	It is an easy-to-use technique that enables a group of analysts who have been working together on any type of future-oriented analysis to challenge the accuracy of their own conclusions. (Pherson, 2009)
	•	The method is for the team leader to pose a question along the lines of the following: “It looks like we have the right answer, but we haven’t done as much as we should to ensure there are no major flaws in our analytic process. Let’s imagine that we have sent our analysis forward, and now, several months later, we learn that our analytic judgment was flat wrong and we have failed spectacularly. Working from that assumption, let’s figure out how we could have failed.” (Pherson, 2009)
	•	The Pre-Mortem Assessment is similar to the previous two techniques in that it asks an analyst or decisionmaker to imagine the occurrence of some future condition and then to reflect on what might cause it. (Pherson, 2009)
	•	The technique empowers team members who might have had unspoken reservations about a line of analysis or the team consensus to speak out in a context that is not threatening. (Pherson, 2009)
	•	In this group exercise, individuals imagine fiascoes relating to their areas of responsibility—in the case of intelligence analysis, a warning failure—and brainstorm about how they might come about and how they could be headed
	•	off. The very pointed emphasis on the negative, Klein argues, helps to shake up complacency that arises from common overconfidence in judgments. Such an exercise would be a functional equivalent of the “low probability/high impact” exercise of traditional alternative analysis, with the difference that its informal nature lends it to more frequent use. (Fishbein and Treverton, 2004)
	•	The Premortem technique raises awareness of possibilities, including their likely consequences, to enrich planning. (Serrat, 2017)
	•	Enter, thanks to Klein (2007), the Premortem technique: based on a process known as reframing, this risk-mitigation planning tool attempts to identify threats at the outset. Specifically, it helps challenge key assumptions, generate multiple hypotheses, discover unknown unknowns, track alternative future trajectories, and anticipate the unanticipated. For sure, by testing, probing, and even attacking individual and collective mindsets, greater rigor in critical thinking can reduce the chance of (unpleasant) surprises. (Serrat, 2017)
	•	A premortem is the imaginary converse of an autopsy; the hindsight this intelligence assessment offers is prospective. (Serrat, 2017)
	•	n sum, tasking a team to imagine that its plan has already been implemented and failed miserably increases the ability of its members to correctly identify reasons for negative future outcomes. This is because taking a team out of the context of defending its plan and shielding it from flaws opens new perspectives from which the team can actively search for faults.7 Despite its original high level of confidence, a team can then candidly identify multiple explanations for failure, possibilities that were not mentioned let alone considered when the team initially proposed then developed the plan. The expected outcomes of such stress-testing are increased appreciation of the uncertainties inherent in any projection of the future and identification of markers that, if incorporated in the team’s design and monitoring framework and subsequently tracked, would give early warning that progress is not being achieved as expected. (Serrat, 2017)
	•	The Premortem technique is low cost and high payoff. Its application is straightforward and need not take more than 1 or 2 hours, preferably with the help of a facilitator. (Serrat, 2017)
	•	A pre-mortem — also known as a premortem — is a managerial strategy in which a manager imagines that a project or organization has failed, and then works backward to determine what potentially could lead to the failure of the project or organization. (Gnanaraj, 2016)
	•	A premortem is the hypothetical opposite of a postmortem. A postmortem in a medical setting allows health professionals and the family to learn what caused a patient’s death. Everyone benefits except, of course, the patient. A premortem in a business setting comes at the beginning of a project rather than the end, so that the project can be improved rather than autopsied. Unlike a typical critiquing session, in which project team members are asked what might go wrong, the premortem operates on the assumption that the “patient” has died, and so asks what did go wrong. The team members’ task is to generate plausible reasons for the project’s failure. (Klein, 2007)
	•	A typical premortem begins after the team has been briefed on the plan. (Klein, 2007)
	•	The goal of these techniques is to challenge – actively and explicitly – an established mental model or analytic consensus in order to broaden the range of possible explanations or estimates that are seriously considered. This process helps reduce the risk of analytic failure by identigying and analysing the features of a potential failure before it occurs. (Beebe and Pherson, 2012)

Team A/Team B
	•	This technique has been used periodically when major strategic issues have been judged too important to let conventional wisdom drive policy. (George, 2004)
	•	But the technique need not be used only when national policy issues are at stake. Whenever opposing views of an issue are strongly held there is utility in laying out each side’s linchpin assumptions and key drivers, then explicitly describing how the data supports their conclusions. (George, 2004)
	•	In presenting both sides of an argument, advocates on either team are exposed to an alternative way of thinking about an issue. Thus, a dialogue over analytical assumptions and logic is opened rather than a simple focus on the key conclusions of either side’s analysis. (George, 2004)
	•	Unlike Devil’s Advocacy, this approach is not contrived analysis. In the real world, analysts on both sides of an issue are usually present. Thus, the Team A/Team B method can take advantage of analytical disagreements and put both sides of important issues before the policymaker. (George, 2004)
	•	Many analysts will react defensively to the notion of using a Team A/Team B approach if it is perceived to be a blatant condemnation of their analysis and tradecraft. Some analysts can become so personally invested in being proven right that any hope of understanding the assumptions and logic behind analytical judgments, or of learning how to improve analysis, is derailed. (George, 2004)
	•	Use of separate analytic teams that contrast two (or more) strongly held views or competing hypotheses. (US Government, 2009)
	•	Team A/Team B recognizes that there may be competing and possibly equally strong mind-sets held on an issue that need to be clarified. (US Government, 2009)
	•	If there are at least two competing views within an analytic office or perhaps competing opinions within the policymaking community on a key issue, then Team A/Team B analysis can be the appropriate technique to use. (US Government, 2009)
	•	Developing a full-blown Team A/Team B exercise requires a significant commitment of analytic time and resources, so it is worthwhile considering if the analytic issue merits this kind of attention. (US Government, 2009)
	•	A longstanding policy issue, a critical decision that has far-reaching implications, or a dispute within the analytic community that has obstructed effective cross-agency cooperation would be grounds for using Team A/Team B. If those circumstances exist, then analysts will need to review all of the data to develop alternative papers that can capture the essential differences between the two viewpoints. (US Government, 2009)
	•	a Team A/Team B approach can help opposing experts see the merit in the other group’s perspective. (US Government, 2009)
	•	The process of conducting such an exercise can reduce the friction and even narrow the differences. At a minimum, it allows those holding opposing views to feel that their views have been given equal attention. (US Government, 2009)
	•	For the policymaker, this technique helps to surface and explain important analytic differences within the expert community. Often senior officials can learn more by weighing well-argued conflicting views than from reading an assessment that masks substantive differences or drives analysis to the lowest common denominator. (US Government, 2009)
	•	By making the key assumptions and information used for each argument more transparent, a policymaker can judge the merits of each case, pose questions back to the analysts, and reach an independent judgment on which argument is the strongest. Moreover, highlighting alternative views puts collectors on notice that they need to be searching for new information that can confirm or disconfirm a range of hypotheses. (US Government, 2009)
	•	If opposing positions are well established, it can be useful to place analysts on teams that will advocate positions they normally do not support; forcing analysts to argue “the other side” can often make them more aware of their own mind-set. (US Government, 2009)
	•	Analysis Phase. A Team A/Team B exercise can be conducted on an important issue to: Identify the two (or more) competing hypotheses or points of view. Form teams or designate individuals to develop the best case that can be made for each hypothesis. Review all pertinent information that supports their respective positions. Identify missing information that would buttress their hypotheses. Structure each argument with an explicit presentation of key assumptions, key pieces of evidence, and careful articulation of the logic behind the argument. (US Government, 2009)
	•	Debate Phase. An oral presentation of the alternative arguments and rebuttals in parallel fashion can then be organized for the benefit of other analysts: Set aside time for an oral presentation of the alternative team findings; this can an informal brainstorming session or a more formal “debate.” Have an independent “jury of peers” listen to the oral presentation and be prepared to question the teams regarding their assumptions, evidence, or logic. Allow each team to present their case, challenge the other team’s arguments, and rebut the opponent’s critique of its case. Let the jury consider the strength of each presentation and recommend possible next steps for further research and collection efforts. (US Government, 2009)
	•	The pertinent facts of the A-B caseare (a) that PFIAB commisioned three ad hoc outside groups (composing the " B Team") to examine the data available to the U.S. intelligence
community’s analysts (the " A Team"), to determine whether such data would support conclusions on Soviet strategic capabilities and objectives different from those presented in the community's NIE's; and (b) that during the exercise details of these sensitive questions leaked on several occasions to the press. (CIA, 1978)
	•	The A-Team/I3-Team experiment has also been explained as an effort to allow greater dissent and conflicting views. (CIA, 1978)
	•	This group (the "B Team") was to examine all the data available to the analysts of the intelligence community to, in the words of the committee statement, "determine whether such data would support conclusions on Soviet strategic capabilities and objectives different from those presented in the intelligence community's National Intelligence Estimates." (CIA, 1978)
	•	The B-Team demonstrated that it was possible to construct a sharply different view of Soviet motivation from the consensus view of the analysts and one that provided a much closer fIt to the Soviets observed behavior (and also provided a much better forecast of subsequent behavior up to and through the invasion ofAfghanistan). The formal presentation of the competing views in a session out at CIA headquarters in] Langley also made clear that the enormous experience and expertise of the B- Team as a group were formidable. Unfortunately, the bureaucratic reaction to the whole experience was largely negative and hostile. (Davis, 1996)
Outside in Think
	•	Used to identify the full range of basic forces, factors, and trends that would indirectly shape an issue. (US Government, 2009)
	•	Analysts find this technique most useful at the conceptualization of an analytic project, when the goal is to identify all the critical, external factors that could influence how a particular situation will develop. It would work well for a group of analysts responsible for a range of functional and/or regional issues. (US Government, 2009)
	•	When assembling a large database that must identify a number of information categories or database fields, this technique can aid in visualizing the entire set of categories that might be needed in a research effort. Often analysts realize only too late that some additional information categories will be needed and then must go back and review all previous files and recode the data. (US Government, 2009)
	•	With a modest amount of effort, “Outside-in Thinking” can reduce the risk of missing important variables early in the analytic process. (US Government, 2009)
	•	“thinking from the outside-in” begins by considering the external changes that might, over time, profoundly affect the analysts’ own field or issue. This technique encourages analysts to get away from their immediate analytic tasks (the so-called “inbox”) and think about their issues in a wider conceptual and contextual framework. By recasting the problem in much broader and fundamental terms, analysts are more likely to uncover additional factors, an important dynamic, or a relevant alternative hypothesis. (US Government, 2009)
	•	The process begins by developing a generic description of the problem or the phenomenon under study. Then, analysts should: List all the key forces (social, technological, economic, environmental, and political) that could have an impact on the topic, but over which one can exert little influence (e.g., globalization, social stress, the Internet, or the global economy). Focus next on key factors over which an actor or policymaker can exert some influence. In the business world this might be the market size, customers, the competition, suppliers or partners; in the government domain it might include the policy actions or the behavior of allies or adversaries. Assess how each of these forces could affect the analytic problem. Determine whether these forces actually do have an impact on the particular issue based on the available evidence. (US Government, 2009)
Red Cell
	•	As the Jeremiah Commission noted, the Intelligence Community should be making more frequent use of a ‘‘red cell’’ approach to analyzing foreign government behavior, and avoid the tendency to ‘‘mirror-image’’ U.S. adversaries. (George, 2004)
	•	Accordingly, a ‘‘red cell’’ is a group of analysts assembled to role-play senior leaders of a foreign government or entity, and to propose courses of actions that would complicate American foreign and security policy objectives. (George, 2004)
	•	Through this technique, analysts attempt to step out of an ‘‘American strategic logic’’ and instead reflect an adversary’s mode of thinking. (George, 2004)
	•	To be effective, the ‘‘red cell’’ draws from country experts, who understand the other nation’s culture, as well as its political system; to the extent possible, these analysts try to look at the situation from the enemy’s vantage point and produce recommendations that would approximate the cultural norms, decision-making style, and nationalist rhetoric used within actual foreign governing circles. (George, 2004)
	•	As a written art-form, then, a ‘‘red cell’’ might produce a briefing book for a putative Saddam Hussein or Slobodan Milosevic on how to counter American diplomatic and military pressures. (George, 2004)
	•	These red cell products are aimed at provoking thinking among policymakers and strategists, and are not designed to be consensus-driven assessments. (George, 2004)
	•	such ‘‘outside the box’’ analysis can also blur the line between intelligence analysis and policy advocacy. (George, 2004)
	•	Properly done, and with explicit caveats about its intended purposes, red cell work has found an eager policymaking audience and contributed to more creative strategic planning. (George, 2004)
	•	Models the behavior of an individual or group by trying to replicate how an adversary would think about an issue. (US Government, 2009)
	•	Red Team analysis tries to consciously place analysts in the same cultural, organizational, and personal setting (“putting them in their shoes”) in which the target individual or group operates. Whereas analysts normally work from the position of the “blue” (friendly forces), a “red” team of analysts attempts to work in the environment of the hostile forces. (US Government, 2009)
	•	Like Devil’s Advocacy and Team A/Team B techniques, Red Team analysis is aimed at freeing the analyst from the prison of a well-developed mind-set; in this case, the analyst’s own sense of rationality, cultural norms, and personal values. (US Government, 2009)
	•	Whereas analysts usually operate as “observers” of a foreign adversary, the Red Team technique transforms the analyst into an “actor” operating within the adversary’s culture and political milieu. This form of “role playing” is useful when trying to replicate the mind-set of authoritarian leaders, terrorist cells, or other non-Western groups that operate under very different codes of behavior or motivations. (US Government, 2009)
	•	Often this technique can introduce new or different stimuli that might not have been factored into traditional analysis—such as the target’s familial ties or the international political, economic, and military pressures felt by the individual. (US Government, 2009)
	•	Red Team participants might ask themselves: “What would my peers, family, or tribe expect me to do? Alternatively, a Red Team analyst might pose the question to his colleagues: “How do we perceive the external threats and opportunities?” Finally, the Red Team technique can factor into its analysis the way in which personal power and status might influence a target’s behavior. (US Government, 2009)
	•	The team should be populated not just with those who understand the language, but also with people who might have experienced the culture, share the ethnic background, or have worked in a similar operational environment. Once established and separated from traditional analysis, the team members should: Put themselves in the adversary’s circumstances and react to foreign stimuli as the target would. Develop a set of “first-person” questions that the adversary would ask, such as: “How would I perceive incoming information; what would be my personal concerns; or to whom would I look for an opinion?” Draft a set of policy papers in which the leader or group makes specific decisions, proposes recommendations, or lays out courses of actions. The more these papers reflect the cultural and personal norms of the target, the more they can offer a different perspective on the analytic problem. (US Government, 2009)
	•	Red Team analysis is not easy to conduct. It requires significant time to develop a team of qualified experts who can think like the adversary. The team has to distance itself from the normal analysis and work as though living in the target’s world. Without a sophisticated understanding of the culture, operational environment, and personal histories of the foreign group, analysts will not be able to behave or think like the enemy. Analysts can never truly escape their own experiences and mind- sets, but this technique can at least prevent them from falling into “mirror-imaging” unconsciously. (US Government, 2009)
	•	The most novel feature of Red Team analysis is its presentation. The analysis is often in a “first person” format—that is, drafted as memos to or from a leader or group. Red Team analysis avoids the use of caveats or qualifications and assumes that the recipient understands that the paper is aimed more at provoking thought or challenging the conventional understanding of how an adversary thinks. Such papers are rarely coordinated among other experts and do not purport to represent the consensus view on an issue. (US Government, 2009)
	•	Red Team papers do not plot out all possible courses of action but seek to give a prediction based on the target’s special personal, organizational, or cultural experiences. (US Government, 2009)
Red cell analysts
	•	Red cell analysts are sometimes encouraged to devise creative courses of action that might undermine adversaries, without any expectation that they would reflect the analysts’ policy preferences. (George, 2004)
High Impact/Low Probability Analysis
	•	Like ‘‘what if’’ analysis, this technique focuses on the examination of unlikely events of the kind that would have huge consequences for the United States. In this situation, analysts accept as a given that the event itself—such as an Indian nuclear test—has significant implications and focus instead on the possible ways by which the Indian government might decide to conduct a test. In this case, analysts look for plausible combinations of domestic and international factors that could precipitate the occurrence of an unlikely event. (George, 2004)
	•	What changes in key assumptions, or different sets of key drivers, would have to be present to overturn the prevailing analytical line that India would not test a nuclear device. Such argumentation is probably most useful as a longer analysis for a policymaker who is already expert on the issues and likely shares the conventional wisdom. (George, 2004)
	•	The HI/LP analysis is more valuable to such specialists as a check on their own thinking, and less valuable to the policymaker who is a generalist and does not have a well-formed opinion on the issue. (George, 2004)
Barbelling
	•	The specific suggestion raised in workshop discussions involved the practice— known as “barbelling”—used by some Wall Street firms, which involves pairing young financial professionals with those over 50 to marry adventurousness with caution born of experience. Firms with such an age distribution, according to a noted presenter from the financial community, tend to perform better than those whose professionals cluster in the thirty-to-fifty age range. (Fishbein and Treverton, 2004)
Signposts of change
	•	An analyst or team can create an indicators or signposts list of observable events that one would expect to see if a postulated situation is developing; e.g., economic reform, military modernization, political instability, or democratization. (US Government, 2009)
	•	Constructing the list might require only a few hours or as much as several days to identify the critical variables associated with the targeted issue. (US Government, 2009)
	•	The technique can be used whenever an analyst needs to track an event over time to monitor and evaluate changes. (US Government, 2009)
	•	it can also be a very powerful aid in supporting other structured methods explained later in this primer. In those instances, analysts would be watching for mounting evidence to support a particular hypothesis, low- probability event, or scenario. (US Government, 2009)
	•	When there are sharply divided views on an issue, an indicators or signposts list can also “depersonalize” the argument by shifting analytic attention to a more objective set of criteria. (US Government, 2009)
	•	Using an indicators list can clarify substantive disagreements, once all sides agree on the set of objective criteria used to measure the topic under study. (US Government, 2009)
	•	An indicators list included in a finished product also allows the policymaker to track developments and builds a more concrete case for the analytic judgments. (US Government, 2009)
	•	By laying out a list of critical variables, analysts also will be generating hypotheses regarding why they expect to see the presence of such factors. In so doing, analysts make the analytic line much more transparent and available for scrutiny by others. (US Government, 2009)

Success
	•	Success is now understood in the context of what we call ‘wicked problems’, which are part of the lexicon of the risk age. (Coker, 2009)
	•	with success come responsibilities and the need to live up to them. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Losing contact with reality, we make irrational decisions. That is why our success often does not last.  (Greene, 2018)
	•	Any success that we have in life inevitably depends on some good luck, timing, the contributions of others, the teachers who helped us along the way, the whims of the public in need of something new. Our tendency is to forget all of this and imagine that any success stems from our superior self. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Success has an irresistible pull to it that tends to cloud our minds. (Greene, 2018)
	•	After any kind of success, analyze the components. See the element of luck that is inevitably there, as well as the role that other people, including mentors, played in your good fortune. This will neutralize the tendency to inflate your powers. Remind yourself that with success comes complacency, as attention becomes more important than the work and old strategies are repeated. With success you must raise your vigilance. Wipe the slate clean with each new project, starting from zero. Try to pay less attention to the applause as it grows louder. See the limits to what you can accomplish and embrace them, working with what you have. Don’t believe bigger is better; consolidating and concentrating your forces is often the wiser choice. Be wary of offending with your growing sense of superiority—you will need your allies. Compensate for the drug-like effect of success by keeping your feet planted firmly on the ground. The power you will build up in this slow and organic way will be more real and lasting. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Getting what you want is rarely easy. Success will depend on a lot of effort and some luck. To make your project work, you will probably have to jettison your previous strategy—circumstances are always changing and you need to keep an open mind. The people you are trying to reach never respond exactly as you might have imagined or hoped. In fact, people will generally surprise and frustrate you in their reactions. They have their own needs, experiences, and particular psychology that are different from your own. To impress your targets,you will have to focus on them and their spirit. If you fail to accomplish what you want, you will have to examine carefully what you did wrong and strive to learn from the experience. (Greene, 2018)
	•	You can think of the project or task ahead of you as a block of marble you must sculpt into something precise and beautiful. The block is much larger than you and the material is quite resistant, but the task is not impossible. With enough effort, focus, and resiliency you can slowly carve it into what you need. You must begin, however, with a proper sense of proportion—goals are hard to reach, people are resistant, and you have limits to what you can do. With such a realistic attitude, you can summon up the requisite patience and get to work. (Greene, 2018)
	•	money and success that last come from remaining original and not mindlessly following the path that others are following. If we make money our primary goal, we never truly cultivate our uniqueness, and eventually someone younger and hungrier will supplant us. (Greene, 2018)
Sudden success
	•	Sudden success or winnings can be very dangerous. Neurologically, chemicals are released in the brain that give a powerful jolt of arousal and energy, leading to the desire to repeat this experience. It can be the start of any kind of addiction and manic behavior. (Greene, 2018)
	•	when gains come quickly we tend to lose sight of the basic wisdom that true success, to really last, must come through hard work. We do not take into account the role that luck plays in such sudden gains. We try again and again to recapture that high from winning so much money or attention. We acquire feelings of grandiosity. We become especially resistant to anyone who tries to warn us—they don’t understand, we tell ourselves. Because this cannot be sustained, we experience an inevitable fall, which is all the more painful, leading to the depression part of the cycle. Although gamblers are the most prone to this, it equally applies to businesspeople during bubbles and to people who gain sudden attention from the public. (Greene, 2018)
	•	whenever you experience unusual gains or losses, that is precisely the time to step back and counterbalance them with some necessary pessimism or optimism. Be extra wary of sudden success and attention—they are not built on anything that lasts and they have an addictive pull. And the fall is always painful. (Greene, 2018)
Successful individual
	•	We come to believe that a person who has success must by nature be generous, intelligent, and good, and that they deserve everything they have gotten. But successful people come in all shapes. Some are good at using others to get where they have gotten, masking their own incompetence. Some are completely manipulative. (Greene, 2018)
	•	It would be wise to look at those who are successful in their field. Inevitably we will see that most of them are much less bound by these codes. They are generally more assertive and overtly ambitious. They care much less what others think of them. They flout the conventions openly and proudly. And they are not punished but greatly rewarded. Steve Jobs is a classic example. He showed his rough, Shadow side in his way of working with others. Our tendency in looking at people like Jobs is to admire their creativity and subtract their darker qualities as unnecessary. If only he had been nicer, he would have been a saint. But in fact the dark side was inextricably interwoven with his power and creativity. His ability to not listen to others, to go his own way, and be a bit rough about it were key parts of his success, which we venerate. And so it is with many creative, powerful people. Subtract their active Shadow, and they would be like everyone else. (Greene, 2018)
	•	If people are successful, notice how they act in more private moments. Are they able to relax and laugh at themselves, letting go of their public mask, or have they so overidentified with their powerful public image that it carries over into their private life? In the latter case, they have come to believe in their own myth and are in the grip of powerful grandiosity. (Greene, 2018)
Suggestion
	•	To put yourself in the inferior, one-down position, you can commit some relatively harmless faux pas, even offend people in a more pronounced way, and then ask for their forgiveness. By asking for this, you imply their moral superiority, a position people love to occupy. Now they are vulnerable to suggestion. (Greene, 2018)

	•	Rien ne frappe davantage l'imagination des foules de toutes catégories que les représentations théâtrales. Toute la salle éprouve en même temps les mêmes émotions, et si ces émotions ne se transforment pas aussitôt en actes, c'est que le spectateur le plus inconscient ne peut ignorer qu'il est victime d'illusions, et qu'il a ri ou pleuré à d'imaginaires aventures. Parfois cependant les sentiments suggérés par les images sont si forts qu'ils tendent, comme les suggestions habituelles, à se transformer en actes. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Les foules tombant, après une certaine période d'excitation, à l'état de simples automates inconscients menés par des suggestions. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Nous reconnaissons ici tous les facteurs de persuasion que nous avons décrits. Nous allons les retrouver encore dans l'action des mots et des formules dont nous avons déjà montré le magique empire. L'orateur qui sait les manier conduit à volonté les foules où il veut. Des expressions telles que l'infâme capital, les vils exploiteurs, l'admirable ouvrier, la socialisation des richesses, etc., produisent toujours le même effet, bien qu'un peu usés déjà. Mais le candidat qui trouve une formule neuve, bien dépourvue de sens précis, et par conséquent pouvant répondre aux aspirations les plus diverses, obtient un succès infaillible. La sanglante révolution espagnole de 1873 a été faite avec un de ces mots magiques, au sens complexe, que chacun peut interpréter à sa façon. (Lebon, 1895)

Suggestibility
	•	celle-ci semble découler d’une sorte de magnétisme (« effluves », dit Le Bon) que le meneur exerce sur la foule comme l’hypnotiseur sur l’hypnotisé (1895). (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Là se trouverait un des principaux mécanismes constitutifs de l’âme collective : la suggestibilité. Ce caractère s’ajoute à l’anonymat et à la contagion mentale pour former le triptyque sur lequel repose la théorie de Le Bon. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	l’attachement sentimental des individus pour leur chef s’explique par un investissement libidinal. Pour le reste, l’inconscient est différemment défini chez l’un et l’autre auteur, le père de la psychanalyse ne voulant pas y voir autre chose que le refoulé. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Le troisième facteur, qui est de loin le plus important pour G. Le Bon, c’est la « suggestibilité » (ibid.). Croyant s’engager alors sur le terrain ferme de la physiologie, il postule la quasi-identité de l’état de l’individu en foule avec l’état hypnotique. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Il n’est plus lui-même, mais un automate que sa volonté est devenue impuissante à guider ». (Mannoni, 1985)

(Lebon, 1895)
	•	La création des légendes qui circulent si aisément dans les foules n'est pas déterminée seulement par une crédulité complète. Elle l'est encore par les déformations prodigieuses que subissent les événements dans l'imagination de gens assemblés. L'événement le plus simple vu par la foule est bientôt un événement transformé. Elle pense par images, et l'image évoquée en évoque elle-même une série d'autres n'ayant aucun lien logique avec la première. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	La raison nous montre ce que dans ces images il y a d'incohérence, mais la foule ne le voit guère; et ce que son imagination déformante ajoute à l'événement réel, elle le confondra avec lui. La foule ne sépare guère le subjectif de l'objectif. Elle admet comme réelles les images évoquées dans son esprit, et qui le plus souvent n'ont qu'une parenté lointaine avec le fait observé. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Dans cet exemple on voit se dérouler bien clairement le mécanisme de l'hallucination collective tel que nous l'avons expliqué. D'un côté, une foule en état d'attention expectante; de l'autre, une suggestion faite par la vigie signalant un bâtiment désemparé en mer, suggestion qui, par voie de contagion, fut acceptée par tous les assistants, officiers ou matelots. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Dès que quelques individus sont réunis, ils constituent une foule, et, alors même qu'ils seraient des savants distingués, ils prennent tous les caractères des foules pour ce qui est en dehors de leur spécialité. (Lebon, 1895)

	•	Connaissons-nous un seul mot de vrai concernant la vie des grands hommes qui ont joué les rôles prépondérants dans l'humanité, tels que Hercule, Bouddha, Jésus ou Mahomet? Très probablement non. Au fond d'ailleurs, leur vie réelle nous importe fort peu. Ce que nous avons intérêt à connaître, ce sont les grands hommes tels que la légende populaire les a fabriqués. Ce sont les héros légendaires, et pas du tout les héros réels, qui ont impressionné l'âme des foules. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Il n'est même pas besoin que les siècles aient passé sur les héros pour que leur légende soit transformée par l'imagination des foules. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Sous les Bourbons, Napoléon devint une sorte de personnage idyllique philanthrope et libéral, ami des humbles, qui, au dire des poètes, devaient conserver son souvenir sous le chaume pendant bien longtemps. Trente ans après, le héros débonnaire était devenu un despote sanguinaire qui, après avoir usurpé le pouvoir et la liberté, fit périr trois millions d'hommes uniquement pour satisfaire son ambition. De nos jours, nous assistons à une nouvelle transformation de la légende. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	l'histoire ne peut guère éterniser que des mythes. (Lebon, 1895)

	•	Il était donc nécessaire de montrer comment le système actuel l'a façonnée, et comment la masse des indifférents et des neutres est devenue progressivement une immense armée de mécontents, prête à obéir à toutes les suggestions des utopistes et des rhéteurs. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	La puissance des mots est liée aux images qu'ils évoquent et est indépendante de leur sens réel.—Ces images varient d'âge en âge, de race en race. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	En étudiant l'imagination des foules, nous avons vu qu'elle est impressionnée surtout par des images. Ces images, on n'en dispose pas toujours, mais il est possible de les évoquer par l'emploi judicieux des mots et des formules. Maniés avec art, ils possèdent vraiment la puissance mystérieuse que leur attribuaient jadis les adeptes de la magie. Ils font naître dans l'âme des foules les plus formidables tempêtes, et savent aussi les calmer. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	La puissance des mots est liée aux images qu'ils évoquent et tout à fait indépendante de leur signification réelle. Ce sont parfois ceux dont le sens est le plus mal défini qui possèdent le plus d'action. Tels par exemple, les termes: démocratie, socialisme, égalité, liberté, etc., dont le sens est si vague que de gros volumes ne suffisent pas à le préciser. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Ils synthétisent les aspirations inconscientes les plus diverses et l'espoir de leur réalisation.  (Lebon, 1895)
	•	La raison et les arguments ne sauraient lutter contre certains mots et certaines formules. On les prononce avec recueillement devant les foules; et, dès qu'ils ont été prononcés, les visages deviennent respectueux et les fronts s'inclinent. Beaucoup les considèrent comme des forces de la nature, des puissances surnaturelles. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Les images évoquées par les mots étant indépendantes de leur sens, varient d'âge en âge, de peuple à peuple, sous l'identité des formules. À certains mots s'attachent transitoirement certaines images: le mot n'est que le bouton d'appel qui les fait apparaître. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Si l'on considère une langue déterminée, on voit que les mots dont elle se compose changent assez lentement dans le cours des âges; (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Que faisons-nous, en réalité, quand nous substituons un terme français à un terme latin, grec ou sanscrit, ou même quand nous cherchons à comprendre un livre écrit dans notre propre langue il y a deux ou trois siècles? Nous substituons simplement les images et les idées que la vie moderne a mises dans notre intelligence, aux notions et aux images absolument différentes que la vie ancienne avait fait naître dans l'âme de races soumises à des conditions d'existence sans analogie avec les nôtres. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Les mots n'ont donc que des significations mobiles et transitoires, changeantes d'âge en âge et de peuple à peuple; et, quand nous voulons agir par eux, sur la foule, ce qu'il faut savoir, c'est le sens qu'ils ont pour elle à un moment donné, et non celui qu'ils eurent jadis ou qu'ils peuvent avoir pour des individus de constitution mentale différente. (Lebon, 1895)

	•	The tendency the group has to standardize the habits of individuals and to assign logical reasons for them is an important factor in the work of the public relations counsel. The predominant point of view, according to Mr. Trotter, which translates a rationalized point of view into an axiomatic truth, arises and derives its strength from the fact that it enlists herd support for the point of view of the individual. This explains why it is so easy to popularize many ideas. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	“The cardinal quality of the herd is the homogeneity.”3 The biological significance of homogeneity lies in its survival value. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	These results of homogeneity have created the “herd” point of view. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	One of the psychological results of homogeneity is the fact that physical loneliness is a real terror to the gregarious animal, and that association with the herd causes a feeling of security. In man this fear of loneliness creates a desire for identification with the herd in matters of opinion. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	Each one of us in his opinions and his conduct, in matters of amusement, religion, and politics, is compelled to obtain the support of a class, of a herd within the herd.” (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	“The effect of it will clearly be to make acceptable those suggestions which come from the herd, and those only. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	We may sincerely think that we vote the Republican ticket because we have thought out the issues of the political campaign and reached our decision in the cold-blooded exercise of judgment. The fact remains that it is just as likely that we voted the Republican ticket because we did so the year before or because the Republican platform contains a declaration of principle, no matter how vague, which awakens profound emotional response in us, or because our neighbor whom we do not like happens to be a Democrat. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	“For the most part we do not first see and then define, we define first and then see. In the great booming, buzzing confusion of the outer world we pick out of the clutter what is already defined for us, and we tend to perceive that which we have picked out in the form stereotyped for us by our culture.” (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)
	•	The suggestibility of people to ideas which are part of the standards of their groups could not be more succinctly expressed than in the old command, "When in Rome do as the Romans." (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)

Superpower
	•	superpowers have such wide-ranging interests, and such massive capabilities, that they can conduct their rivalries over the whole planet. (Buzan and Wæver, 2003)
	•	Superpowers by definition largely transcend the logic of geography and adjacency in their security relationships. (Buzan and Wæver, 2003)
Surprise
	•	‘Surprise’ results from the difference between expectations of what will happen, and what actually happens. It can be caused by the realization of a risk that was known and understood, or by events that were not known to be likely or even possible beforehand. (Frühling, 2014)
	•	Surprise may be defined as ‘the occurrence of an unexpected event, or alternatively, the non-occurrence of an expected event’ . (Kahana, 2002)
	•	Surprise is almost always a matter of degree. (Betts, 2007)
	•	when there is an unexpected crisis that affects the fabric of everyday life, in particular that inflicted on society by the terrorist for whom surprise is both a tactical device and a strategic weapon. (Omand, 2014)
	•	we can categorize the likelihood of unwelcome surprises as coming in three forms. There are those surprises that can best be described as unique, infrequent Acts of God, that cannot be affected by policy measures, and whose individual occurrence is inherently hard to estimate. Then there are those discrete events whose frequency of occurrence can be rationally influenced by policy measures, such as the risk of terrorist hijack of an aircraft at Heathrow airport with a predicted occurrence that can, at least broadly, be estimated and presented in an alert state. Further security measures to reduce the likelihood can be taken if it is judged cost-effective to reduce the overall risk. And there are those normal events that are the inevitable consequence of living with highly complex interactive systems. (Omand, 2014)
	•	military surprise is usually only temporary. The advantage of surprise comes because the normal rules of war have been suspended in the adversary’s favour so that locally he can have superiority in numbers, equipment, timing or terrain. (Omand, 2014)
	•	Surprises may be at the levelof the state, or may be caused by non-state actors. We may be faced with hostile ideologies, covert action, political manoeuvring against our interests (for example at the United Nations); economic or cyber action; as well as emerging military threats to our allies and partners. (Omand, 2014)
	•	There will be surprises, and the trick is not to be surprised by surprise. (Omand, 2014)
	•	Most analysts of strategic warning agree that we can never eliminate surprise, banish deception, or develop a foolproof system of indicators. (Hopple, 1984)
Surprise management
	•	In the recovery from surprise, and for preparations to manage it, surprise is easiest to deal with if it arises from a known risk, and most difficult if it arises from a situation of ignorance, in combination with a lack of awareness about the possibility of surprise (‘closedexpectations’). (Frühling, 2014)
	•	Preventing surprise through warning of adverse events is a core task and concern of intelligence services. (Frühling, 2014)
	•	Key to reducing the potential for surprise from unexpected sources is to maintain ‘open expectations’ about the possibility that not all risks may yet be known, or that known risks may have been assessed with an incorrect certitude of assessment. (Frühling, 2014)
	•	Abduction takes as its logical point of departure the possible consequences of surprise (the ‘result’), and from that establishes a range of possible causes of defeat orother undesirable events and developments. (Frühling, 2014)
Predictable surprises
	•	“events that take an individual or group by surprise, despite prior awareness of all of the information necessary to anticipate the events and their consequences.” This is a prosecutor’s view of intelligence failure: if the persons, process, or guidelines at fault can be identified and replaced, failure can be prevented. (Betts, 2007)
Military surprise
	•	military surprise is usually only temporary. The advantage of surprise comes because the normal rules of war have been suspended in the adversary’s favour so that locally he can have superiority in numbers, equipment, timing or terrain. (Omand, 2014)
Surprise attack
	•	In his book Surprise Attack, Betts puts forth three propositions thatdefine the parameters of his theoretical argument. First, the key causeof surprise is political failure, not intelligence failure. Secondly, suddenattacks occur in situations of prolonged tension; there have been no significant cases of "bolts from the blue" in the twentieth century. Thirdl the victim's strategic assumptions trigger the critical miscalculations thatproduce surprise. (Hopple, 1984)
Surveillance
	•	Surveillance enables the state to make biographi- cal profiles of the population in order to determine what is likely to be their probable behaviour at some undetermined date. (Coker, 2009)
	•	Surveillance as a form of management takes many forms. (Coker, 2009)
	•	Surveillance has become crucial in obtaining the information that allows the international community to determine the scale of a risk and to shape the risk management strategies necessary to deal with it. (Coker, 2009)
	•	Surveillance is there for a reason: to identify a risk before it goes critical. (Coker, 2009)

Written survey
	•	The written survey (like the postal survey) may ask the same questions but is impersonal, as there is no dialogue between the researcher and the respondent. (Davies et al., 2002)

Personal survey

	•	[…] personal survey with generally gain a higher response rate than a telephone or postal survey, it is more time-consuming and involves more legwork. (Davies et al., 2002)

	•	Sublime, whose Latin root means “up to the threshold.” The Sublime is anything that exceeds our capacity for words or concepts by being too large, too vast, too dark and mysterious. And when we face such things, we feel a touch of fear but also awe and wonder. We are reminded of our smallness, of what is much vaster and more powerful than our puny will. Feeling th eSublime is the perfect antidote to our complacency and to the petty concerns of daily life that can consume us and leave us feeling rather empty. The model for feeling the Sublime comes in our meditation on mortality, but we can train our minds to experience it through other thoughts and actions. For instance, when we look up at the night sky, we can let our minds try to fathom the infinity of space and the overwhelming smallness of our planet, lost in all the darkness. We can encounter the Sublime by thinking about the origin of life on earth, how many billions of years ago this occurred, perhaps at some particular moment, and how unlikely it was, considering the thousands of factors that had to converge for the experiment of life to begin on this planet. Such vast amounts of time and the actual origin of life exceed our capacity to conceptualize them, and we are left with a sensation of the Sublime. (Greene, 2018)
	•	We can experience the Sublime by contemplating other forms of life. We have our own belief about what is real based on our nervous and perceptual systems, but the reality of bats, which perceive through echolocation, is of a different order. They sense things beyond our perceptual system. What are the other elements we cannot perceive, the other realities invisible to us? (The latest discoveries in most branches of science will have this eye-opening effect, and reading articles in any popular scientific journal will generally yield a few sublime thoughts.) (Greene, 2018)
	•	In the face of the Sublime, we feel a shiver, a foretaste of death itself, something too large for our minds to encompass. (Greene, 2018)
Submission
	•	People’s actions will often contain dominance and submission cues. (Greene, 2018)
Substitution principle
	•	The substitution principle is a surprisingly under researched regulatory tool that has grown in popularity over the past twenty years especially within the chemical control area. It has its roots firmly in Swedish regulatory policy and over the past few years it has been widely promoted by a number of regulators (most notably the Swedish Chemicals Agency), environmental NGOs (such as the International Chemicals Secretariat and the European Environmental Bureau), as well as academics and most recently the European Commission and the European Parliament. (Lofstedt, 2014)
	•	The substitution principle is one of the building blocks of modern day chemical regulation as highlighted in the registration, evaluation, authorisation and restric- tion of chemicals regulation. (Lofstedt, 2014)
	•	the substitution principle is surprisingly under researched topic and that there is no clear consensus on how to best apply the principle. (Lofstedt, 2014)
	•	The substitution principle is one of the building blocks of modern day chemical regulation as highlighted in the 2001 European Commission Chemical White Paper (European Commission 2001; see also Greenpeace 2005 for a discussion). It is regarded as a cornerstone principle of the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) regulation. Article 62 sets out that any application for an authorisation must, as part of its documentation, have a thorough analysis of the alternatives (European Council 2006/1907; UK Royal Society of Chemistry 2007). (Lofstedt, 2014)
	•	The substitution principle (this time under the guise of Best Available Technology) is also an integral part of the Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control directive, and it is referred to in the 2002/95 Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment (RoHS) Directive (Swedish Chemicals Agency 2008a). (Lofstedt, 2014)
	•	substitution is not a ‘new’ risk management tool, but rather a well-established one that has long been part of the wider economic innovative process. (Lofstedt, 2014)
	•	The first legal use of the term ‘substitution principle’ was the 1949 law on worker’s health and safety in Sweden (Nilsson 1997, 2007). (Lofstedt, 2014)
	•	Although the substitution principle has been used in some shape or form for more than 60 years, there is no clear definition of the principle, a fate it shares with the precautionary principle (e.g. Sandin 1999). (Lofstedt, 2014)
	•	Views on the use of the substitution principle come from a number of different perspectives. (Lofstedt, 2014)
	•	Substitution is preferable when it offers attractive benefits (relative to costs and risks) compared to the next-best alternative measure. (Abelkop and Graham, 2014)
	•	Substitution is preferable when it offers attractive benefits (relative to costs and risks) compared to the next-best alternative measure. Depending on the nature of the market failure and the cost-effectiveness of alternative measures, chemical replacement may or may not be the preferred remedy. (Abelkop and Graham, 2014)
	•	the principle of substitution, like its close cousin precaution, is a guideline for consideration by decision-makers rather than a policy tool. (Abelkop and Graham, 2014)
	•	Confusion can arise when the principle of substitution is treated as if it is an operational tool. (Abelkop and Graham, 2014)
	•	Precaution and substitution are principles that offer some insight for regulators (just as cost-benefit and risk-risk comparison can offer insight); but they are not operational policy tools that regulators can deploy. (Abelkop and Graham, 2014)
	•	The substitution principle, as it is beginning to be used in Europe, is intuitively appealing. (Dudley, 2014)
	•	Any application of the substitution principle that relies on hazard rather than risk is bound to result in unintended consequences, including the risk increases revealed (Dudley, 2014)
	•	The substitution principle fails the epistemic humility principle by assuming that policy-makers can determine, ex ante, what products will yield superior health outcomes without negative consequences. Basing substitution decisions on limited information (hazards vs. risks, for example) exacerbates this problem. (Dudley, 2014)
	•	The best use of the substitution principle may be to help everyone understand the complexity of risk management decisions, and why they should very rarely be made by regulators. (Dudley, 2014)
	•	the substitution principle – put simply as the substitution of products with safer alternatives. (Girling, 2014)
	•	Substitution of dangerous substances by less dangerous ones has become an important objective in the EU chemicals policy. (Öberg, 2014)
	•	A substitution may reduce a known risk or hazard but the substance or process that is used as replacement produces other (health or environmental) risks that were not taken into account. (Renn, 2014)
	•	A substitution may reduce a known risk or hazard but the substance or process that is used as a replacement consists of ingredients or is part of a product chain that includes larger uncertainties about potential risks. (Renn, 2014)
	•	A substitution may reduce a known risk to a marginal extent on the expense of great economic or social expenses (cost of conversion, changes in product chain or simply price of the product or service). (Renn, 2014)
	•	A substitution may reduce a known risk but has major impacts on the entire industry, the product chain or other essential services. (Renn, 2014)
	•	We propose to define the substitution principle as follows: If risks to the environment and human health and safety can be reduced by replacing a chemical substance or product either by another substance or by some non-chemical technology, then this replacement should take place. All decisions on such substitutions should be based on the best available evidence. This evidence can be sufficient to warrant a substitution even if quantitative risk estimates cannot be made. (Swedish Chemicals Agency et al., 2007)
	•	The substitution principle should not be understood as an absolute principle but as an efficient first-hand method to achieve the goals of chemicals risk management. The responsibility for achieving these goals, which is often best done by rigorously applying the substitution principle, rests primarily on the companies that produce and use chemical substances. (Swedish Chemicals Agency et al., 2007)
	•	The substitution principle is an application of the principle of inherent safety, that has been developed in the chemical industry. (Swedish Chemicals Agency et al., 2007)
	•	The need to make decisions on incomplete information also includes decisions on substitution. Thus, if we have good reasons to believe that a substance is more dangerous than its alternatives, then we should avoid using that substance, even if the good reasons do not amount to full scientific proof. (Swedish Chemicals Agency et al., 2007)
	•	Public decisions on specific substitutions have to be reserved for special cases. (Swedish Chemicals Agency et al., 2007)
	•	By systematically evaluating the effects of various substitution-promoting measures undertaken by public agencies, we can learn which methods are the most effective ones. (Swedish Chemicals Agency et al., 2007)
	•	In order to apply the substitution principle, knowledge and competences are needed that the chemical industry has to a much higher degree than most of their customers. (Swedish Chemicals Agency et al., 2007)
	•	To substitute (latin: substituere) means to replace, or to “put (one) in place of another” (OED). (Swedish Chemicals Agency et al., 2007)
	•	In chemicals regulation and risk management, by the substitution principle is meant a policy principle that requires the replacement of hazardous (or potentially hazardous) chemical substances by less hazardous alternatives. A less common synonym is the product choice principle. (Swedish Chemicals Agency et al., 2007)
	•	The substitution principle has been discussed in different regulatory and risk management contexts. It has also been the subject of heated debates. Not surprisingly, it has been interpreted differently by various groups of appliers, proponents and opponents. (Swedish Chemicals Agency et al., 2007)
	•	we mean by the substitution principle, at least the following five aspects have to be specified. the purpose of substitution; whether the substitution is chemical or functional–; the required functionality of the substitute; whether substances or products are substituted– whether substitution is based on hazard or risk. (Swedish Chemicals Agency et al., 2007)
	•	In most of the literature on the substitution principle, the motive of substitution is taken to be that the substance is “hazardous”, without further specification. (Swedish Chemicals Agency et al., 2007)
	•	Since the substitution principle is part of environmental policies, the substitutions that it refers to have motives related to the environment and to human health. (Swedish Chemicals Agency et al., 2007)
	•	substitutions that aim at improving workplace health and safety should be included. (Swedish Chemicals Agency et al., 2007)
	•	the substitution principle refers to all the dangers to human health and the environment that may be associated with the use of a chemical. (Swedish Chemicals Agency et al., 2007)
	•	Some definitions of the substitution principle specify it as requiring the replacement of a (hazardous) chemical substance by another (less hazardous) chemical substance. (Swedish Chemicals Agency et al., 2007)
	•	“substitution” in the context of the substitution principle use this word as an abbreviation of “substitution that complies with the substitution principle”. (Swedish Chemicals Agency et al., 2007)
	•	Most definitions of the substitution principle take this into account, and allow for substitution by non-chemical means:“Informed substitution is the considered transition from a chemical of particular concern to safer chemicals or non-chemical alternatives.” (Swedish Chemicals Agency et al., 2007)
	•	“Substitution means the replacement or reduction of hazardous substances in products and processes by less hazardous or non-hazardous substances, or by achieving an equivalent functionality via technological or organisational measures.” (Swedish Chemicals Agency et al., 2007)
	•	“Substitution of a hazardous substance or product signifies its replacement by less a hazardous substance, product or process.” (Swedish Chemicals Agency et al., 2007)
	•	it is obvious given the purpose of the substitution principle, that it should be interpreted as promoting the substitution of the use of a hazardous chemical by some (chemical or non-chemical) method that reduces potential for damage to health or the environment. (Swedish Chemicals Agency et al., 2007)
	•	the substitution principle should be understood as referring to functional replacement, not chemical replacement. (Swedish Chemicals Agency et al., 2007)
	•	the application of the principle, the intended function of the original chemical cannot always have absolute priority over protection of health and the environment. (Swedish Chemicals Agency et al., 2007)
	•	a recent influential definition of the substitution principle requires that the substitute satisfies the functional requirements to the same degree as the original chemical:“Substitution means the replacement or reduction of hazardous substances in products and processes by less hazardous or non-hazardous substances, or by achieving an equivalent functionality via technological or organisational measures.” (Swedish Chemicals Agency et al., 2007)
	•	the substitution principle should be seen as a principle that requires the replacement of dangerous substances by less dangerous alternatives, while attempting to (i) reduce the danger as much as possible, (ii) retain (or in principle increase) the functionality that the original substance had as much as possible, and (iii) keep costs as low as possible. The priority between these three objectives is a matter for negotiation and adjustment in each particular case, and cannot be settled beforehand by requiring that one of these objectives always has absolute priority over the others. (Swedish Chemicals Agency et al., 2007)
	•	In practice, substitution can refer either to chemical substances or to chemical products (i.e. commercial mixtures). (Swedish Chemicals Agency et al., 2007)
	•	Substitution based on hazard can be general, i.e. apply to many or all uses of a substance, and does not require detailed assessments of the particular circumstances under which the substance is used in individual companies. (Swedish Chemicals Agency et al., 2007)
	•	When we know the risk, then substitution decisions should be based on the risk. (Swedish Chemicals Agency et al., 2007)
	•	hazard-based substitutions can contribute to reducing risks. (Swedish Chemicals Agency et al., 2007)
	•	the substitution principle should be based on the best available evidence. (Swedish Chemicals Agency et al., 2007)
	•	The substitution principle should not be understood as an absolute principle but as an efficient first-hand method to achieve the goals of chemicals risk management. The responsibility for achieving these goals, which is often best done by rigorously applying the substitution principle, rests primarily on the companies that produce and use chemical substances. (Swedish Chemicals Agency et al., 2007)
	•	The substitution principle can be described as a strategy in safety engineering, namely the strategy that favours the former of these alternatives. (Swedish Chemicals Agency et al., 2007)
	•	the substitution principle is an instance or a special case of the principle of inherent safety, that has a strong tradition in the chemical industry’s management of its own plants. (Swedish Chemicals Agency et al., 2007)
	•	Traditionally, four types of safety measures are recommended in inherently safer design of plants:minimize (intensify): use smaller quantities of hazardous materialssubstitute: replace a hazardous material by a less hazardous oneattenuate (moderate): use the hazardous material in a less hazardous formsimplify: avoid unnecessary complexity in facilities and processes, in order to make operating errors less likely. (Swedish Chemicals Agency et al., 2007)
	•	the substitution principle is part of a general safety engineering tradition that strives to avoid uncertainty. As we noted there, this tradition requires that even apparently well-controlled hazards should be removed or reduced if possible. The reason for this is that uncertainty can never be abolished, in other words that absolute safety in the control of a chemical hazard is not achievable. If the substitution principle is interpreted in this way, it includes an application of cautious decision-making. (Swedish Chemicals Agency et al., 2007)
	•	the substitution principle primarily concerns preference for one particular form of such protective action. (Swedish Chemicals Agency et al., 2007)
	•	Substitution should not be seen as a single decision but as a continuous development towards safer processes. (Swedish Chemicals Agency et al., 2007)
	•	Decisions to substitute can be taken at different levels of organization from the primary producer of a product, deciding on which products to manufacture and on the production processes and composition of those products, to the users of the products that may substitute one product or process for another. (Swedish Chemicals Agency et al., 2007)
	•	for the substitution principle to be efficiently implemented, regulators and public authorities have to take the lead. (Swedish Chemicals Agency et al., 2007)
Suffer
	•	je souffre moins, parce qu'il y a en moi moins de force pour souffrir. (Dumas, 1998)
Sufrage
Universal sufrage
	•	Le dogme du suffrage universel possède aujourd'hui le pouvoir qu'eurent jadis les dogmes chrétiens. Orateurs et écrivains en parlent avec un respect et des adulations que n'a pas connus Louis XIV. Il faut donc se conduire à son égard comme à l'égard de tous les dogmes religieux. Le temps seul agit sur eux. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Il serait d'ailleurs d'autant plus inutile d'essayer d'ébranler ce dogme qu'il a des raisons apparentes pour lui: «Dans les temps d'égalité, dit justement Tocqueville, les hommes n'ont aucune foi les uns dans les autres, à cause de leur similitude; mais cette même similitude leur donne une confiance presque illimitée dans le jugement du public; car il ne leur paraît pas vraisemblable, qu'ayant tous des lumières pareilles, la vérité ne se rencontre pas du côté du plus grand nombre.» (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Et c'est ainsi qu'une fois encore nous retombons sur cette notion fondamentale de race, déjà rencontrée si souvent, et sur cette autre notion, qui découle de la première que les institutions et les gouvernements ne jouent qu'un rôle insignifiant dans la vie des peuples. Ces derniers sont surtout conduits par l'âme de leur race, c'est-à-dire par les résidus ancestraux dont cette âme est la somme. La race et l'engrenage des nécessités de chaque jour, tels sont les maîtres mystérieux qui régissent nos destinées. (Lebon, 1895)
Sunset
	•	peu à peu l'ombre monta de la mer et sembla chasser devant elle ce dernier reflet du jour qui allait s'éteindre, enfin le rayon lumineux fut repoussé jusqu'à la cime du cône, où il s'arrêta un instant comme le panache enflammé d'un volcan : enfin l'ombre, toujours ascendante, envahit progressivement le sommet, comme elle avait envahi la base, et l'île n'apparut plus que comme une montagne grise qui allait toujours se rembrunissant. Une demi-heure après, il faisait nuit noire. (Dumas, 1998)
Sustainability
	•	It is also a conception which requires that social responsibility movements which hold other organizations to account must themselves become more business-like in their oper- ations, adopting the very same risk management tropes as the organizations with which they seek to engage and criticize. (Power, 2009)
Symbol
Greek symbol
	•	Greek symbols are often used to clearly distinguish parameters from state variables. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
Symmetry
	•	Symmetry is an immensely important concept. A fascination with symmetric forms seems to be an innate feature of human perception, and for millennia it has influenced art and natural philosophy. More recently, symmetry has become indispensable in mathematics and science, where its applications range from atomic physics to zoology. Einstein’s principle that the laws of Nature should be the same at all locations and all times, which forms the basis for fundamental physics, requires those laws to possess corresponding symmetries. But for thousands of years, the concept of symmetry was just an informal description of regularities of shape and structure. (Stewart, 2013)
	•	sometimes the word was invoked in a metaphorical sense: for example, that in social disputes, both sides should be treated in the same way. (Stewart, 2013)
	•	An algebraic formula has symmetry if some of its variables can be interchanged without altering its value. (Stewart, 2013)
	•	What emerged was a new algebraic concept: a group of permutations. (Stewart, 2013)
	•	My aim is to discuss the historical origins of symmetry, some of its key mathematical features, its relevance to patterns in the natural world, including living organisms, and its applications to pattern formation and fundamental physics. (Stewart, 2013)
	•	objects do not have symmetry: they have symmetries. These are transformations that leave the object unchanged. (Stewart, 2013)
	•	Equipped with a refined understanding of symmetry, we examine how Nature’s patterns, especially familiar ones from everyday life, can be described and explained through symmetry. (Stewart, 2013)
	•	symmetry need not be related to anything visual. (Stewart, 2013)
	•	symmetries of various kinds arise naturally in mathematics and the world around us. (Stewart, 2013)
	•	symmetry can be a shape (circles, waves), an abstract structure (rock–paper–scissors), or a reflection (bridge of asses). The physical implications of symmetry can apply to space, to time, to both in combination, or to more abstract notions such as probability or a matrix. (Stewart, 2013)
	•	What I’ve not yet explained is what symmetry is. The diversity of contexts in which the word seems applicable suggests that a precise definition could be elusive. (Stewart, 2013)
	•	A symmetry of some mathematical structure is a transformation of that structure, of a specified kind, that leaves specified properties of the structure unchanged. There is one technical condition: only invertible transformations, ones that can be inverted (reversed), are permitted. So we can’t squash the entire circle down to a single point, for instance. Rotations are invertible: the inverse of rotation by α is rotation by −α; that is, through the same angle, but in the opposite direction. (Stewart, 2013)
	•	a given shape may have many different symmetries. So instead of considering individual symmetries, we need to think about them all. (Stewart, 2013)
	•	We say that the set of all symmetries of a given shape or structure forms a group. Accordingly, we rename this set the symmetry group of the shape or structure. It turns out that if you know the symmetry group, you can infer all sorts of things about the shape or structure. (Stewart, 2013)
	•	Symmetries can be found in art, culture, the natural world, science, and mathematics, and their appeal seems to go to the roots of human perception. Religious and secular symbols are often symmetric, and today the same is true of some company logos. (Stewart, 2013)
	•	A bold, simple, symmetric design seems to have a powerful effect on the human psyche. Artists have explored symmetric patterns in remarkable depth and detail. Architects have employed a variety of symmetries to design elegant buildings. Symmetry in the natural world has fascinated natural historians and scientists since the time of Aristotle. (Stewart, 2013)
	•	dissymmetry principle: an effect cannot have a dissymmetry absent from its cause. Dissymmetry is lack of symmetry, so we can rephrase this as ‘The symmetry of the causes must be reproduced in the effects.’ (Stewart, 2013)
	•	A rigorous definition of symmetry emerged from none of these areas. Instead, it came from pure mathematics, with the concept of a group of transformations. (Stewart, 2013)
	•	Symmetries are widespread in the natural world, and they have a strong appeal to our innate sense of pattern. (Stewart, 2013)
	•	The idealized Nautilus is not symmetric under rotation, and it is not symmetric under dilation either. However, it is symmetric under a suitable combination of them: rotate by f and dilate by e−kϕ. Indeed, this is a symmetry for any. (Stewart, 2013)
	•	Mathematical symmetry is an idealized model. (Stewart, 2013)
	•	The symmetry of a living creature affects not just its shape, but how it moves. (Stewart, 2013)
	•	Like all periodic motions, gaits have time-translation symmetry: change phase by any integer number of cycles. (Stewart, 2013)
	•	One of the most intriguing features of the laws of Nature, as we understand them, is that they are symmetric. As we saw in the previous chapter, symmetry of the equations (laws) need not imply symmetry of the behaviour (solutions). (Stewart, 2013)
	•	The story of symmetry, the mathematics that it led to, and the uses to which the resulting theories have been put, show how simple but deep concepts can lead to immensely powerful theories and major scientific advances. (Stewart, 2013)
Symmetry-breaking 
	•	Symmetry-breaking also plays an important role in the development of multi-celled organisms and, indeed, in complex systems in general. (Holland, 2014)
Symmetry group
	•	a symmetry group consists of transformations that preserve certain structure. (Stewart, 2013)
	•	The simplest such symmetry group consists of combinations of the two translations, and a typical pattern is shown in Figure 18 (left). To avoid confusion, it is important to appreciate that the pattern in Figure 18 (right) does not have additional rotational symmetries. A single star has extra symmetries, but when you apply them to the whole pattern, other stars don’t map correctly. However, the pattern is now symmetric under reflection in the vertical bisector of any star, a new symmetry that the donkey paper lacks. (Stewart, 2013)
	•	These symmetry properties allow us to compute the number of symmetries that each regular solid possesses; that is, the order of its symmetry group. (Stewart, 2013)
Synchrony
	•	Perhaps the best and most exciting sign of all is synchrony, the other person unconsciously mirroring you. Their legs cross in the same direction, the head tilts in a similar manner, one smile inducing another. At the deepest level of synchrony, as Milton Erickson discovered, you will find breathing patterns falling into the same rhythm, which can sometimes end in the complete synchrony of a kiss. (Greene, 2018)
Syndrom
Grass-is-always-greener syndrome
	•	By nature, we humans are not easily contented with our circumstances. By some perverse force within us, the moment we possess something or get what we want, our minds begin to drift toward something new and different, to imagine we can have better. The more distant and unattainable this new object, the greater is our desire to have it. We can call this the grass-is-always-greener syndrome, the psychological equivalent of an optical illusion—if we get too close to the grass, to that new object, we see that is not really so green after all. (Greene, 2018)
	•	This syndrome has very deep roots in our nature. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Whatever they had, they dreamed of something better over the horizon. (Greene, 2018)
	•	often when we act on these desires, we realize this in our disappointment, but it doesn’t change our behavior. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Such a syndrome can be explained by three qualities of the human brain. (Greene, 2018)
	•	The first is known as induction, how something positive generates a contrasting negative image in our mind. This is most obvious in our visual system. When we see some color—red or black, for instance—it tends to intensify our perception of the opposite color around us, in this case green or white. As we look at the red object, we often can see a green halo forming around it. In general, the mind operates by contrasts. We are able to formulate concepts about something by becoming aware of its opposite. The brain is continually dredging up these contrasts. (Greene, 2018)
	•	What this means is that whenever we see or imagine something, our minds cannot help but see or imagine the opposite. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Second, complacency would be a dangerous evolutionary trait for a conscious animal such as humans. If our early ancestors had been prone to feeling content with present circumstances, they would not have been sensitive enough to possible dangers that lurked in the most apparently safe environments. We survived and thrived through our continual conscious alertness, which predisposed us to thinking and imagining the possible negative in any circumstance. We no longer live in savannas or forests teeming with life-threatening predators and natural dangers, but our brains are wired as if we were. We are inclined therefore toward a continual negative bias, which often consciously is expressed through complaining and griping. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Finally, what is real and what is imagined are both experienced similarly in the brain. This has been demonstrated through various experiments in which subjects who imagine something produce electrical and chemical activity in their brains that is remarkably similar to when they actually live out what they are imagining, all of this shown through functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Reality can be quite harsh and is full of limits and problems. We all must die. Every day we get older and less strong. To become successful requires sacrifice and hard work. But in our imagination we can voyage beyond these limits and entertain all kinds of possibilities. Our imagination is essentially limitless. And what we imagine has almost the force of what we actually experience. And so we become creatures who are continually prone to imagining something better than present circumstances and feeling some pleasure in the release from reality that our imagination brings us. (Greene, 2018)
	•	All of this makes the grass-is-always-greener syndrome inevitable in our psychological makeup. We should not moralize or complain about this possible flaw in human nature. It is a part of the mental life of each one of us, and it has many benefits. It is the source of our ability to think of new possibilities and innovate. It is what has made our imagination such a powerful instrument. And on the flip side it is the material out of which we can move, excite, and seduce people. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Our path must always be toward greater awareness of our nature. We must see within ourselves the grass-is-always-greener syndrome at work and how it continually impels us to certain actions. We need to be able to distinguish between what is positive and productive in our covetous tendencies and what is negative and counterproductive. On the positive side, feeling restless and discontented can motivate us to search for something better and to not settle for what we have. It enlarges our imagination as we consider other possibilities instead of the circumstances we face. As we get older, we tend to become more complacent, and renewing the restlessness of our earlier years can keep us youthful and our minds active.This restlessness, however, must be under conscious control. Often our discontent is merely chronic; our desire for change is vague and a reflection of our boredom. This leads to a waste of precious time. We are unhappy with the way our career is going and so we make a big change, which requires learning new skills and acquiring new contacts. We enjoy the newness of it all. But several years later we again feel the stirring of discontent. This new path isn’t right either. We would have been better off thinking about this more deeply, homing in on those aspects of our previous career that did not click and trying for a more gentle change, choosing a line of work related to the previous one but requiring an adaptation of our skills. (Greene, 2018)

Syntax
	•	The most fundamental tenet of Generative Grammar is that there is a level of linguistic description, namely, syntax, that is independent of all other levels of linguistic description including semantics and independent of all other aspects of cognition as well. (Tomasello, 1998)
	•	This Autonomy of Syntax thesis is not an empirical discovery or even a hypothesis that is ever explicitly tested. It is a paradigm-defining definitional postulate that is a direct result of taking a mathematical approach to natural language. (Tomasello, 1998)
System
	•	Systems are divided into four levels of increasing aggregation: units, parts, subsystems, and system. (Perrow, 1999)
	•	systems can benefit from unexpected interactions of nonfailure events (Perrow, 1999)
Complex systems
	•	Complex systems tend to have elaborate control centers not because they make life easier for the operators, saving steps or time, nor because there is necessarily more machinery to control, but because components must interact in more than linear, sequential ways, and therefore may interact in unexpected ways (Perrow, 1999)
	•	the information about the state of components or processes is more indirect and inferential in complex systems. (Perrow, 1999)
	•	To summarize, complex systems are characterized by: Proximity of parts or units that are not in a production sequence; many common mode connections between components (parts, units, or subsystems) not in a production sequence; unfamiliar or unintended feedback loops; many control parameters with potential interactions; indirect or inferential information sources; and 
limited understanding of some processes. (Perrow, 1999) 
	•	Complex systems are not necessarily high-risk systems with catastrophic potential; universities, research and development firms, and some government bureaucracies are complex systems (Perrow, 1999)
	•	In complex systems, removing a component or shutting it down means temporarily severing numerous ties with consequent readjustments, capping, product storage, removal to get access, and re-configurations because parts and units tend to be multiply linked. (Perrow, 1999)

	•	A complex system, such as a nuclear reactor or a human body, will malfunction if any of its essential components fails. (Tversky and Kahneman, 1974)
	•	As is true of most systems, there are important questions about complex systems that cannot be answered by observation alone. (Holland, 2014)
Generated system
	•	a typical generated system the parts are put together in an interconnected, non-additive way. (Holland, 2014)
	•	a generated system consists of a set of generators (essentially an alphabet) and a set of operators (a set of rules for combining letters from the alphabet to form legitimate ‘sentenses’). (Holland, 2014)
High-risk system
	•	The question of what is to be done about our high-risk systems depends upon what we think the problem is. (Perrow, 1999)
	•	This suggests that in designing or redesigning high-risk systems, we need to consider not only the technology but the role of a variety of groups, including types of victims, and the true long-run social and economic costs, or externalities. (Perrow, 1999)
Linear systems
	•	Linear systems lack the common-mode connections that require proximity 

	•	Linear systems not only have spatial segregation of separate phases of production, but within production sequences the links are few and sequential, allowing damaged components to be pulled out with minimal disturbance to the rest of the system. 

	•	Linear systems also favor serial production—a series of linked but semi-independent production steps—rather than what organizational theorist James Thompson calls "pooled interdependence," where all components (including operators) must coordinate their input if the system is to function at all. (Perrow, 1999)

	•	In contrast to complex systems, there is minimal specialization of labor, materials, and pools of supply in linear systems. (Perrow, 1999)
	•	Substitutions are more likely in linear systems. (Perrow, 1999)
	•	Finally, linear systems have minimal feedback loops, and thus less opportunity to baffle designers or operators. There are fewer interactions of control parameters, because controls are more decentralized, and at- tached to special-purpose equipment. And the information used to run the system is more likely to be directly received, and to reflect actual operations. (Perrow, 1999)
	•	Complex systems are more efficient (in the narrow terms of production efficiency, which neglects accident hazards) than linear systems. There is less slack, less underutilized space, less tolerance of low-quality performance, and more multifunction components. From this point of view, for design and hardware efficiency, complexity is desirable. (Perrow, 1999)
	•	Some complex systems can be redesigned to be more linear, such as in air traffic control or with the substitution of jet engines for the very interactive piston engines. (Perrow, 1999)
	•	we have complex systems because we don't know how to produce the output through linear systems. If these complex systems also have catastrophic potential, then we had better consider alternative ways of getting the product, or abandoning the product entirely. (Perrow, 1999)
	•	Complexity is inherent in some forms of production. (Perrow, 1999)
	•	If the system is linear, rather than complexly interactive, tight coupling appears to be the optimum mode of organization. (Perrow, 1999)

Resilient system
	•	A resilient system, writes Homer-Dixon, can absorb large disturbances without changing its fundamental behaviour. (Coker, 2009)
	•	For the resilience of a system is an ‘emergent property’ too (i.e. it is not the result of any one of the system’s parts, but of the synergy between them). (Coker, 2009)
System Approach
	•	An alternative systems approach to safety in described, which avoids the limitations of NAT and HRO (Marais et al., 2004)
	•	a systems approach to safety will allow building safety into socio-technical systems more effectively and provide higher confidence than is currently possible for complex, high-risk systems. (Marais et al., 2004)
System state
	•	The state S(t) of a system at time t summarizes the results of activity in the system prior to time t; usually this is done in a way that makes it possible to predict future possibilities knowing just the information provided by the state. (Holland, 2014)
System-sustaining effect
	•	system-sustaining effects that follow from initial decisions in favour of one type of organization rather than another. This is the nub of the argument: institutions stand on different forking paths of decision trees. Once embarked on one path, it is difficult to get back to the choice that would have led another way (Douglas, 2005:136)
T
Table of content
	•	A table of contents (ToC) is like a map needed for a trip never taken before. You need to have a sense of the journey before embarking on it. A map provides a visual proxy for the actual travel with details about the landmarks that you will pass by in your trip. The ToC with main headings and lists of tables and figures offers a glimpse of what lies ahead in the document. Never shy away from including a ToC, especially if your document, excluding cover page, table of contents, and references, is five or more pages in length. (Haider, 2016)
Tactics
Military tactic
	•	Tactics are the science of the movements made within sight of the enemy, and within reach of his artillery. (Bülow and Martemont, 1806)
Tactical indicators
	•	Tactical indicators are specific reports of preparations or intent to initiate hostile action. (Heuer, 1999)
Tactical thinking
	•	Our minds are designed for strategic thinking—calculating several moves in advance toward our goals. (Greene, 2018)
Talent 
	•	It is always better to praise people for their effort, not their talent. (Greene, 2018)
Natural talent 
	•	Natural talent or a high IQ cannot explain future achievement. (Greene, 2014)
Target
	•	A target is the object of a risk or plan. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Target are attractice to threats. (Newsome, 2013)
Target identification
	•	Identifying targets is a key step in assessing the risks associated with certain threats. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Analytically, no threat should be identified except in relation to a particular target. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Target can be identified by their attractiveness to threats and by their risk factors or indicators. (Newsome, 2013)
Target priority
	•	The highest priority targets for the Security Service will feature with the same priority in the overall national intelligence requirements. (Omand, 2014)
Target selection
	•	target selection is the result of a fixation the attacker has with the target. (Stewart, 2020)
Taxonomic scheme
	•	A taxonomic scheme might explain, for example, people's extreme aversion to some hazards, their indifference to others, and the discrepancies between these reactions and opinions of experts. (Slovic, 1987)
Teach
	•	The teaching procedures both shape the 'appearance' or the 'phenomenon' and establish a firm connection with words, so that finally the phenomena seem to speak for themselves, without outside help or extraneous knowledge. They just are what the associated statements assert them to be. (Feyerabend, 1993)
Team
	•	Teams are increasingly becoming an essential component of organizations across industries. (Gupta, 2009)
	•	Polzer (2003) argued that teams are ideal for performing tasks that combine high complexity and high interdependence. (Gupta, 2009)
	•	Team are considered as the best way to lead diverse set of people to better outputs. (Gupta, 2009)
	•	Team approach is an answer to today’s many complex problems. (Gupta, 2009)
	•	There are studies reporting the usefulness of teams in terms of resulting into better outputs. (Gupta, 2009)
	•	The term ‘team’ has been defined differently by various people. (Gupta, 2009)
	•	“Teams are collections of people who must rely on group collaboration if each member is to experience the optimum of success and goal achievement” (Dyer, 1977, p.4). (Gupta, 2009)
	•	Mohrman, Cohen and Mohrman (1995) defined a team as “a group of individuals who works together to produce producs or deliver services for which they are mutually accountable” (Gupta, 2009)
	•	According to Huszczo (1996), “The most generic definition of a team emphasizes that it is two or more people interacting together to accomplish a common purpose”. (Gupta, 2009)
	•	Donnellon (1996) defined team as “a group of people who are necessary to accomplish a task that required the continuous integration of the expertise distributed among them”. (Gupta, 2009)
	•	According to Larson and LaFasto (1989), “A team has two or more people; it has a specific performance objective or recognizable goal to be attained; and coordination of activity among the members of the team is required for the attainment of the team foal or objective”. (Gupta, 2009)
	•	An aspect that team has a common goal is emphasized by various scholars. (Gupta, 2009)
	•	The researchers in the recent times have started viewing groups and teams as complex, adaptive, and dynamic systems.
	•	Many scholars seemed to have used the words ‘team’ and ‘group’ or ‘work group’ interchangeably. (Gupta, 2009)
	•	Rather than having a clean demarcation, teams and groups lie along a continuum that consists of the amount of interdependence among the people (Polzer, 2003). (Gupta, 2009)
	•	A close look at these definitions indicates that the word ‘group’ is a part of the definition of ‘team’. (Gupta, 2009)
	•	Team is a group. (Gupta, 2009)
	•	The team has to have a common goal and the members of team depend on each other for the achievement of that goal. (Gupta, 2009)
	•	Team is a group which has a common purpose or goal – it could be anything from developing a product or idea to executing an idea or strategy or becoming a market leader or winning a match – and to achieve this common goal, members need each other and are dependent on each other for skills, expertise, knozledge, support, etc. (Gupta, 2009)
	•	There may be different types of teams depending on the purpose or nature of task for which the team is established. (Gupta, 2009)
	•	Some teams may be relatively permanent such as departmental teams whereas others are temporary that last as long as necessary to accomplish a particular task such as task forces, etc. (Gupta, 2009)
	•	The purpose for which the team was formed may be an important aspect in determining the tenure of team. (Gupta, 2009)
	•	Whether a team would lead to synergy or negative outcomes leargely depends on the way it is managed. (Gupta, 2009)

Teamwork
	•	the following definition for teamwork in the health care context: “A dynamic process involving two or more health professionals with complementary backgrounds and skills, sharing common health goals and exercising concerted physical and mental effort in assessing, planning, or evaluating patient care. This is accomplished through interdependent collaboration, open communication and shared decision-making. This in turn generates value-added patient, organisational and staff outcomes.”(p.238). (Nancarrow et al., 2013)
	•	Donnellon (1996) emphasized that the teamwork is the most effective way to accomplish tasks that require integration of diverse expertise and experiences. (Gupta, 2009)
	•	Even if one agrees that teamwork is of utmost importance, teams may not be required in each and every situation. (Gupta, 2009)
	•	According to Donnellon (1996), team work is paradoxical as it requires differentiation among members and integration of members into a single working unit. (Gupta, 2009)
	•	The comprehension of opposition of differentiation and integration in team work and learning to manage the tension is necessary for team work but it may not be sufficient since teams create a number of other paradoxes for team members such as the paradox of individuality, the paradox of identity, the paradox of interdependence, and the paradox of trust. (Gupta, 2009)
	•	Willingness to work together is an important element of teamwork. While forming a team, someone who is approached to join team has to have willingness to join the team. Not only willingness of the person bein approached to join a team but also willingness of already existing members to work with the next entrant is important. (Gupta, 2009)
	•	Teamwork in organizations is highly valued. (Gupta, 2009)
	•	Teamwork may not be needed in each and every situation, and for each type of task in organizations. Identifying what tasks can best be accomplished by teamwork is critical. (Gupta, 2009)
	•	We suggest that contextual performance (i.e. individual-level behavior that supports the social, organizational, and psychological environment in which task behaviors are performed) underlies teamwork, and task performance (i.e. individual-level behavior focused directly or in support of task accomplishment) underlies taskwork. (LePine et al., 2000)

Interdisciplinary teamwork
	•	Interdisciplinary team work is increasingly prevalent, supported by policies and practices that bring care closer to the patient and challenge traditional professional boundaries. To date, there has been a great deal of emphasis on the processes of team work, and in some cases, outcomes. (Nancarrow et al., 2013)
	•	Interdisciplinary team work is increasingly prevalent, supported by policies and practices that bringcare closer to the patient and challenge traditional professional boundaries. (Nancarrow et al., 2013)
	•	Interdisciplinary team work is a complex process inwhich different types of staff work together to share expertise, knowledge, and skills to impact on patient care. (Nancarrow et al., 2013)
	•	interdisciplinary team work tend tofocus on specifics of team work activities such as: shar-ing of patient files [3], case-conferencing approaches[4,5], or meeting style or frequency [6-10]. (Nancarrow et al., 2013)
	•	The term “interdisciplinary team” is used as a generic term of reference for these healthcare teams which included a range of health service workers, both professionals and non-professionals, with the majority being from professional groups. (Nancarrow et al., 2013)
	•	interdisciplinary teams must integrate changing organisational values with new modes of service delivery. (Nancarrow et al., 2013)
Interprofessional teamwork
	•	Further literature reviews [11] have identified the importance of two themes on interprofessional team work, team structure and team processes within which specific categories emerged: team premises, team size and composition, organizational support, team meetings, clear goals and objectives, and audit processes. (Nancarrow et al., 2013)
	•	nterprofessional teams, members will automatically come from different professions, therefore in practice “shared decision-making” is likely to conflate individual team members making decisions within their own scope of practice with the ideal of all team members sharing in all decision-making processes, or in other words, “appropriate” decision making. (Nancarrow et al., 2013)
Team effectiveness
	•	The concern of managers in organizations is that the teams must perform to their best. (Gupta, 2009)
	•	Donnellon (1996) emphasized that for teams to work effectively, it is important to recognize and address various paradoxes and contradictions that team work poses for individuals, teams, managers, and organizations. (Gupta, 2009)
	•	Guzzo and Disckson (1996) defined effectiveness in groups “as indicated by (a) group-produced outputs (quantity or quality, speed, customer satisfaction, and so on), (b) the consequences a group has for its members, or (c) the enhancement of a team’s capability to perform effectively in the future. (Gupta, 2009)
	•	Drexler, Sibbet, and Forrester (1995) developed a team performance model that had seen primary interdependent elements – (1) orientation, (2) trust building, (3) goal clarification, (4) decision making, (5) implementation, (6) high performance, and (7) renewal – each representing a set of concerns team members face as they work together. (Gupta, 2009)
	•	Huszczi (1990) identified seven key components ofr building team effectiveness – a clear sense of direction, talented members, clear and enticing responsabilities, reasonable and efficient operating procedures, constructive interpersonal relationships, active reinforcement systems, and constructive external relationships. (Gupta, 2009)
	•	McGregor listed eight unique features of an effective managerial team: (1) understanding, mutual agreement, and identification with respect to the primary task, (2) open communications, (3) mutual trust, (4) mutual support, (5) management of human differences, (6) selective use of the team, (7) appropriate member skills, and (8) leadership. (Gupta, 2009)
	•	Some of the characteristics of an effective team as listed by Hanson and Lubin(1995) were as follows: team shares a  sense of purpose or common goals;  team  is  aware of and interested in its own processes and examining norms operating within the group; team identifies its own  resources  and uses  them depending on the team's needs at  any given time; group members continually try to  listen  to  and  clarify what is  being said and show interest in what others say and feel; differences of opinionareencouragedand  freely expressed; team  is willing to surface conflict and  focus  on  it until  it either is resolved or managed in  away that  does not reduce  the  effectiveness of the individuals involved; team  exerts energy toward problem solving rather than allowing it    to   be drained by interpersonal issues or competitive struggles; roles  are balanced  and shared to facilitate both the accomplishment of tasks  and  feel ings of group cohesion and morale; to encourage risk taking and creativity, mistakes  are treated as sources of learning rather than reasons for punishment; team is responsive to  the changing needs of its members and to the external environment to which it  is related; team members are committed to periodically evaluating the team's performance; team is attractive to  its members, who identify with it and consider it  a source of both professional and personal growth; and developing a climate of trust is recognized as the crucial element for facilitating all of the above elements. (Gupta, 2009)
Team process
	•	Team processes represent system- or team-level activities in which individual members participate jointly and, usually, reciprocally. (LePine et al., 2000)
Operational team
	•	Operational teams function within a particular organisational climate which will affect their performance and assessment of this climate can also indicate where non-technical skills may require strengthening (Holtet al., 2001). (Flin et al., 2002)
Problem-resolution teams
	•	The broad objective of problem-resolution team was "to resolve problems on a non going basis", its dominant feature  was 'trust', and  its process emphasis was on 'focus on  issues'. (Gupta, 2009)
Creative  team  
	•	The broad objective of creative  team  was "to create something", its dominant feature  was 'autonomy', and its process focus was on 'exploring possibilities and alternatives'. (Gupta, 2009)
Tactical  teams  
	•	And the broad objective of tactical  teams  was  to "well-defined plan", its dominant feature was 'clarity', and its emphasis was on 'high task and role clarity'. (Gupta, 2009)
Consultative team
	•	The consultative team members did not have the authority to implement the solutions that they developed. (Gupta, 2009)
Substantive team
	•	The substantive team members had the authority to implement the solutions that they developed. (Gupta, 2009)
Technocrats
	•	The technocrats are experts. They know the area that they are set to regulate better than any other. They serve as advisers to civil servants and ministers via expert advisory councils and agencies. They are not part of the politically appointed establishment, but are rather a politically insulated bureaucracy or expert unit that is assigned to deal with risks. (Löfstedt, 2005)
Technocracy
	•	technocracy – government by facts (Stilgoe et al., 2006)
	•	aristocracy began to give way to technocracy as a strategy of rule. (Bernays and Ewen, 2011)

Technical expertise
	•	technical expertise is a crucial political resource in all policy conflicts, even those, like surrogate motherhood, involving only limited technological sophistication. For to all the protagonists in such disputes, access to knowledge and the resulting ability to question the data used to legitimize decisions are an essential basis of power and influence. (Nelkin, 1992)
Technical lock
	•	in order to learn a subject or skill, paritucarly on that is complex, we must immerse ourselves in many details, techniques, and procedures that are standard for solving problems. If we are not careful, however, we become locked into seeing every problem in the same way, using the same techniques and strategies that became so imprinted in us. It is always simpler to follow such a route. In the process we lose sigh of the bigger picture, the purpose of what we are doing, how each problem we face is different an requires a different approach. We adopt of kind of tunnel vision. (Greene, 2014)
	•	This technical lock afflicts people in all fields as they lose a sense of the overall purpose of thei work, of the larger question at hand, of what impels them to do their work in the first place. (Greene, 2014)
	•	
Technology
	•	It is easy to become enamored with the powers that technology affords us, and to see them as the end and not the means. (Greene, 2014)
	•	The technology is based on isolation, and the technical process isolates in turn. From the automobile to television, all the goods selected by the spectacular system are also its weapons for a constant reinforcement of the conditions of isolation of “lonely crowds.” (Debord, 2012)
Spectacular technology
	•	Spectacular technology has not dispelled the religious clouds where men had placed their own powers detached from themselves; it has only tied them to an earthly base. (Debord, 2012)
Technology-based criterion
	•	a technology-based criterion which essentially reflects the idea that a satisfactory level of risk prevention is attained when ‘state of the art’ control measures (technological, managerial, organisational) are employed to control risks whatever the circumstances. (Great Britain and Health and Safety Executive, 2001)
	•	technology-based criteria often ignore the balance between costs and benefits. They would, for example, require wood furniture manufacturers to adopt the state-of-the- art technology developed for keeping, clinically clean, factories, manufacturing medicines – hardly a realistic proposition. (Great Britain and Health and Safety Executive, 2001)
Technological controversies
	•	Technological controversies are often remarkable in the way they combine moral argument with extensive use of scientific expertise (Nelkin, 1992)
Television
	•	Television encourages exhibitionism. (Coker, 2009)
	•	Il est légitime d’accorder à la télévision une certaine prééminence sur les autres media car c’est elle qui a sans doute le plus fort pouvoir de persuasion. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	L’image, puissamment fascinante, exerce une attraction incomparable. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Rien ne peut, en effet, rivaliser avec les moyens de communication modernes pour ce qui regarde l’influence sur le public. (Mannoni, 1985)
Tension
	•	Under stress or any threat, the most primitive parts of the brain are aroused and engaged, overwhelming people’s reasoning powers. In fact, stress or tension can reveal flaws in people that they have carefully concealed from view. It is often wise to observe people in such moments, precisely as a way to judge their true character. (Greene, 2018)
Terre nullius
	•	territory which is not under the jurisdiction of a State and, therefore, is subject to appropriation. (Joyner, 1981)
Territory title
	•	Generally speaking, under contemporary international law, six methods of acquiring title to territory are recognized by states: occupation, accretion, prescription, voluntary cession, conquest, and treaties of peace. (Joyner, 1984)
Terror
	•	Terror is not war; it is a tactic meant to derail, or slow down, the forces of globalization. (Coker, 2009)
Terrorism
	•	Terrorism is perhaps the best example of a threat carried out by civilians of one state or community against civilians of another state or community; the threat thus bypassing the state-level. (Rasmussen, 2004)
	•	In the spatial dimension, terrorism, like climate change and transnational organized crime, affects everyone, everywhere. (Coker, 2009)
	•	Terrorism itself implies surprise. Without tactical surprises the terrorist or insurgent group would quickly fall to the stronger forces of state intelligence and security. Without strategic surprise terrorism would fail in its purpose to shock and thus disturb normality and by so doing convey a powerful communications signal. (Omand, 2014)
	•	In terrorism, the weaker side engages in an asymmetric conflict in the hope of being able to choose the time, place, method and target of attack so that the security forces will always be caught unawares. Terrorists become adept at mounting secondary attacks to catch security forces off guard, such as leaving a second explosive device to detonate as the security forces and ‘blue light’ services arrive to deal with a first attack. (Omand, 2014)
	•	they terrorize you with this insecurity. They now control your emotions. (Greene, 2018)
Terrorist
Terrorist attack
	•	The terrorist attacks showed that there is almost no network that stands alone. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
Terrorist capability
	•	Terrorist capabilities may include providing highly trained and skilled military units with shoulder-fired weapons and explosives; developing unsophisticated nuclear weapons, known as dirty bombs or other improvised explosive devices; and funding operations and furnishing fake identification, including passports and driver’s licenses. Terrorists may also be trained in sabotage, hostage taking, and homicides. (Vellani, 2007)
Terrorist risk
	•	the risk of terrorism might be measured by the expected absolute number of deaths, in relation to the whole population. (Frühling, 2014)
	•	The overall risks from terror- ist attack would worsen greatly if terrorists or other non-state criminal groups were to obtain a new safe haven, or succeed in acquiring sig- nificant means of mass disruption, as they might if international action is not mobilized to stop further proliferation. (Omand, 2014)
Terrorist attack prevention
	•	“Using intelligence to prevent terrorist attacks is very difficult. There are no troop mobilizations to watch for, no ships, no aircraft to track”. (Dahl, 2013)
Terrorism threat analysis
	•	terrorism threat analysis is normally qualitative. (Vellani, 2007)
Testing
	•	Scientists make a big deal out of "testing." It is through testing— evaluating ideas about how the world works in the light of evidence— that scientists claim superiority for their ways of knowing. It is testing, ultimately, that allows us to decide whether some idea or theory is right or wrong. And testing is really based on experience that is interpreted with the appropriate conceptual apparatus. (Clarke, 1999)
Theatre
	•	If the theater and actors were traditionally represented by the image of masks, writers such as Shakespeare are implying that all of us are constantly wearing masks. (Greene, 2018)
Theory
	•	theory determines what kind of predictive variables are examined, how they are measured, and how they are combined to generate an overall risk rating. (Sottilotta, 2016) 
	•	A theory is frequently conceived of as a set of connected statemtns used in the process of explanation (R. J. Johnston et al. 1994). The nature of status of theories can be seen to differ among the various philosophies of social science (Davies et al., 2002)
	•	In the field of security/strategic studies, theories exist for specific problems: deterrence, alliances, not of (regional) security as such. (Buzan and Wæver, 2003)
	•	Many Europeans use the term theory for anything that organises a field systematically, structures questions, and establishes a coherent and rigorous set of interrelated concepts and categories. Americans, however, often demand that a theory strictly explains and that it contains – or is able to generate – testable hypotheses of a causal nature. (Buzan and Wæver, 2003)
	•	A theory makes a satisfactory explanation when it is not circular, not ad hoc, and it is testable independently of the facts it is intended to explain (Jarvie 1968:199). (Boholm, 1996)
	•	Theories are necessary for judging the meaning of data, but they are also the source of mistaken judgments of evidence. (Betts, 2007)
	•	A less obvious source is that theories that are ideal for some analytical functions turn out to be dangerous for others. (Betts, 2007)
	•	Consumers, nevertheless, are every bit as theoretical as anyone else even if they don’t realize it, since they make assumptions all the time about how patterns of experience demonstrate general propositions about the way the world works. (Betts, 2007)
	•	Theory is an academic term not much in vogue in the Intelligence Community, but it is unavoidable in any discussion of analytical judgment. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	In one popular meaning of the term, “theoretical” is associated with the terms “impractical” and “unrealistic”. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	A theory is a generalization based on the study of many examples of some phenomenon. It specifies that when a given set of conditions arises, certain other conditions will follow either with certainty or with some degree of probability. (Heuer, 1999) 
	•	conclusions are judged to follow from a set of conditions and a finding that these conditions apply in the specific case being analyzed. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	What academics refer to as theory is really only a more explicit version of what intelligence analysts think of as their basic understanding of how individuals, institutions, and political systems normally behave. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Ideological ingredients of our knowl- edge and, more especially, of our observations, are discovered with the help of theories which are refuted by them. They are discovered counter-inductively. (Feyerabend, 1993)
	•	Let me repeat what has been asserted so far. Theories are tested and possibly refuted by facts. Facts contain ideological components, older views which have vanished from sight or were perhaps never formulated in an explicit manner. These components are highly suspicious, first, because of their age, because of their antediluvian origin; second, because their very nature protects them from a critical examination and always has protected them from such an examination. (Feyerabend, 1993)
	•	Theories can be interpreted in different ways. They will be commensurable in some interpretations, incom- mensurable in others. (Feyerabend, 1993)
Critical theory
	•	Critical theory must be communicated in its own language. This is the language of contradiction, which must be dialectical in its form as it is in its content. It is critique of the totality and historical critique. It is not a "zero degree of writing" but its overcoming. It is not a negation of style, but the style of negation. (Debord, 2012)
Functional theory
	•	a functional theory does not go beyond the facts it intends to explain; a certain tinge of circularity, or of adhoc-ness, is an inevitable consequence (Jarvie 1968:199). (Boholm, 1996)
Erroneous theories
	•	any erroneous theories are perpetuated because they seem plausible and because people record their experience in a way that supports rather than refutes them. (Heuer, 1999)
Theory of error
	•	theory of errors: when we make an observation, the measurement is never exact in a mathematical sense, so there is always some uncertainty as to the ‘True’ value. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
	•	Science as it should be, third-world science, agrees with the proscribed rules. Science as we actually find it in history is a com- bination of such rules and of error. It follows that the scientist who works in a particular historical situation must learn how to recognize error and how to live with it, always keeping in mind that he himself is liable to add fresh error at any stage of the investigation. He needs a theory of error in addition to the "certain and infallible" rules which define the "approach to the truth." (Feyerabend, 1993)
	•	Now error, being an expression of the idiosyncrasies of an individual thinker, observer, even of an individual measuring instrument, depends on circumstances, on the particular phenomena or theories one wants to analyze, and it develops in highly unexpected ways. Error is itself a historical phenomenon. A theory of error will therefore contain rules of thumb, useful hints, heuristic suggestions rather than general laws, and it will relate these hints and these suggestions to historical episodes so that one sees in detail how some of them have led some people to success in some situations. It will develop the imagination of the stu- dent without ever providing him with cut-and-dried prescriptions and procedures. It will be more a collection of stories than a theory in the proper sense and it will contain a sizable amount of aimless gossip from which everyone may choose what fits in with his intentions. (Feyerabend, 1993)
	•	a little brainwashing will go a long way in making the history of science more simple, more uniform, more dull, more "objective," and more accessible to treatment by "certain and infallible" rules: a theory of errors is superfluous when we are dealing with well-trained scientists who are kept in place by an internal slave mastercalled "professional conscience" and who have been convinced that it is good and rewarding to attain, and then to forever keep, one's "profes- sional integrity." (Feyerabend, 1993)
Theory of group and grid
	•	This theory was originally developed as a neutral instrument by means of which the morphology of societies could be compared irrespective of their existence in time and space.' 'Grid' and 'group' are taken to be universal gradual coordinates that measure 'possible social structures'. (Boholm, 1996)
	•	It should be noted that although grid and group are introduced as terms repre- senting gradual scales, when they are combined to form a typology, theyfunction as if they were binary pairs. Grid-group theory identifies the follow- ing set of cosmological types, all of which, in principle at least, are taken to be co-existent in every society: (i) egalitarianism: strong group/weak grid; (ii) hierarchy: strong group/strong grid; (iii) fatalism: weak group/strong grid and (iv) individualism: weak group/weak grid. Each type implies a characteristic stance towards the environment, other people and the self and, since they offer different 'solutions' to life, each making its own 'bid for space, time and resources for a particular social organization' (Douglas 1996:175),they will contest each other (1996:83-85). A fifth possibility is occasionally considered, the autonomous 'hermit' who assumes a position detached from the grid-group classification. In cultural theory, these 'cosmologies' have been appropriated and renamed 'ways oflife', and there are: 'five and only five ways of life - hierarchy, egalitarianism, fatalism, individualism and autonomy' (Thompson et al. 1990:3). (Boholm, 1996)
Thinking
	•	Systems 1 and 2 are not systems in the standard sense of entities with interacting aspects or parts  (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	You should treat “System 1” and “System 2” as nicknames, (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	We cannot divorce emotions from thinking. The two are completely intertwined. But there is inevitably a dominant factor, some people more clearly governed by emotions than others. What we are looking for is the proper ratio and balance, the one that leads to the most effective action. (Greene, 2018)
Conscious thinking
	•	The conscious thinking we depend on is quite limited. We can hold on to only so much information in short- and long-term memory. (Greene, 2018)
Fast thinking
	•	System 1 operates automatically and quickly, with little or no effort and no sense of voluntary control. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	The automatic operations of System 1 generate surprisingly complex patterns of ideas (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	The automatic operations of System 1 generate surprisingly complex patterns of ideas (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	examples of the automatic activities that are attributed to System 1: Detect that one object is more distant than another. Orient to the source of a sudden sound. Complete the phrase “bread and...”Make a “disgust face” when shown a horrible picture. Detect hostility in a voice. Answer to 2+2=? Read words on large billboards. Drive a car on an empty road. Find a strong move in chess (if you are a chess master).Understand simple sentences. Recognize that a “meek and tidy soul with a passion for detail” resembles an occupational stereotype. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	The capabilities of System 1 include innate skills that we share with other animals (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	Other mental activities become fast and automatic through prolonged practice. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	System 1 has learned associations between ideas (the capital of France?); it has also learned skills such as reading and understanding nuances of social situations. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	The knowledge is stored in memory and accessed without intention and without effort. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	System 1 runs automatically (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	System 1 continuously generates suggestions for System 2: impressions, intuitions, intentions, and feelings. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	System 1 runs into difficulty, it calls on System 2 to support more detailed and specific processing that may solve the problem of the moment. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	System 1 is generally very good at what it does: its models of familiar situations are accurate, its short-term predictions are usually accurate as well, and its initial reactions to challenges are swift and generally appropriate. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	System 1 has biases, however, systematic errors that it is prone to make in specified circumstances. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	System 1 is that it cannot be turned off. If you are shown a word on the screen in a language you know, you will read it—unless your attention is totally focused elsewhere. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	Because System 1 operates automatically and cannot be turned off at will, errors of intuitive thought are often difficult to prevent. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	System 1—appears to have a special aptitude for the construction and interpretation of stories about active agents, who have personalities, habits, and abilities. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	System 1 detects simple relations (“they are all alike,” “the son is much taller than the father”) and excels at integrating information about one thing, but it does not deal with multiple distinct topics at once, nor is it adept at using purely statistical information (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	System 1 has more influence on behavior when System 2 is busy, and it has a sweet tooth (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	System 1 is impulsive and intuitive; (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	System 1 treated the mere conjunction of two words as representations of reality. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	System 1 provides the impressions that often turn into your beliefs, and is the source of the impulses that often become your choices and your actions. It offers a tacit interpretation of what happens to you and around you, linking the present  with the recent past and with expectations about the near future. It contains the model of the world that instantly evaluates events as normal or surprising. It is the source of your rapid and often precise intuitive judgments. And it does most of this without your conscious awareness of its activities. System 1 is also, as we will see in the following chapters, the origin of many of the systematic errors in your intuitions. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	System 1 can respond to impressions of events of which System 2 is unaware (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	In the absence of an explicit context, System 1 generated a likely context on its own. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	When uncertain, System 1 bets on an answer, and the bets are guided by experience (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	System 1 is gullible and biased to believe (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	System 1 excels at constructing the best possible story that incorporates ideas currently activated, but it does not (cannot) allow for information it does not have. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	System 1 operates as a machine for jumping to conclusions. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	System 1 is expected to influence even the more careful decisions. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	Jumping to conclusions on the basis of limited evidence is so important to an understanding of intuitive thinking, (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	It continuously monitors what is going on outside and inside the mind, and continuously generates assessments of various aspects of the situation without specific intention and with little or no effort. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	System 1 also support the substitution of one judgment for another. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	System 1 has been shaped by evolution to provide a continuous assessment of the main problems that an organism must solve to survive: How are things going? Is there a threat or a major opportunity? Is everything normal? Should I approach or avoid? (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	System 1 understands language, of course, and understanding depends on the basic assessments that are routinely carried out as part of the perception of events and the comprehension of messages. These assessments include computations of similarity and representativeness, attributions of causality, and evaluations of the availability of associations and exemplars. They are performed even in the absence of a specific task set, although the results are used to meet task demands as they arise. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	System 1 carries out many computations at any one time. Some of these are routine assessments that go on continuously. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	An active, coherence-seeking System 1 suggests solutions to an undemanding System 2. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	Characteristics of System 1: generates impressions, feelings, and inclinations; when endorsed by System 2 these become beliefs, attitudes, and intentions; operates automatically and quickly, with little or no effort, and no sense of voluntary control; can be programmed by System 2 to mobilize attention when a particular pattern is detected (search); executes skilled responses and generates skilled intuitions, after adequate training; creates a coherent pattern of activated ideas in associative memory; links a sense of cognitive ease to illusions of truth, pleasant feelings, and reduced vigilance; distinguishes the surprising from the normal; infers and invents causes and intentions; neglects ambiguity and suppresses doubts biased to believe and confirm exaggerates emotional consistency (halo effect)focuses on existing evidence and ignores absent evidence(WYSIATI); generates a limited set of basic assessments; represents sets by norms and prototypes, does not integrate; matches intensities across scales (e.g., size to loudness); computes more than intended (mental shotgun); sometimes substitutes an easier question for a difficult one (heuristics); is more sensitive to changes than to states (prospect theory); overweight’s low probabilities shows diminishing sensitivity to quantity (psychophysics); responds more strongly to losses than to gains (loss aversion) frames decision problems narrowly, in isolation from one (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	System 1 is highly adept in one form of thinking—it automatically and effortlessly identifies causal connections between events, sometimes even when the connection is spurious. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	System 1 is inept when faced with “merely statistical” facts, which change the probability of outcomes but do not cause them to happen. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	System 1 is not prone to doubt. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	System 1 understands sentences by trying to make them true, and the selective activation of compatible thoughts produces a family of systematic errors that make us gullible and prone to believe too strongly whatever we believe. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	System 1 tries its best to construct a world in which the anchor is the true number. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	people who let themselves be guided by System 1 are more strongly susceptible to availability biases than others who are in a state of higher vigilance. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	System 1 is often able to produce quick answers to difficult questions by substitution, creating coherence where there is none. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	System 1 is indeed the origin of much that we do wrong, but it is also the origin of most of what we do right—which is most of what we do. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	System 1 registers the cognitive ease with which it processes information, but it does not generate a warning signal when it becomes unreliable. Intuitive answers come to mind quickly and confidently, whether they originate from skills or from heuristics. (Kahneman, 2012)
Slow thinking
	•	slow thinking as you proceeded through a sequence of steps. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	The process was mental work: deliberate, effortful, and orderly—a prototype of slow thinking. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	System 2 allocates attention to the effortful mental activities that demand it, including complex computations. The operations of System 2 are often associated with the subjective experience of agency, choice, and concentration. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	When we think of ourselves, we identify with System 2, the conscious, reasoning self that has beliefs, makes choices, and decides what to think about and what to do. (Kahneman, 2012) 
	•	The highly diverse operations of System 2 have one feature in common: they require attention and are disrupted when attention is drawn away. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	Here are some examples: Brace for the starter gun in a race. Focus attention on the clowns in the circus. Focus on the voice of a particular person in a crowded and noisy room. Look for a woman with white hair. Search memory to identify a surprising sound. Maintain a faster walking speed than is natural for you. Monitor the appropriateness of your behavior in a social situation. Count the occurrences of the letter a in a page of text. Tell someone your phone number. Park in a narrow space (for most people except garage attendants). Compare two washing machines for overall value. Fill out a tax form. Check the validity of a complex logical argument. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	System 2 has some ability to change the way System 1 works, by programming the normally automatic functions of attention and memory (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	Everyone has some awareness of the limited capacity of attention, and our social behavior makes allowances for these limitations. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	Intense focusing on a task can make people effectively blind, even to stimuli that normally attract attention. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	System 2 is normally in a comfortable low-effort mode, in which only a fraction of its capacity is engaged. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	System 2, impressions and intuitions turn into beliefs, and impulses turn into voluntary actions. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	System 2 adopts the suggestions of System 1 with little or no modification. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	System 2 is mobilized when a question arises for which System 1 does not offer an answer, (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	System 2 is activeted when an event is detected that violates the model of the world that System 1 maintains. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	System 2 is also credited with the continuous monitoring of your own behavior—the control that keeps you polite when you are angry, and alert when you are driving at night. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	System 2 is mobilized to increased effort when it detects an error about to be made (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	System 2 takes over when things get difficult, and it normally has the last word. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	One of the tasks of System 2 is to overcome the impulses of System 1. In other words, System 2 is in charge of self-control. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	Biases cannot always be avoided, because System 2 may have no clue to the error. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	System 2 is much too slow and inefficient to serve as a substitute for System 1 in making routine decisions (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	My answer is that the brief active sentence that attributes calculation to System 2 is intended as a description, not an explanation. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	“System 2” is a better subject for a sentence than “mental arithmetic.” (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	System 2, in this story, is that its operations are effortful, and one of its main characteristics is laziness, a reluctance to invest more effort than is strictly necessary. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	there are vital tasks that only System 2 can perform because they require effort and acts of self-control in which the intuitions and impulses of System 1 are overcome. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	A crucial capability of System 2 is the adoption of “task sets”: it can program memory to obey an instruction that overrides habitual responses. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	Psychologists speak of “executive control” to describe the adoption and termination of task sets (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	System 2 also has a natural speed. You expend some mental energy in random thoughts and in monitoring what goes on around you even when your mind does nothing in particular, but there is little strain. Unless you are in a situation that makes you unusually wary or self-conscious, monitoring what happens in the environment or inside your head demands little effort. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	Another way of saying this is that controlling thoughts and behaviors is one of the tasks that System 2 performs. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	activities that impose high demands on System 2 require self-control, and the exertion of self-control is depleting and unpleasant. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	System 2 is capable of reasoning, and it is cautious, but at least for some people it is also lazy. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	System 2 is lazy and that mental effort is aversive  (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	The spreading of activation in the associative machine is automatic, but we (System 2) have some ability to control the search of memory, and also to program it so that the detection of an event in the environment can attract attention  (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	The disruption of System 2 had a selective effect: it made it difficult for people to “unbelieve” false sentences.  (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	when System 2 is otherwise engaged, we will believe almost anything. 
	•	System 2 is in charge of doubting and unbelieving, but System 2 is sometimes busy, and often lazy.  (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	System 2 receives questions or generates them: in either case it directs attention and searches memory to find the answers. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	An intention of System 2 to answer a specific question or evaluate a particular attribute of the situation automatically triggers other computations, including basic assessments. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	I have also presented System 2 as active in deliberate memory search, complex computations, comparisons, planning, and choice. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	it appeared that System 2 is ultimately in charge, with the ability to resist the suggestions of System 1, slow things down, and impose logical analysis. Self-criticism is one of the functions of System 2. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	In the context of attitudes, however, System 2 is more of an apologist for the emotions of System 1 than a critic of those emotions—an endorser rather than an enforcer. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	System 2 is capable of doubt, because it can maintain incompatible possibilities at the same time. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	The attentive System 2 is who we think we are. System 2 articulates judgments and makes choices, but it often endorses or rationalizes ideas and feelings that were generated by System 1. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	System 2 is not a paragon of rationality. Its abilities are limited and so is the knowledge to which it has access. We do not always think straight when we reason, and the errors are not always due to intrusive and incorrect intuitions. Often we make mistakes because we (our System 2) do not know any better. (Kahneman, 2012)
Exceptional thinking
	•	Exceptional thinking will include whatever ideas make the case for acting on the basis of improbable contingencies. (Betts, 2007)
	•	A process that injects some form of exceptional thinking—for example, applying contrary hypotheses and reasoning backward from the improbable outcome to make the case for how it could happen—might mitigate the risks in relying on probabilities based on long experience. (Betts, 2007)
Human thinking
	•	but our thinking is more like a daydream, a wish, than deep analysis. (Greene, 2018)
Primitive pattern of thinking
	•	when people operate in groups, they do not engage in nuanced thinking and deep analysis. Only individuals with a degree of calmness and detachment can do so. People in groups feel emotional and excited. Their primary desire is to fit in to the group spirit. Their thinking tends to be simplistic—good versus evil, with us or against us. They naturally look for some type of authority to simplify matters for them. Deliberatelycreating chaos, as Mao did, only makes the group more certain to fall into these primitive patterns of thinking, since it is too frightening for humans to live with too much confusion and uncertainty. (Greene, 2018)
Thinking backward
	•	One technique for exploring new ground is thinking backwards. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	As an intellectual exercise, start with an assumption that some event you did not expect has actually occurred. Then, put yourself into the future, looking back to explain how this could have happened. Think what must have happened six months or a year earlier to set the stage for that outcome, what must have happened six months or a year before that to prepare the way, and so on back to the present. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Thinking backwards changes the focus from whether something might happen to how it might happen. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Putting yourself into the future creates a different perspective that keeps you from getting anchored in the present. Analysts will often find, to their surprise, that they can construct a quite plausible scenario for an event they had previously thought unlikely. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Thinking backwards is particularly helpful for events that have a low probability but very serious consequences should they occur, such as a collapse or overthrow of the Saudi monarchy. (Heuer, 1999)
Role playing
	•	Role playing is commonly used to overcome constraints and inhibitions that limit the range of one’s thinking. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Playing a role changes “where you sit.” (Heuer, 1999)
	•	It also gives one license to think and act differently. Simply trying to imagine how another leader or country will think and react, which analysts do frequently, is not role playing. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	Gaming gives no “right” answer, but it usually causes the players to see some things in a new light. Players become very conscious that “where you stand depends on where you sit.” (Heuer, 1999)
	•	By changing roles, the participants see the problem in a different context. (Heuer, 1999)
Shorterm thinking
	•	Although this stands as an ideal, we must admit that such a perspective is rare among us humans. It seems to require an effort that is almost beyond us. The reason for this is simple: short-term thinking is hardwired into our system; we are built to respond to what is immediate and to seek out instant gratification. For our early human ancestors, it paid to notice what was potentially dangerous in the environment or what offered an opportunity for food. The human brain as it evolved was designed not to examine the full picture and context of an event but to home in on the most dramatic features. This worked well in a relatively simple environment and amid the simple social organization of the tribe. But it is not suited to the complex world we now live in. It makes us take notice mostly of what stimulates our senses and emotions, and miss much of the larger picture. (Greene, 2018)
Visual form
	•	People with a high visual sense are often labelled as dyslexic, for example. (Greene, 2014)
Thought
	•	The mind and the body are one, and your thoughts affect your physical responses. People can recover much more quickly from illness through sheer desire and willpower.  (Greene, 2018)
Mode of thought
Contemplative
	•	Ideas most often “pop out” of what cognitive psychologist Guy Claxton has described as the “contemplative” mode of thought, which is slow moving and largely unconscious, rather from the “deliberative” mode, which is fast moving and conscious. (Fishbein and Treverton, 2004)
Threat
	•	Hazards and threats are the sources of negative risks. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	The threat is the source in a harmful state (such as a flood that reaches you). (Newsome, 2013)
	•	The hazard and threats are sources of the risk in the sense that they are the actual actors or agents with the potential to harm, while the risk is the potential harm. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Hazard and threat are different states of the same thing: The hazard is in a harmless state, the threat in a harmful state. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	The hazard would do no harm unless it were to change into a threat. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	A threat is an actor or agent in a harmful state. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	A threat is any actor or agent whose capacity to harm you is not currently avoided, contained, inactive, or deactivated. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	The hazard is a harmless state with potential to change into threat; the threat is the same source, except in a harmful state. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	A threat could be changed into a hazard if it could be manipulated into a harmless state. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Hazard and threat are different states of the same thing. Concepts that explain a hazard’s transition to threat include activation, coincidence, enablement ,and release from containment, as described in the subsections below. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	[…] in theory, hazards and threats are on a continuous scale. Anything could be considered hazardous or threatening to some degree. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	The intent to harm is fundamental to a deliberate threat. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	A threat becomes more threatening as it becomes more intent on harming us. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Intent to harm is necessary but not sufficient for a threat: The threat must have the capability to harm us. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	The threat is the subject whose actions cause harm to the object. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	a threat is anything that can exploit a vulnerability, intentionally or accidentally, and obtain, damage, or destroy an asset. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	Threats are classified as either human or natural. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	Threat can also be defined as an adversary’s intent, motivation, and capability to attack assets. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	threats are acts or conditions that can harm organizational assets. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	Threats can be classified as either human or natural. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	Threats may also change depending on the adversary’s access to tools and weapons. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	Threats are an act or condition that seeks to obtain, damage, or destroy an asset. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	Threats change over time. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	A threat is an event with an undesired impact. (Landoll, 2011)
	•	Treats and threat agents are inextricably linked, in that it is the threat agent that causes a threat to happen. (Landoll, 2011)
	•	A threat is an undesired event that may result in the loss, disclosure, or damage to an organizational asset. (Landoll, 2011)
	•	If there is no threat, then there can be no risk no matter how many vulnerabilities you have. Having zero threats may seem like a theoretical state; after all, experience tells you that every weakness is found and exploited eventually. (Wheeler, 2011)
	•	A threat is a specific danger which can be precisely identified and measured on the basis of the capabilities an enemy has to realise a hostile intent. (Rasmussen, 2006)
	•	Different states and nations have different thresholds for defining a threat. (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	What constitutes the threat for one is not necessarily the referent object for the other. (Buzan et al., 1997)
	•	Threats that are only imagined and anticipated in the abstract tend not to play well to taxpayers today. (Gray, 2014)
	•	The English term ‘threat’, or ‘menace’ (Latin: ‘tru- dere’ or to push, thrust; French: ‘menace’; Italian: ‘minaccia’; Spanish: ‘amenaza’ or: ‘conminación’; Portuguese: ‘ameaça’; German: ‘Drohung’ or ‘Bedrohung’) refers to “a communication of a disagreeable alternative to an individual or group by one in authority or who pretends to be” (Koschnik 1992: 210). (Brauch, 2011)
	•	According to Webster’s Dictionary a ‘threat’ is “1. a statement or expression of intention to hurt, destroy, punish, etc. in retaliation or intimidation”, and 2. “an indication of imminent danger, harm, evil etc.; as, the threat of war” (McKechnie 1979: 1901). (Brauch, 2011)
	•	Langenscheidt-Longman (1995) defines ‘threat’ as: “1. a statement that you will cause someone pain, unhappiness, or trouble...; 2. the possibility that something very bad will happen (famine, attack etc.)...; 3. someone or something that is regarded as a possible danger”. (Brauch, 2011)
	•	 For the Compact Oxford English Dictionary threat means: “1. a stated intention to inflict injury, damage, or other hostile action on someone; 2. a person or thing likely to cause damage or danger; 3. the possibility of trouble or danger” (Soanes 2000: 1199). (Brauch, 2011)
	•	For the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary threat refers to “1. A throng or crowd of people; a troop, a band. ... 2. Oppression, compulsion; torment; distress, misery; danger. ... 3. A declaration of an intention to make some hostile ac- tion, esp. a declaration of an intention to inflict pain, injury, damage, or other punishment in retribution for something done or not done. ... An indication of the approach of something unwelcome or undesirable; a person or thing regarded as a likely cause of harm etc.” (Oxford 52002: 3251). (Brauch, 2011)
	•	Thus, in the common use of the term in contemporary British and American English the word ‘threat’ has multiple meanings. (Brauch, 2011)
	•	In security policy and studies ‘threat’ is used as a ‘political term’ and as a ‘scientific concept’ that remains undefined in many social science dictionaries. (Brauch, 2011)
	•	Robertson (1987: 304 – 305) used the concept ‘threat assessment’ as an analysis of “the reasons behind an opponent’s armament programmes” that was often made during the Cold War “on a worst case basis”, where “besides personnel and hardware totals” the opponent’s strategic doctrine had also to be taken into account. (Brauch, 2011)
	•	These threats, Buzan (1983: 88) argued, “define [the state’s] insecurity, and set the agenda for national security as a security problem”. (Brauch, 2011)
	•	Dealing with specific threats, an international security strategy focuses on “the sources and causes of threats, the purpose being not to block or offset the threats, but to reduce or eliminate them by political action” (Buzan 1983: 218).. (Brauch, 2011)
	•	A threat is a person’s resolve to inflict harm on another. Threats can be made against most entities – people, organizations, nations (i.e., by threat agent). (Prunckun, 2015)
	•	Threats are context dependent, and what forms a threat in a business setting does not necessarily form a threat in a military setting or national security setting (though the opposite may be true). (Prunckun, 2015)
	•	Under stress or any threat, the most primitive parts of the brain are aroused and engaged, overwhelming people’s reasoning powers. In fact, stress or tension can reveal flaws in people that they have carefully concealed from view. It is often wise to observe people in such moments, precisely as a way to judge their true character. (Greene, 2018)
Threat analysis
	•	Threat analysis acknowledges two key factors – that there needs to be a threat agent (which could be anything from a physical substance to a person or a body corporate/organisation) and an object of th threat (i.e., the target – which does not have to be a material target such as a shopping mall or an individual – can be intangible such as the threat to national security or the security of a particular venue or event). (Prunckun, 2015)
Threat agent
	•	A threat agent is the entity that may cause a threat to happen. (Landoll, 2011)
	•	Threats and threat agents are inextricably linked, in that it is the threat agent that causes a threat to happen. (Landoll, 2011)
	•	Threat agents include Mother Nature and mankind. (Landoll, 2011)
	•	Threat agents are the catalyst of the threat. (Landoll, 2011)
	•	A threat agent is the entity that causes a threat to happen. (Landoll, 2011)
	•	Threat agents do not have to penly declare their resolve to cause harm in order to constitute a threat, though explicit words or actions make it easier for field operatives to identify the threat agents and for analyst to assess the threat. (Prunckun, 2015)
	•	When analyst assess a threat agent, they are gauging wheter the agent has intent and capability to produce harm to a target. (Prunckun, 2015)
	•	To weigh whther the agent has intent and capability, analysts need to establish two elements for each of these factors: desire and expectation (or ability) for intent, and knowledge and resources for capability. (Prunckun, 2015)
	•	Desire can be described as the threat agent’s enthusiasm to cause harm in pursuit of their goal. Expectation is the confidence the threat agents have in that they will achieve their goal if their plan is carried out. Knowledge is having information that will allow the threat agents to use of construct devices or carry out processes that are necessary for achieving their goal. Resources include skills (or experience) and materials needed to act on their plan. (Prunckun, 2015)
Threat’s cause
	•	The source of the threat is whatever activated the hazard into the threat. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	The cause of the threat include the activation of the hazard into a threat.  (Newsome, 2013)
Threat prevention
	•	Prevention of the causes would be prevent the threat from arising from the hazard. (Newsome, 2013)
Threat perception
	•	In most cases, the fact that the other is a strategic actorwith several choices is an amplifying factor in any threat perception andtherefore assists in pushing an issue across the security threshold. (Buzan et al., 1997)
External threat
	•	External threats include accidental impact damage by missiles and vehicles, act of God and natural causes, abnormal environmental extremes, external interference by a variety of cause including action by humans and chemicals, instability of structures or foundations, force majeure and external releases of energy or toxins (Wells, 1996)
Threat to identity
	•	A threat to identity occurs when these motives cannot be satisfied. If they find that esteem, continuity, distinctiveness or efficacy is threatened, individuals will use a variety of strategies to protect or regain them. IPT has now generated an extensive series of studies which illustrate that individuals in the same social category will accept and use (i.e. reproduce or act in accordance with) a particular social representation to differing degrees depending upon its potential impact upon their identity esteem, continuity, distinctiveness and efficacy. (Breakwell, 2014)
Emerging threat
	•	[…] the Canadian government admits an emerging threat – “a credible hazard that has recently been identified as posing an imminent threat to the safety and security of community or region” (Public Safety Canada, 2012, p. 35). (Newsome, 2013)

Specific threat
	•	[…] U.S. DOD (2012a, p. 47) refers to a specific threat as a “known or postulated aggressor activity focused on targeting a particular asset.”. (Newsome, 2013)
Threat activation
	•	Activation strictly means that some activity has changed the hazard into a threat. One useful analytical step is to list operational activities and to consider whether they could activate any of the available hazards (the resulting threats are best categorized as activity related. (Newsome, 2013)

Threat assessment
	•	Hazard and threat assessments are widely required, but widely dissastisfying. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Often a hazard or threat is assessed by its associated risk, which would be a conflation of concepts. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Hazard and threat assessment are typically dissatisfying also because they usually focus on either threat or hazard and neglect the other. Hazards rarely are assessed discreetly. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Threat assessments and risks assessment are more common but often lack realism without assessments of the hazards and of how easily the hazards could be activated as threats. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Threat assessments can be quantitative or qualitative. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	Threat assessments are used to evaluate the likelihood of adverse events, such as terrorism and crime, against a given asset as well as other hazards such as natural disasters that may affect business operations. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	Threat assessments also ask who the bad guys are by evaluating each threat on the basis of capability, intent, and impact of an attack. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	General threat assessments estimate the likelihood of adversarial attacks, including the type of adversary, their tactics, and their capabilities. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	The process of threat assessment includes: Threat identification—identify potential adversaries and their characteristics; Asset classification—identify targets and determine their criticality; Consequence/Criticality analysis—assess the effect of an assets compromise. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	threat assessments should be conducted as often as necessary to meet the needs of the organization. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	Threat assessments evaluate the full spectrum of threats that can impact assets, including natural disasters, criminal activity, terrorism, safety-related accidents, and common security breaches such as unauthorized access. Each potential threat must be analyzed using all available information to establish the likelihood of occurrence. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	Threat assessments should consider the possibility of all three types of human threats and should be based on reasonable intelligence available from multiple sources, including internal information, law enforcement data, red teams, specialists, media reports, and federal and private intelligence sources. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	After collecting, reviewing, and summarizing threat information from all available resources, security decision makers must apply the threat to specific assets. Although critical assets are the primary concern during the assessment, other assets may also be considered during the assessment phase. The goal of the assessment then is to estimate, quantitatively or qualitatively, the likelihood of occurrence that a threat will attack an asset. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	The better the understanding of the intent, motivation, and capability of an adversary, the better the assessment. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	Accurate threat assessments are critical for security decision makers; however, not even the best threat assessment can anticipate every possible scenario which may emerge. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	The mitigation of emerging threats requires the ability to think and act like the adversary. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	Maintaining a current profile of adversaries is important for the threat assessment. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	The threat assessment, for example, which is normally conducted prior to the vulnerability assessment, may have identified and prioritized threats, and these high-ranking threats serve as the scope of the vulnerability assessment. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	The most common form of threat assessment is crime analysis. Adversaries can include insiders, outsiders, or a combination of insiders and outsiders. Adversarial capability and motivation should be assessed based on the adversaries’ ability to steal, damage or destroy critical assets. The adversaries’ past methods, equipment, skills, and training should be clearly articulated in the assessment report. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	Target attractiveness is a key component of the threat assessment. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	Threat assessment poses two tasks: collecting facts and interpreting their implications. (Betts, 2007)
	•	leaders do miscalculate or misunderstand their opponents. (Omand, 2014)
	•	threat assessment seeks to determine the levels of intent and capability residing in those who may seek to cause harm (Prunckun, 2015, p. 284–285) and to report that through reference to a series of pre-defined level statements. Detected threats fall into one of two categories: general threats or specific threats. (Shortt, 2015)
	•	In essence, threat assessment is, arguably, a combination of art and science. The art is the skill required of the threat assessors to process a wide variety of information from various sources (sometimes referred to as intelligence) and to make analytical determinations about what it all means. While the science aspect is the threat formula used (Intent + Capability = Threat) combined with the assessment techniques and methods employed by the assessors to provide rigour to the process (Prunckun, 2015, pp. 283–302). (Shortt, 2015)
	•	threat assessment documents often contain classified information (from domestic, and possibly foreign, intelligence and security agencies), and/or material that identified individuals or groups and thereby may breach their privacy, or which would provide a tactical advantage to those giving rise to the threat. (Shortt, 2015)
General threat
	•	General threat assessments estimate the likelihood of adversarial attacks, including the type of adversary, their tactics, and their capabilities. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	A general threat arises from events occurring in the wider environment—such as the rise of the Islamic State (IS— also referred to by various commentators in this paper as ISIL and ISIS) and its call to jihad—which have or are likely to have an impact on the environment being assessed (i.e. New Zealand’s domestic security environment). (Shortt, 2015)
	•	It could be argued that general threats are, by their nature, more commonly encountered than specific threats. General threats, therefore, give rise to a range of prevention focused security activities (such as access controls to symbolic buildings and pre-boarding airport security screening procedures). (Shortt, 2015)

Specific threat
	•	a specific threat is where information is available identifying a particular person (or group) as having both the intent and capability to carry out an attack on a particular target (or targets), or where a particular event or person has been mentioned directly by someone seeking to cause them harm. (Shortt, 2015)
	•	specific threats give rise to more focused actions, which can include visible acts by security and law enforcement agencies such as the execution of search warrants, the arrest of suspects or the provision (or increase) of personal protection measures that include deployment of protection officers and alternative travel security (e.g. motorcades). (Shortt, 2015)
Threat assessment process
	•	The threat assessment process is designed to be devoid of political input in order to allow an unbiased and well-analysed product to emerge that can be factored into risk assessment processes by decision-makers—both bureaucratic and political (Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, 2014, p.12; Prunckun, 2015, p. 300–301). (Shortt, 2015)

Material threat
	•	Inanimate material threats are easier than human or organized threats to measure objectively, in part because material threats do not have any conscious intent. For instance, biological and chemical threats (an hazards) are assessed often by their “toxicity” and measured by some quantity, perhaps as a concentration or rate in relation to some medium (such as millilitres of hazard per liter of water) or to the human body (such as grams of hazard per pound of body weight). (Newsome, 2013)
	•	The activation of a threat from a hazardous material is usually human-caused (for instance, humans drill for oil and sometimes spill oil), so we should be careful to distinguish the human-caused threat (such as an oil spill) from the material hazard (the oil). (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Natural and inanimate threats are best understood as having accidental or mechanistic intent, rather than deliberate intent. (Newsome, 2013)
Natural threat
	•	Natural and inanimate threats are best understood as having accidental or mechanistic intent, rather than deliberate intent. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Natural threats are often cyclical or seasonal and predicatble in duration, allowing us to calculate the proportion of time when we would be exposed if we were to reside in the area where a natural hazard occurred, such as a hurricane zone that experiences a hurricane season. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Natural threats are those events that are not man-made such as tornados, hurricanes, floods, fires, and other environmental events. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	Nature—Anynumberofnaturaldisasterscoulda ectthesupportsystemsrelied upon by your organization’s information system. If the threat is a natural threat, such as storms or oods, then “nature” can be considered the threat agent. (Landoll, 2011)
Human threat
	•	events that are not man-made such as tornados, hurricanesHuman threats are those involving people working on the inside of the organization such as employers and contractors (insiders), people who attack from outside of the organization (outsiders), or a combination of the two., floods, fires, and other environmental events. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	Human threats can be further categorized as insiders, outsiders, and insid- ers working with outsiders. (Vellani, 2007)
Insider threat
	•	Insiders may be subclassified as criminal employees, dissatisfied employees, criminal contractors, and disgruntled contractors. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	Threats from insiders are considerable given their security program awareness, opportunity, and unfettered access to the facility. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	Insider threats may be active and violent or stealthy, perpetrated by silent participants with outsiders. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	Since the insider threat is typically the result of poli- cies and procedures, security decision makers cannot rely on traditional security measures such as alarms, cameras, and lighting to thwart this kind of threat. Good mitigation strategies may be put in place to protect against the insider threat, though strong policies and procedures are among the most reasonable and effective. Policies should include personnel reliability programs, recurring background checks, and limitations on access to sensitive areas of the facility. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	Insiders colluding with outsiders pose the greatest threat of all and may be classified as coerced or willing participants. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	Personal crimes are sometimes difficult to prevent because they can be committed as a spontaneousMotivations for the insider threats are often personal and driven by poor workplace management, real or perceived, resulting in an unhappy worker who bears a grudge usually against management act of rage or because of a mental disor- der. (Vellani, 2007)
Coerced insider
	•	Coerced insiders are unwilling participants in the attack who are forced by threat of harm to themselves or family or who are blackmailed. (Vellani, 2007)
Willing insider
	•	Willing insiders may have a financial interest (bribes) or may be ideologically sympathetic to the outsiders’ cause. (Vellani, 2007)
Outsider threat
	•	Outsiders may be subclassified as foreign governments and militaries, gangs, criminals, extremists, and terrorists. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	Outsiders may be motivated by ideological goals, economic gain, or personal reasons. (Vellani, 2007)
Human-activated threat
	•	A human-activated threat has changed state from hazard to threat because of some human activity-note that this outcome could have been unintended (accidental). (Newsome, 2013)
Mlitary threats 
	•	seizure of territory, invasion, occupation, change of government, manipulation of policy. (Brauch, 2011)
	•	the nature of the enemy involved is quite different: In the case of Pearl Harbor it was a state-based, conventional military threat, while the problem of terrorism today is primarily one of nonstate actors. (Dahl, 2013)
Conventional threat
	•	Mike McConnell noted that with conventional threats the enemy’s capability is fairly well understood, while its intent is the question. (Dahl, 2013)
	•	During the Cold War the enemy’s forces, such as armies and ballistic missile silos, were relatively easy to find but hard to kill. (Dahl, 2013)
	•	In the Cold War, intelligence targets were easy to find but hard to kill (Soviet military forces). (Betts, 2007)
Terrorist threat
	•	But with terrorism, ‘‘it’s just the opposite’’: The intent to commit harm is clear, and the challenge for intelligence is to learn the enemy’s capability to do so. (Dahl, 2013)
	•	Today, conversely, ‘‘the situation is reversed. We are now in an age in which our primary adversary is easy to kill but hard to find.’’ (Dahl, 2013)
	•	The good news is that adversaries today are not as capable as those the United States faced in the Cold War; the bad news is that their intentions are more absolutely hostile and that neither their capabilities nor their intentions are well detected. (Betts, 2007)
	•	today they are easy to kill but hard to find (terrorists). (Betts, 2007)
Economic threats 
	•	ex-port practices, import restrictions, price manipulations, default on debt, currency controls etc., and those to domestic stability. (Brauch, 2011)
Ecological threats 
	•	damaging the physical base of the state. (Brauch, 2011)
Threat level
	•	The Homeland Security Advisory System or homeland threat level was first released by the newly established U.S. Office of Homeland Security in late 2002. This scale included the levels severe, high, elevated, guarded, and low, which were colored red, orange,yellow, blue, and green, respectively. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Opportunities can impact the threat level more than any other factor. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	Threat levels by themselves are blunt instruments, irrespective of how well nuanced they are or should be, and only ever provide one piece of a multi-piece “jigsaw.” The jigsaw, or to use its technical name “risk analysis” (Prunckun, 2015, p. 283), is a more complex process and requires additional inputs before it can advise on what protective security actions need to be taken in response to a change in threat perception (Prunckun, 2015, p. 300–301). (Shortt, 2015)
	•	heightened public interest (and associated accountability) can be expected when a decision is taken to change a threat level to a higher setting. (Shortt, 2015)
Design basic threat
	•	Each threat should be specifically described in sufficient terms and relative to its ability to attack particular assets. This description is known as the design basis threat (DBT) because it forms the basis for the design of security pro- grams. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	The DBT includes statements of intent, motivation, and capabilities of each threat. The description also includes the known tactics and methods, weapons and equipment, and other details of past attacks by the adversary. (Vellani, 2007)
Threat information
	•	Threat information should come from multiple and redundant sources. Depending on the nature of the assets in need of protection, the sources of threat information may include internal information, security breach investigative reports, law enforcement data, red team penetration analysis reports, security consultants, media news reports, and both federal and private intelligence sources. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	For security consultants and other security decision makers who are not intimately familiar with the facility they are assessing, the best starting point in gathering threat assessment data is through interviews and surveys of people who are more familiar with the site. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	An often overlooked source of threat information is prior threat assessments. Many organizations conduct risk assessments on a continual basis and have the associated reports filed away. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	External threat information, including crime data from the local law enforcement where the facility is located, should also be reviewed. (Vellani, 2007)
Qualitative threat assessment
	•	A qualitative threat assessment is defined as a type of assessment that is driven primarily by the characteristics of the threat and is highly dependent on the skills of the assessment team. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	The threat assessment team or individual, using a qualitative approach, considers each asset in light of the given threat information for that asset, and develops scenarios that adversaries may use to estimate the likelihood of attack. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	Using a qualitative rating system, the threat assessment team assigns a linguistic value to each scenario. (Vellani, 2007)
Quantitative threat assessment
	•	Where a fair amount of threat data is available, a quantitative threat assessment is possible. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	A quantitative threat assessment is a type of assessment in which metrics are used to assign numeric values to the threat level. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	With vast amounts of prior incident data, a quantitative assessment can include mathematical projections to forecast future incidents. Using mathematical projections, quantitative threat assessments can achieve high levels of confidence, but the forecast range widens. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	A quantitative threat assessment uses a numeric threat rating scale, normally employing probability ratings. (Vellani, 2007)
Three P’s strategy
	•	The United States’ homeland security strategy may be characterized as the three P’s: Prevent, Protect, and Prepare. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	For the security decision maker, specific countermeasures are available for each P. 
Prevention measures
	•	Prevention measures can include psychological measures designed to deter criminals from perpetrating their acts on a given property by increasing the risk of detection and capture. (Vellani, 2007)
Protection measures
	•	Protection measures include security personnel and vaults. (Vellani, 2007)
Preparation measures
	•	Preparation measures include alarm system monitoring services that respond to alarms. (Vellani, 2007)
Unconventional threat
	•	Key sources of unconventional threat include terrorism, insurgency, and civil violence; higher-tech “global guerrilla” warfare; proxy “irregular” war and sophisticated “hybrid” war; the democratization of nuclear capabilities; and niche exploitation of the global commons by competitors—particularly space and cyber-space. (Freier, 2009)
	•	Unconventional threats and challenges are at the center of a contemporary risk management strategy. Unconventional challenges are both the most urgent current as well as the likeliest future threats. (Freier, 2009)
	•	The certainty of a dangerous unconventional defense future is consistent with the broad views of the new national security team. (Freier, 2009)
Threat narrative
	•	A threat narrative is the externalized behavioral storyline in which knowledge and subjective reality regarding threat is expressed (Moon 2009). It includes the answer to questions as perceived by the object of study: Is there a threat? What is motivating the threat? What is the intent? What are the capabilities of the threat? How can the threat be deterred or defended? Where did the threat come from? Why does it exist? What are the right actions regarding the threat? What are the preferred future outcomes? (Fenstermacher and Kuznar, 2016)
	•	A threat narrative is the externalized behavioral storyline in which knowledge and subjective reality regarding threat is expressed. It is not simply a threatening utter- ance (or set of utterances). (Fenstermacher and Kuznar, 2016)
	•	A threat narrative is a construct, a framework that enables meaning-making about a threat and forecasting of events. (Fenstermacher and Kuznar, 2016)
	•	Through an understanding of the threat narrative, one can begin to make inferences about the motivation(s) and the intent as well as the potential COAs in order to in uence or shape behaviors. (Fenstermacher and Kuznar, 2016)
Threat matrix
	•	After 9/11 the CIA used a ‘threat matrix’ to flag up new threats that could (and sometimes did) cause problems on both sides of the Atlantic: ‘We recognized that the matrix was a blunt instrument. You could drive yourself crazy believing all or even half of what was in it.’ (Omand, 2014)
Time
	•	Time is a major and rarely acknowledged influence in the nature and quality of environmental risk assessment in EPA. (National Research Council (U.S.) et al., 2009)
	•	The theory of strategy insists that time is the least forgiving of its subject’s dimensions.1 Time lost cannot be recovered, while time to be, which is to say the future, advances eternally beyond our grasp of detailed comprehension. (Gray, 2014)
	•	time is an important factor in the uncertainty about strategic risks. (Frühling, 2014)
	•	Time passing inevitably reduces the range of previously identified possibilities, as events do not happen, and at the same time opens up new possibilities that become credible through the turns of history. (Frühling, 2014)
	•	Time passing reveals new information that allows to more precisely characterize strategic risks, or will shake confidence in earlier assessments. (Frühling, 2014)
	•	Looking back on our life, we see that we have a tendency to be impatient and to overreact; we notice patterns of behavior over long periods of time that elude us in the moment but become clearer to us later on. What this means is that in the present moment we lack perspective. With the passage of time, we gain more information and see more of the truth; what was invisible to us in the present now becomes visible in retrospect. Time is the greatest teacher of them all, the revealer of reality. (Greene, 2018)
	•	The passage of time is like a slow ascent up the mountain. The emotions we felt in the present are no longer so strong; we can detach ourselves and see things more clearly. The further we ascend with the passage of time, the more information we add to the picture. What we saw three months after the fact is not quite as accurate as what we come to know a year later. (Greene, 2018)
	•	It would seem, then, that wisdom tends to come to us when it is too late, mostly in hindsight. But there is in fact a way for us humans to manufacture the effect of time, to give ourselves an expanded view in the present moment. We can call this the farsighted perspective, and it requires the following process. (Greene, 2018)
	•	In many ways we are defined by our relationship to time. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Your task as a student of human nature, and someone aspiring to reach the greater potential of the human animal, is to widen your relationship to time as much as possible, and slow it down. This means you do not see the passage of time as an enemy but rather as a great ally. Each stage in life has its advantages—those of youth are most obvious, but with age comes greater perspective. Aging does not frighten you. Death is equally your friend (see chapter 18). It motivates you to make the most of each moment; it gives you a sense of urgency. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Time is your great teacher and master. This affects you deeply in the present. Awareness that a year from now this current problem you are experiencing will hardly seem so important will help you lower your anxiety and adjust your priorities. Knowing that time will reveal the weaknesses of your plans, you become more careful and deliberative with them. (Greene, 2018)
	•	one area seems to defy our transformational powers—time itself. We are born and enter the stream of life, and each day it carries us closer to death. Time is linear, always advancing, and there is nothing we can do to stop its course. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Dans les problèmes sociaux, comme dans les problèmes biologiques, un des plus énergiques facteurs est le temps. Il est le seul vrai créateur et le seul grand destructeur. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Le temps est donc notre véritable maître, et il suffit de le laisser agir pourvoir toutes choses se transformer. (Lebon, 1895)
Cyclical time
	•	Time remains immobile, like a closed space. When a more complex society becomes conscious of time, its task is rather to negate it because it does not see in time that wh ich happens, but that which is repeated. A static society organ izes time in terms ofits immediate experience of nature, on the model of cyclical time. (Debord, 2012)
	•	Cyclical time already dominates the experience of nomadic populations because the same conditions repeat themselves before the nomads at every moment of their journey: Hegel notes that lithe wandering of"nomads is only formal because it is limited to uniform spaces. (Debord, 2012)
	•	Cyclical time in itself is time without conflict. (Debord, 2012)
	•	While cyclical time was the time of immobile illusion, really lived, spectacular time is the time of changing reality, lived in illusion. (Debord, 2012)
Pseudo-cyclical time
	•	Pseudo-cyclical time is in fact no more than the consumable disguise of the commodity-time of production. (Debord, 2012)
	•	The pseudo-cyclical time of modern economic survival is the time of consumption, of augmented survival, where what is lived daily is de­ prived of decision and is subject, no longer to the natural order, but to the pseudo-nature developed in alienated labor; and thus this time naturally rediscovers the ancient cyclical rhythm which regulated the survival of pre-industrial societies. (Debord, 2012)
	•	Pseudo-cyclical time leans on the natural remains of cyclical time and at the same time composes new homologous combinations: day and night, work and weekly rest, the recurrence of vacations. (Debord, 2012)
	•	Pseudo-cyclical time is a time transformed by industry. The time which has its basis in the production of commodities is itself a con­ sumable commodity which includes everything previously (during the phase of dissolution of the old unitary society) distinguished into pri­ vate life, economic life, political life. (Debord, 2012)
	•	Consumable pseudo-cyclical time is spectacular time, at once as the time for the consumption of images in the limited sense, and as the image of the consumption of time in the broad sense. (Debord, 2012)
Historical time
	•	Historical movement as such, though still hidden, begins in the slow and intangible formation of the "real nature of man," this "nature born within human history-within the generating action of human society-", yet the society, which has developed a technology and a language, is conscious only of a perpetual present, though it is itself already the pro­ duct of its own history. All knowledge limited to the memory of the oldest is always carried by the living. Neither death nor procreation aregrasped as a law of time. Time remains immobile, like a closed space. When a more complex society becomes conscious of time, its task is rather to negate it because it does not see in time that wh ich happens, but that which is repeated. A static society organ izes time in terms ofits immediate experience of nature, on the model of cyclical time. (Debord, 2012)
	•	The social appropriation of time, the production of man by human labor, develop within a society divided into classes. (Debord, 2012)
Production time
	•	The irreversible time of production is first of all the measure of com· modities. Therefore the time officially affirmed over the entire expanse of the globe as the general time of society, signifying only the specialized interests which constitute it, is only a particular time. (Debord, 2012)
	•	The time of production, commodity-time, is an infinite accumula­ tion of equivalent intervals. It is the abstraction of irreversible time where all the segments of the chronometer must only prove their quan­ titative equality. This time is in reality exactly what it is in its ex­ changeable character. It is in this social domination by commodity-time that "time is everything, man is nothing; he is at most the carcass of time." (Poverty of Philosophy). It is devalued time, the complete in­ version of time as "the field of human development." (Debord, 2012)

Time passage
	•	Most of us live within a relatively narrow time frame. We generally associate the passage of time with something negative—aging and moving closer to death. Instinctively we recoil from thinking too deeply about the future and the past, for this reminds us of the passage of time. In relation to the future we may try to think about our plans a year or two from now, but our thinking is more like a daydream, a wish, than deep analysis. In relation to the past we may have a few fond or painful memories from childhood and later years, but in general the past baffles us. We change so much with each passing year that who we were five, ten, twenty years ago might seem like a stranger to us. We don’t really have a cohesive sense of who we are, a feeling of connection between the five-year-old and thirty-five-year-old versions of ourselves. (Greene, 2018)
	•	If we look more closely, however, at our personal experience of time, we can notice something peculiar—the passage of the hours or days can alter depending on our mood and circumstances. (Greene, 2018)
	•	What this means in general is that time is a human creation, a way for us to measure its passage for our own purposes, and our experience of this artificial creation is quite subjective and changeable. We have the power to consciously slow it down or speed it up. Our relationship to time is more malleable than we think. Although we cannot stop the aging process or defy the ultimate reality of death, we can alter the experience of them, transforming what is painful and depressing into something much different. We can make time feel more cyclical than linear; we can even step outside the stream and experience forms oftimelessness. We do not have to remain locked in the hold of our generation and its perspective. (Greene, 2018)
Time to response models
	•	the form of the likelihood depends on the amount of information available on tumor onset times, on whether or not the tumor is rapidly lethal, and on the relationship between tumor mortality and causes of death (Krewski et al., 1983: Moolgavkar etal., 1999a). (Moolgavkar and Leubeck, 2002)
Timidity
	•	Timidity is a quality we generally acquire. It is a function of our mounting fears as we get older and a loss of confidence in our powers to get what we want. We become overly concerned with how people perceive us and worry what they will think if we stand up for ourselves. We internalize their doubts. We become afraid of any kind of conflict or confrontation, which will churn up emotions and lead to consequences we cannot predict or control. We develop the habit of backing down. We don’t say what we feel even when it would be appropriate, and we fail to set boundaries to people’s harmful behavior. We find it hard to ask for a raise or a promotion or the respect due to us. Losing our bold spirit, a positive form of aggression, is losing a deep part of our self, and it is inevitably painful. (Greene, 2018)
Tolerability
	•	'Tolerability' does not mean 'acceptability'. It refers to a willingness to live with a risk so as to secure certain benefits and in the confidence that it is being properly controlled. (Great Britain and Health and Safety Executive, 1992)
	•	The term ‘tolerable’ refers to an activity that is seen as worth pursuing (for the benefit it carries) yet requires additional efforts for risk reduction within reasonable limits. (Renn, 2007b)
Tolerance
	•	From this more neutral stance, you can then try to understand the people you deal with on a deeper level, as Chekhov did with his father. The more you do this, the more tolerant you will tend to become toward people and toward human nature in general. Your open, generous spirit will make your social interactions much smoother, and people will be drawn to you. (Greene, 2018)
	•	If you can learn to detect the signs of it in yourself (see the following sections for help on this), you can channel this darker energy into productive activity. You can turn your neediness and vulnerability into empathy. You can channel your aggressive impulses into worthwhile causes and into your work. You can admit your ambitions, your desires for power, and not act so guiltily and stealthily. You can monitor your suspicious tendencies and the projection of your own negative emotions onto others. You can see that selfish and harmful impulses dwell within you as well, that you are not as angelic or strong as you imagine. With this awareness will come balance and greater tolerance for others. (Greene, 2018)
Tolerate a risk
	•	To tolerate a risk means that we do not regard it as negligible or something we might ignore, but rather as something we need to keep under review and reduce still further if and as we can. (Great Britain and Health and Safety Executive, 1992)
	•	To designate a risk as ‘tolerable’ means that it is not to be regarded as negligible or something that might be ignored but, rather, as something to be kept under review and possibly reduced still further, depending on circumstances. There is also the clear implication that there are some risks that just cannot be tolerated. (Bandle, 2007)
	•	A risk deemed ‘tolerable’ links undertaking an activity which is considered worth- while for the value-added or benefit it provides with specific measures to diminish and limit the likely adverse consequences. This judgement is informed by two distinct but closely related efforts to gather and compile the necessary knowledge which, in the case of tolerability, must additionally support an initial understanding of required risk reduction and mitigation measures. (Renn, 2007a)

Tolerability of risk
	•	[…] the Tolerability of Risk (TOR),2 for reaching decisions on whether risks from an activity or process are unacceptable, tolerable or broadly acceptable and its application in practice. In this context, ‘tolerable’ does not mean ‘acceptable’. It refers instead to a willingness by society as a whole to live with a risk so as to secure certain benefits in the confidence that the risk is one that is worth taking and that it is being properly controlled. However, it does not imply that the risk will be acceptable to everyone, ie that everyone would agree without reservation to take the risk or have it imposed on them. (Great Britain and Health and Safety Executive, 2001)
	•	both the level of individual risks and the societal concerns engendered by the activity or process must be taken into account when deciding whether a risk is unacceptable, tolerable or broadly acceptable; (Great Britain and Health and Safety Executive, 2001)
	•	the decision-making process and criteria adopted are such that action taken is inherently precautionary; (Great Britain and Health and Safety Executive, 2001)
	•	The triangle represents increasing level of ‘risk’ for a particular hazardous activity (measured by the individual risk and societal concerns it engenders) as we move from the bottom of the triangle towards the top. The dark zone at the top represents an unacceptable region. For practical purposes, a particular risk falling into that region is regarded as unacceptable whatever the level of benefits associated with the activity. Any activity or practice giving rise to risks falling in that region would, as a matter of principle, be ruled out unless the activity or practice can be modified to reduce the degree of risk so that it falls in one of the regions below, or there are exceptional reasons for the activity or practice to be retained. (Great Britain and Health and Safety Executive, 2001)
	•	The light zone at the bottom, on the other hand, represents a broadly acceptable region. Risks falling into this region are generally regarded as insignificant and adequately controlled. We, as regulators, would not usually require further action to reduce risks unless reasonably practicable measures are available. The levels of risk characterising this region are comparable to those that people regard as insignificant or trivial in their daily lives. They are typical of the risk from activities that are inherently not very hazardous or from hazardous activities that can be, and are, readily controlled to produce very low risks. Nonetheless, we would take into account that duty holders must reduce risks wherever it is reasonably practicable to do so or where the law so requires it. (Great Britain and Health and Safety Executive, 2001)
	•	The zone between the unacceptable and broadly acceptable regions is the tolerable region. Risks in that region are typical of the risks from activities that people are prepared to tolerate in order to secure benefits, in the expectation that: the nature and level of the risks are properly assessed and the results used properly to determine control measures. The assessment of the risks needs to be based on the best available scientific evidence and, where evidence is lacking, on the best available scientific advice; the residual risks are not unduly high and kept as low as reasonably practicable (the ALARP principle – see Appendix 3); and the risks are periodically reviewed to ensure that they still meet the ALARP criteria, for example, by ascertaining whether further or new control measures need to be introduced to take into account changes over time, such as new knowledge about the risk or the availability of new techniques for reducing or eliminating risks. (Great Britain and Health and Safety Executive, 2001)
	•	Benefits for which people generally tolerate risks typically include employment, lower cost of production, personal convenience or the maintenance of general social infrastructure such as the production of electricity or the maintenance of food or water supplies. (Great Britain and Health and Safety Executive, 2001)
	•	As such the framework can be seen as essentially applying an equity-based criterion for risks falling in the upper region, while a utility-based criterion predominates for risks falling in the middle and lower regions and technology-based criteria complement the other criteria in all three regions. (Great Britain and Health and Safety Executive, 2001)
	•	the factors and processes that ultimately decide whether a risk is unacceptable, tolerable or broadly acceptable are dynamic in nature and are sometimes governed by the particular circumstances, time and environment in which the activity giving rise to the risk takes place. (Great Britain and Health and Safety Executive, 2001)
	•	the protocols, procedures and criteria described in this document should ensure that in practice, risks are controlled to such a degree that the residual risk is driven down the tolerable range so that it falls either in the broadly acceptable region or is near the bottom of the tolerable region, in keeping with the duty to ensure health, safety and welfare so far as is reasonable practicable. (Great Britain and Health and Safety Executive, 2001)
	•	The TOR framework just described can in principle be applied to all hazards. When determining reasonably practicable measures for any particular hazard, whether theoption we have chosen to control the risk is good enough or not depends in part on where the boundaries are set between the unacceptable, tolerable or broadly acceptable regions. (Great Britain and Health and Safety Executive, 2001)
	•	the choice will be the outcome of much deliberation and negotiation in the course of policy development, reflecting the value preferences of stakeholders and the practicability of possible solutions. (Great Britain and Health and Safety Executive, 2001)
	•	Individuals tolerate different levels of risk, depending on the benefits they think they will gain from taking them. Equally, society’s tolerance of different risks varies for a whole variety of reasons, some relatively straightforward and amenable to scientific evaluation and others complex expressions of deep- seated, psychological attitudes. (Bandle, 2007)
	•	The ToR framework (Figure 5.1) is constructed to reflect how people in general approach risk, in other words that some risks are so high that they would, ordinarily, be viewed as intolerable whatever the benefits that might be gained by taking them. (Bandle, 2007)
	•	the HSE has not formulated an algorithm to calculate the maximum degree of disproportion that it would expect duty-holders to tolerate in any particular circumstances; rather the HSE determines how hard it pushes duty- holders to do more to control a particular risk by – given the status quo – where that risk falls in the ToR framework. For example:• if the risk falls into the ‘unacceptable’ region, the HSE will be extremely reluctant to accept any arguments from duty-holders for not ‘doing more’;• for risks in the ‘broadly acceptable’ region, the HSE will advise duty-hold- ers to turn their attention to other risks (whilst making sure they maintainthe controls which achieved that level of risk in the first place); and• as regards risks in the ‘tolerable’ region, how hard the HSE pushes depends on where the risk lies in relation to the other two regions, taking an increas- ingly hard line as the ‘unacceptable’ region is approached – in other words the higher the risk, the greater can be the disproportionality between costand benefit without the HSE conceding it to be ‘grossly disproportionate’. (Bandle, 2007)
	•	To make the ToR framework into a practical decision-making tool in which particular risks can be located, the regions need to be delineated by tolerability criteria. (Bandle, 2007)
	•	It must be emphasized that the ToR framework has no formal, legal status – there is no mention of it in the Health and Safety at Work Act or its regulations – and the individual risk and societal risk criteria are in no respect compliance limits. (Bandle, 2007)
	•	the ToR framework and the tolerability criteria provide the HSE and its stakeholders with an effective framework for decision-making which enables the dialogue, discussion and negotiation on the control strategies and standards of protection to be applied and enforcement action to be taken. (Bandle, 2007)
	•	Use of the ToR framework in practice has shown it to be particularly successful in assisting decision-making in relation to acute risks. (Bandle, 2007)
	•	Cimtires are also important factors in how different risks are tolerated or rejected. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Awareness of risk tolerance is useful strategically because the strategist normally would seek to control intolerable risks but not control tolerable risks. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Risk tolerance implies that we are prepared to live with th risk without further action. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	[…] risk tolerance implies passive acceptance. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	The IRGC (2008, pp. 6, 20) noted that organizations must recognize the surrounding “political cultures” and “risk culture, which impacts on the level for risk tolerance (or risk aversion), and the degree of trust in the institutions responsible for risk governance.”. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Perversely, people tend to tolerate frequent negative events, like road traffic events, even though they would not accept similar losses of life concentrated in shorter periods of time. Some risk are tolerated because they are familiar, routine, and distributed regularly over time. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Ideally, we would seek to control intolerable risks until the residual risk is tolerable. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Sometimes the controls would be impractical or unjustifiably burdensome, in which case risk mangers might accept a residual risk level that is higher than the tolerability level. (Newsome, 2013)

Tolerable risk
	•	If risks are classified as tolerable, or if there is dispute as to whether they are tolerable or acceptable, risk management needs to design and implement actions that make these risks acceptable over time. (Renn, 2007b)
Tone
	•	Pay deep attention to the moods of people, as indicated by their body language and tone of voice. When they talk, they have a feeling tone that is either in sync or not in sync with what they are saying. This tone can be one of confidence, insecurity, defensiveness, arrogance, frustration, elation. This tone manifests itself physically in their voice, their gestures, and their posture. (Greene, 2018)
Topology
	•	Topology is a kind of geometry.  (Stewart, 2013)
	•	One of the founding papers in topology is ‘Analysis situs’, published in 1895 by Poincaré. It introduced a structure known as the fundamental group, associated with any topological space. Two spaces that are continuously deformable into each other have isomorphic fundamental groups; that is, the fundamental group is a topological invariant. (Stewart, 2013)
	•	To represent the topology accurately, some words must be considered to be equivalent. The symbols are required to satisfy particular algebraic relations that encode the topology of the knot complement. (Stewart, 2013)
	•	The focus on topology is one of its biggest strengths of the network approach, useful whenever topology is more relevant than metrics. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
	•	In social networks, the relevance of topology means that social structure matters. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
Tort system
	•	The tort system is the legal system that allows parties to bring claims of wrongdoing, harm, or injustice against another party. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	The tort system is an uncertain instrument and a negative risk given that a court could disagree with the claimant’s case against a liable party, leaving the claimant with legal costs or an order to pay the other party’s legal costs. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	The tort system is useless to us if the court is biased against us, the liable party has insufficient reserves or assets to cover our losses, or the liable party is able to evade a court’s judgment. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	The effectiveness of the tort system varies by time and space. (Newsome, 2013)
Totalitarian state
	•	Totalitarian states were especially disgusted at human fallibility. (Coker, 2009)
Totalitarism
Totalitarian movement
	•	Totalitarian movements are possible wherever there are masses who for one reason or another have acquired the appetite for political organization. (Arendt, 2009)
	•	The success of totalitarian movements among the masses meant the end of two illusions of democratically ruled countries in general and of European nation-states and their party system in particular. The first was that the people in its majority had taken an active part in government and that each individual was in sympathy with one's own or somebody else's party. On the contrary, the movements showed that the politically neutral and indifferent masses could easily be the majority in a democratically ruled country, that therefore a democracy could function according to rules which are actively recognized by only a minority. The second democratic illusion exploded by the totalitarian movements was that these politically indifferent masses did not matter, that they were truly neutral and constituted no more than the inarticulate backward setting for the political life of the nation. Now they made apparent what no other organ of public opinion had ever been able to show, namely, that democratic government had rested as much on the silent approbation and tolerance of the indifferent and inarticulate sections of the people as on the articulate and visible institutions and organizations of the country. Thus when the totalitarian movements invaded Parliament with their contempt for parliamentary government, they merely appeared inconsistent: actually, they succeeded in convincing the people at large that parliamentary majorities were spurious and did not necessarily correspond to the realities of the country, thereby undermining the self-respect and the confidence of governments which also believed in majority rule rather than in their constitutions. (Arendt, 2009)
	•	It has fequently been pointed out that totalitarian movements use and abuse democratic freedoms in order to abolish them. This is not just devilish cleverness on the part of the leaders or childish stupidity on the part of the masses. (Arendt, 2009)
Tough guy
	•	e projects a rough masculinity that is intended to intimidate. He has a swagger and an air that signals he is not to be messed with. He tends to boast about past exploits—the women he has conquered, the brawls, the times he’s outnegotiated opponents. Although he seems extremely convincing in telling such stories, they feel exaggerated, almost hard to believe. Do not be fooled by appearances. Such men have learned to conceal an underlying softness, an emotional vulnerability from deep within that terrifies them. On occasion you will see this sensitive side—they may cry, or have a tantrum, or suddenly show compassion. Embarrassed by this, they will quickly cover it up with a tough or even cruel act or comment. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Such men will often make terrible decisions under the impact of the emotions that they have tried to conceal and repress but that inevitably surface. Although they like to dominate women, they will often end up with a wife who clearly dominates them, a secret wish of theirs. (Greene, 2018)
	•	You must not let yourself be intimidated by the front, but also be careful to not stir up their deep insecurities by seeming to doubt their tall tales or masculine nature. They are notoriously touchy and thin- skinned, and you might detect a micropout on their face if you trigger their insecurities, before they cover it up with a fierce scowl. If they happen to be a rival, they are easy to bait into an overreaction that reveals something less than tough. (Greene, 2018)
Tourism
	•	This society which eliminates geographical distance reproduces distance internally as spectacular seperation. (Debord, 2012)
	•	A by-product of the circulation of commodities, tourism, human cir­ culation considered as consumption, is basically reduced to the leisure of going to see what has become banal. The economic organization of the frequentation of different places is already in itself the guarantee of their equivalence. The same modernization which has removed time from travel has also removed from it the reality of space. (Debord, 2012)
Tradition
	•	C’est alors qu’intervient le processus de l’institutionnalisation dont un des buts primordiaux est de fixer la forme de la « communion » par un ensemble de rites. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	le rite est « un acte qui peut être individuel ou collectif mais qui, toujours, lors même qu’il est assez souple pour comporter une marge d’improvisation, reste fidèle à certaines règles qui, précisément, constituent ce qu’il y a en lui de rituel », et, ajoute notre auteur, « la répétition est donnée dans l’essence même du rite ». (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	itératif et réglé ne peut s’expliquer par le hasard et remplit une fonction importante. Celle-ci semble devoir être recherchée du côté de la tendance à l’uniformité, à l’ordre et à la cohésion. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Point de vue qui appelle à un élargissement de notre perspective et à une assimilation des fêtes, célébrations et commémorations aux rites, l’ensemble constituant les traditions. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Les traditions représentent les idées, les besoins, les sentiments du passé. Elles sont la synthèse de la race et pèsent de tout leur poids sur nous. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Ce qui conduit les hommes, surtout lorsqu'ils sont en foule, ce sont les traditions;
	•	Sans traditions, il n'y a ni âme nationale, ni civilisation possibles. Aussi les deux grandes occupations de l'homme depuis qu'il existe ont-elles été de se créer un réseau de traditions, puis de tâcher de les détruire lorsque leurs effets bienfaisants se sont usés. Sans les traditions, pas de civilisation; sans la destruction de ces traditions, pas de progrès. La difficulté est de trouver un juste équilibre entre la stabilité et la variabilité; et cette difficulté est immense. Quand un peuple a laissé des coutumes se fixer trop solidement chez lui pendant beaucoup de générations, il ne peut plus changer et devient, comme la Chine, incapable de perfectionnement. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	l'idéal pour un peuple est-il de garder les institutions du passé, en ne les transformant qu'insensiblement et peu à peu. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Les conservateurs les plus tenaces des idées traditionnelles, et qui s'opposent le plus obstinément à leur changement, sont précisément les foules, et notamment les catégories de foules qui constituent les castes. (Lebon, 1895)
Traffic data
	•	In the wake of the terrorist attacks in New York in 2001, in Madrid in 2004, and in London in 2005, several governments have proposed, as an anti-terrorist measure, the storage of electronic traffic data. In this proposal, years of phone calls and emails between citizens would be recorded for safety purposes. The content of the messages would not be stored: it would be enough to record only senders and recipients (and sometimes time and place of communication). As police forces know, even this simple map of who is connected with whom is a powerful instrument in tracking people’s activity. Indeed from a sketch of phone calls, we can deduce habits, circles of friends, and various other data about a person.  (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
Tragedy
	•	A great power which fails to engage in a rational pursuit of hegemony will ultimately put its very survival at risk (Gowan, 2002)
	•	[…] the defeat of a great power typically means the destruction of its territorial integrity and redistribution of its land (Gowan, 2002)
Training
	•	Constant training and practice will not address accident scenarios that are unanticipated, excessively dangerous, or politically unpalatable. (Sagan, 1995)
Trance
	•	N’importe qui n’entre pas en trances, n’importe quand, n’importe comment. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Effectivement, loin d’être un expression sauvage, la transe relève d’un mysticism rigoureusement determine et réglé. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Ils sont des temps forts rythmant la vie sociale qui ne saurait s’en passer. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	La transe vraie serait donc, pour le groupe, un manière socialement bien définie, et acceptée de maîtriser ses fantasmes ou, du moins de leur donner une expression qui évacue périodiquement leur surplus énergétique. (Mannoni, 1985)
Transformation
	•	The transformations are permutations of the roots, but we now think of permutations as functions, not as arrangements.  (Stewart, 2013)
Transcendental illusion
	•	transcendental illusion, characterizes rationalist philosophies which regard the idea of a teleology or purpose in nature as furnishing proof of the existence of a divine being (Power, 2009)
Transcient
	•	repeated, the trajectory is evolving towards a periodic loop but has not reached it, is called a transient. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
Transnational problem
	•	Transnational problems are, thus, often not very susceptible to “analysis,’ whether of the traditional or alternative variety, because there are too many hypotheses to consider and too little solid information to support logical judgments. (Fishbein and Treverton, 2004)
	•	Understanding complex transnational issues requires an alternative analysis approach that is more an ongoing organizational process aimed at promoting continuous “mindfulness” than a set of tools that analysts are encouraged to employ when needed. (Fishbein and Treverton, 2004)
	•	transnational threats today pose even greater complexity, in that
	•	they involve multiple actors—including nonstate entities—that can adapt and transform themselves faster than those who seek to monitor and contain them. (US Government, 2009)
	•	
Transparency
	•	Bureaucrats concerned about transparency have now begun to retreat from public meetings, favouring memos and informal discussions. (Löfstedt, 2005)
	•	A transparent process, however, is not problem free. (Lofstedt, 2004)
	•	Greater transparency also leads to the development of so-called policy vacuums (Powell and Leiss 1997). (Lofstedt, 2004)
	•	Today, in a transparent environment, the conflicts and deliberations are for everyone to see, and more importantly, for everyone who wants to, to try to influence. This causes information vacuums, as those in power, the regulators, are not always quick enough to respond concretely to a regulatory uncertainty, thus leaving it vulnerable to attack by more trusted bodies. For a body to exert its influence in this new environment it needs to have three things going for it; namely, public trust, a well-toned communication machine, and speed on the ground (for a great discussion, see Leiss 2001). (Lofstedt, 2004)
	•	Increased transparency in the policymaking process also leads to the growth of scien- tific pluralism (Jasanoff 1990). (Lofstedt, 2004)
	•	Hence, Kiselycznyk and Saunders define ‘transparency’ narrowly as ‘providing information about military capabilities and policies that allows other countries to assess the compatibility of those capabilities with a country’s stated security goals’. (Frühling, 2014)
	•	Transparency, of course, is not a cure-all. (Choi, 1996)
	•	some forms of transparency may tend to create instability and feelings of vulnerability. (Choi, 1996)
	•	There are various types of transparency measures: information measures, communication measures, notification measures, and observation and verification measures. (Choi, 1996)
	•	Taking the issue of transparency’s value further, O’Neill (in Moore, 2014, pp. 131–132) is quoted as saying that “[s]ome claim that it is the ‘key to better governance’, to stemming corruption and to accountability.” (Shortt, 2015)
Public agency transparency
	•	In general terms, public agency transparency has been linked to increased trust in government, and trust in government has been linked to greater citizen satisfaction and economic prosperity (Ayres & Braithwaite 1992, Levi & Stoker 2000, Fukuyama 1995, Inglelhart 1999, and Putnam 2000, as cited in Grimmelikhuijsen, 2009, p. 174). (Shortt, 2015)
Traumatism
	•	« Si un sujet est soumis à des stress inévitables, écrit J. Corraze (op. cit., p. 79), ou s’il perd, ce qui revient au même, le contrôle des renforceurs, il finit par présenter un passivité excessive, une altération des motivations, un état que Sligman qualifie de détresse acquise. » (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	La capativité, la déportation la vie concetrationnaire déterminent, elles aussi, un effrondrement de la personnalité et des réactions dépressives. (Mannoni, 1985)
Collective traumatism
	•	Il arrive que la société tout entire, comme l’individu, fasse l’expérience d’un veritable traumatisme provoquant la désorganisation de l’activité cérébrale. C’est ainsi, par exemple, que certains facteurs du milieu, intervenant à un niveau élevé d’intensité, peuvent avoir une influence pathogène en provoquant ce que l’on peut regrouper sous la rubrique Générale des traumatismes collectifs. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	La guerre est sans doute, de tous les cas, le plus significative. Les combats, les bombardements engendrent des ébranlements émotionnels importants qui peuvent se traduire soit par la panique, la fuite éperdue, des états de sidération, des états confusionnels ou crépusculaires (ce qui realise le tableau Classique de l’accès d’angoisse suraiguë), soit par des troubles névrotiques ou psychosomatiques plus ou moins systématisés. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Cependant, quelques états aigus passent à la chronicité, le plus souvent sous forme schizophrénique ou névrotique.” (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	« Si un sujet est soumis à des stress inévitables, écrit J. Corraze (op. cit., p. 79), ou s’il perd, ce qui revient au même, le contrôle des renforceurs, il finit par présenter un passivité excessive, une altération des motivations, un état que Sligman qualifie de détresse acquise. » (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Un collectivité peut faire l’expérience d’un assiègement psychologique également pathogène. Les auteurs parlent alors de “névrose obsidionale”, à cause de la menace d’encerclement qui fait figure d’élément dominant dans ces situations. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Il est vrai sans doute que le siege commence quand on pense qu’on est assiégé. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	“L’important n’est pas la réalité de la vie, écrit R. Micchielli (1972, p.34), mais ce que les gens croient.” (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	“des troubles mentaux, au sens le plus general du terme, don’t les individus qui en sont atteints ne sont pas conscients de la nature pathologique et qui s’appliquent à un ensemble de personnes unies par les liens plus ou moins serrés de lieu, d’époque, de conditions ou d’intérêts communs ». (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Dans la plupart des cas, les idées prévalentes se développent autour d’un thème de sorcellerie ou de mysticisme, comme ans les sectes où l’on voit se regrouper autour d’un personnage délirant central, qui joue le rôle d’élément inducteur actif, des débiles, des illuminés ou des exaltés. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	C’est onc bien l’idée fausse qui, devenant prévalente, et s’imposant à la plupart des membrs du groupe, caractérise la psychose collective. (Mannoni, 1985)
Trend
	•	As individuals, we can participate in this trend simply by pursuing mastery. In our apprenticeships, we naturally begin by learning the parts and making various distinctions – the right and wrong way to proceed, the individual skills to master and their particular techniques, the various rules and conventions that govern the group. In the Creative-Active we begin to melt these distinctions as we experiment with, shape, and alter these conventions to suit out purposes. And in mastery we come full circle, returning to a sense of the whole. We intuit, and see connections, We embrace the natural complexity of life, making the brain expand to the dimensions of reality instead of shrinking it to the narrowest of specializations. This is the inevitable outcome of deep immersion in a field. We can define intelligence as moving toward thinking that is more contextual, more sensitive to the relationships between thing. (Greene, 2014)
	•	We can all recognize signs of this nervous impatience in our own lives, but what we don’t recognize is the distorting effect it has on our thinking. The trends of the moment—in business or politics—are embedded in larger trends that play out over the course of weeks and months. Such larger spans of time tend to reveal the relative weaknesses and strengths of an investment, a strategic idea, a sports team, or a political candidate, which are often the opposite of what we see in the microtrends of the moment. (Greene, 2018)
Microtrend
	•	We can all recognize signs of this nervous impatience in our own lives, but what we don’t recognize is the distorting effect it has on our thinking. The trends of the moment—in business or politics—are embedded in larger trends that play out over the course of weeks and months. Such larger spans of time tend to reveal the relative weaknesses and strengths of an investment, a strategic idea, a sports team, or a political candidate, which are often the opposite of what we see in the microtrends of the moment. (Greene, 2018)
	•	In isolation, a poll or stock price do not tell us much about these strengths and weaknesses. They give us the deceptive impression that what is revealed in the present will only become more pronounced with time. It is normal to want to keep up with the latest news, but to base any kind of decision on these snapshots of the moment is to run the risk of misreading the larger picture. (Greene, 2018)
Triangle
	•	What he needed was to define a triangle as an ordered triple of line segments. (Stewart, 2013)
Isocel
	•	the isosceles triangle has mirror symmetry. (Stewart, 2013)
Triangle congruence
	•	Equality for triangles is what we now call ‘congruent’—Stewart, Ian. Symmetry: A Very Short Introduction (Very Short Introductions) (p. 15). OUP Oxford. Kindle Edition. (Stewart, 2013)
Triangulation
	•	Triangulation involves employing complementary methods or data sources to circumvent the potential inadequacies of single data sources. A key issue is that, if the conclusions reached using different sources coalesce, the researcher should be able to put forward research conclusion with more confidence. (Davies et al., 2002)
	•	Triangulation – collecting information from a diverse range of individuals and settings, using a variety of methods (Maxwell, 2013)
	•	“Theory triangulation” means “approaching data with multiple perspectives and hypotheses in mind (..). Various theoretical points of view could be placed side by side to assess their utility and power” (1978, p. 297) (Flick, 1992)
	•	advocates of triangulation emphasize the necessity of using mixed methods to understand the social world from theoretically driven bases. Rather than focusing on the ontological complexity of social phenomena, these authors suggest that social phenomena operate on different levels – specifically, those of structure and agent (Boaler, 1997; Hartnoll, 1991; Kelle, 2001; Nash, 2002). In this respect, the use of multiple methods to generate appropriate types of data is held to be essential to the development of robust sociological explanations of the social world (Moran-Ellis, 2006)
	•	The lexical definition of triangulation is that it is a process of using trigonometry in determining an unknown point or location by using the position of two fixed points a known distance apart (Webster’s New Collegiate Dictionary, 1980). (Thurmond, 2001)
	•	Triangulation is the combination of two or more data sources, investigators, methodologic approaches, theoretical perspectives (Denzin, 1970; Kimchi, Polivka, & Stevenson, 1991), or analytical methods (Kimchi et al., 1991) within the same study. These combinations result in data triangulation, investigator triangulation, methodological triangulation, theoretical triangulation, (Denzin, 1970; Patton, 1990), or analytical triangulation (Kimchi et al., 1991) (Thurmond, 2001)
Time triangulation
	•	Time triangulation indicates collection of data at different times to determine if similar findings occur (Kimchi et al., 1991). Variance in events, situations, times, places, and persons add to the study because of the possibility of revealing atypical data or the potential of identifying similar patterns, thus increasing confidence in the findings (Fielding & Fielding, 1986). (Thurmond, 2001)

Investigator triangulation
	•	Investigator triangulation involves using more than one observer, interviewer, coder, or data analyst in the study. Confirmation of data among investigators, without prior discussion or collaboration with one another, lends greater credibility to the observations (Denzin, 1970). (Thurmond, 2001)

Methodologic triangulation
	•	Methodologic triangulation has also been called multimethod, mixed-method, or methods triangulation (Barbour, 1998; Greene & Caracelli, 1997; Polit & Hungler, 1995). (Thurmond, 2001)
	•	Methodologic triangulation as addressed in the literature can be somewhat confusing (Goodwin & Goodwin, 1984) because it can refer to either data collection methods or research designs (Lincoln & Guba, 1985). (Thurmond, 2001)
	•	By using multiple methods, the researcher strives to decrease the “deficiencies and biases that stem from any single method” (Mitchell, 1986, p. 19) creating “the potential for counterbalancing the flaws or the weaknesses of one method with the strengths of another” (p. 21) (Thurmond, 2001)
	•	methodological triangulation involves a complex process of playing each method off against the other so as to maximize the validity of field efforts” (1978, p. 304). (Flick, 1992)
Theoretical triangulation
	•	Theoretical triangulation is the use of multiple theories or hypotheses when examining a phenomenon (Denzin, 1970). (Thurmond, 2001)
	•	intent is to conduct the study with multiple lenses and questions in mind, to lend support to or refute findings. (Thurmond, 2001)
	•	theoretical triangulation, the perspectives or hypotheses used in the study may be related or have opposing viewpoints, depending on what the researcher hopes to accomplish (Denzin, 1970) (Thurmond, 2001)
	•	Theoretical triangulation may be used to test various theories by analyzing information from the same data set (Boyd, 2000) (Thurmond, 2001)
Data-analysis triangulation
	•	Data-analysis triangulation is the combination of two or more methods of analyzing data (Thurmond, 2001)
	•	These techniques can include different families of statistical testing or different statistical techniques to determine similarities or validate data (Kimchi et al., 1991) (Thurmond, 2001)
Tribalism
	•	Tribalism has its roots in the deepest and most primitive parts of our nature, but it is now coupled with much greater technological prowess, which makes it all the more dangerous. What allowed us thousands of years ago to bind our group tightly and survive could now easily lead to our extinction as a species. The tribe feels its very existence at stake by the presence of the enemy. There is little middle ground. Battles can be more intense and violent between tribes. Greene, 2018)
Tribal power
	•	Tribal power comes from the tribesmen themselves, and as such cannot be used against itself to maintain a structure they oppose. (Coker, 2009)
Tribe feels
	•	The tribe feels its very existence at stake by the presence of the enemy. There is little middle ground. Battles can be more intense and violent between tribes. (Greene, 2018)
Tribal tendency
	•	finally, look at our tribal tendencies and how they have now found the perfect medium to operate in—we can find a group to identify with, reinforce our tribal opinions in a virtual echo chamber, and demonize any outsiders, leading to mob intimidation. (Greene, 2018)
Tribune
	•	L'art de parler aux foules est d'ordre inférieur sans doute, mais exige des aptitudes toutes spéciales. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	L'orateur, en communication intime avec la foule, sait évoquer les images qui la séduisent. (Lebon, 1895)
Trigger point
	•	We can recognize a trigger point by the experience of emotions that are unusually primal, more uncontrollable than normal. They trigger tears, deep depression, or excessive hope. People under the spell of these emotions will often have a very different tone of voice and body language, as if they were physically reliving a moment from early life. (Greene, 2018)
Trust
	•	trust is important for all forms of human social interaction. (Slovic, 1993)
	•	numerous recent studies clearly point to lack of trust as a critical factor underlying the divisive contro- versies that surround the management of technological hazard. (Slovic, 1993)
	•	To appreciate the importance of trust, it is instructive to compare those risks that we fear and avoid withthose we casually accept. (Slovic, 1993)
	•	Trust is fragile. It is typically created rather slowly, but it can be destroyed in an in- stant-by a single mishap or mistake. (Slovic, 1993)
	•	Thus, once trustis lost, it may take a long time to rebuild it to its former state. In some instances, lost trust may never be regained. (Slovic, 1993)
	•	The asymmetry between the difficulty of creating trust and the ease of destroying it has been studied by social psychologists within the domain of interpersonal perception. (Slovic, 1993)
	•	The fact that trust is easier to destroy than to create reflects certain fundamental mechanisms of human psychology that I shall call “the asymmetry principle.” When it comes to winning trust, the playing field is not level. (Slovic, 1993)
	•	Negative (trust-destroying) events are more visible or noticeable than positive (trust-building) events. (Slovic, 1993)
	•	When events do come to our attention, negative (trust-destroying) events carry much greater weight than positive events. (Slovic, 1993)
	•	Adding fuel to the fire of asymmetry is yet an-other idiosyncracy of human psychology-sources of bad (trust-destroying)news tend to be seen as more crediblethan sources of good news. (Slovic, 1993)
	•	initial trust or distrust colors our interpretation of events, thus reinforcing our prior beliefs. (Slovic, 1993)
	•	Understandingthe root causes of social conflict and recognizing the need to create better risk-management processes are essential first steps toward improving the situation. (Slovic, 1993)
	•	Trust has become a popular research subject in the social sciences during the last two decades. (Poortinga and Pidgeon, 2003)
	•	Trust is considered to lubricate social interactions on various levels so that these function smoothly and harmo- niously (e.g., Tyler & Degoey, 1996), it is thought to reduce social uncertainty and complexity (Luhmann, 1979; Barber, 1983; Earle & Cvetkovich, 1995), and is seen to be an important element of social capital and as a prerequisite for a healthy and flexible economy and democracy (e.g., Putnam, 1993; Fukuyama, 1995; Dekker, 1999; Kasperson et al., 1999; Cook, 2000). (Poortinga and Pidgeon, 2003)
	•	trust in risk management institutions may be an important factor in perception and acceptance of risks. (Poortinga and Pidgeon, 2003)
	•	The relationship between trust and risk perception has since gained widespread attention (e.g., Renn & Levine, 1991; Pidgeon et al., 1992; Slovic, 1993). Fur- thermore, trust is seen as one prerequisite for effec- tive risk communication (e.g., Kasperson et al., 1992), while distrust may be associated with stigmatization of technologies, such as nuclear power (Flynn et al., 2001) as well as social amplification effects following major failures of risk regulation (see Freudenburg, 2003; Kasperson et al., 2003). (Poortinga and Pidgeon, 2003)
	•	In very general terms, Rousseau et al. (1998) argue that trust, as conceptualized across a number of disciplines, can be defined as: “a psychological state comprising the intention to accept vulnerability based upon the behavior of positive expectations of the intentions of or behavior of another” (p. 395). (Poortinga and Pidgeon, 2003)
	•	In a series of experiments, in which they varied specific characteristic of the com- municator, they found that someone accepts informa- tion more easily when the communicator is seen as an expert (i.e., is a good source for valid assertions) and when the communicator is seen as being trustworthy, in the sense that the source is seen as willing to com- municate the assertions he or she considers most valid (i.e., has no motives to promote a particular view or has lack of intent to persuade). (Poortinga and Pidgeon, 2003)
	•	Evidence for trust as a two-dimensional construct has been mainly found using factor-analytical statistical techniques. (Poortinga and Pidgeon, 2003)
	•	Frewer et al. (1996) found a two-factor structure that could best describe the rea- sons for trusting or distrusting various information sources, later validated with a more representative population sample. The first component comprised the characteristics: truthful, good track record, trust-worthy, favor, accurate, factual, public welfare, re- sponsible, knowledgeable, and (negatively) the characteristics: distorted, proven wrong in the past, and biased. The second factor consisted of the characteristics: accountable, self-protection, and a vested interest versus sensationalism component. (Poortinga and Pidgeon, 2003)
	•	According to Barber (1983) (see also O’Neill, 2002), the importance of full trust tends to be exag- gerated. The public has become more competent and knowledgeable enough to have “effective” distrust. Distrust in this sense is not destructive, but can be seen as an essential component of political accountability in a participatory democracy. (Poortinga and Pidgeon, 2003)
	•	Pidgeon et al. (2003) posit that what is frequently called trust or distrust exists along a continuum, ranging from uncritical emotional acceptance to (downright) rejection. (Poortinga and Pidgeon, 2003)
	•	a typology of trust is proposed that ranges from full trust to a deep type of distrust. (Poortinga and Pidgeon, 2003)
	•	management is not possible without trust (Cvetkovich, 2005)
	•	Trust results from a perception of shared values and people are likely to rely on risk managers who are trusted. (Cvetkovich, 2005)
	•	if the public trusts regulators, then they will perceive the risks to be less than when they do not trust the regulators. (Löfstedt, 2005)
	•	as the public becomes increasingly distrustful, the public is increasingly risk averse. (Löfstedt, 2005)
	•	it is much easier to lose or destroy trust than to gain it. (Löfstedt, 2005)
	•	Trust provides us with the lubrication to ease inherent frictions between society and its regulators. This concept, as defined below, helps us explain why public and interest groups have more confidence in some risk management strategies (partially dependent on their cultural and geographical background) than in others. (Löfstedt, 2005)
	•	Trust can be an expression of confidence between the parties in an exchange transaction and can either be process/system or outcome-based. (Löfstedt, 2005)
	•	In most cases, however, the public judges regulators on their past decisions (outcomes). If the public perceives the regulator to be competent, fair and efficient (the so-called three dimensions of trust) based on previous decisions, the public is highly likely to trust these regulatory bodies in the future. (Löfstedt, 2005)
	•	As Anthony Giddens argues: ‘Trust may be defined as confidence in the reliability of a person or system, regarding a given set of outcomes or events, where the confidence expresses a faith in the probity or love of another, or in the correctness of abstract principles (technical knowledge).’ (Löfstedt, 2005)
	•	Trust can be seen as a ‘complexity reduction thesis’: that is, ‘trust’ means acceptance of decisions by the constituents without questioning the rationale behind them. (Löfstedt, 2005)
	•	It is always easier to trust than to distrust. (Löfstedt, 2005)
	•	The third component of trust is efficiency and this can be viewed as how taxpayers’ money is used in the regulatory process (saving lives or safeguarding the environment). (Löfstedt, 2005)
	•	Proactive regulators, who act before a crisis is at hand, can increase public trust. (Löfstedt, 2005) 
	•	Those regulators who act retrospectively and end up ‘fire-fighting’ with a wide array of interest groups will only increase public distrust. (Löfstedt, 2005)
	•	Poortinga and Pidgeon (2003) argued that there are two components of trust: general trustworthiness, comprising such factors as fairness and competence, and a second factor which could be called vested interest (Frewer et al., 1996) or (lack of) integrity. (Sjöberg, 2008)
	•	Perceived antagonism is an important (negative) determinant of trust. (Sjöberg, 2008)
	•	People tend to rate trust at different levels, regardless of for which actor or organization they are rating their trust. (Sjöberg, 2008)
	•	Generalized trust contributes significantly to the variance of trust in anyone actor or organization. (Sjöberg, 2008)
	•	It is trust which inspires risk-taking. (Coker, 2009)
	•	trust depends on being able to deal with the unexpected, and even turn it to one’s advantage (Schmidtchen 2006:289). (Coker, 2009)
	•	Trust educates us to take sensible risks, and encourages us to defy the risk-aversive dynamic which these days is to be found at the heart of most organizations, including or even especially the military. (Coker, 2009)
	•	If people seem reluctant to talk, try asking open-ended questions, or begin with a sincere admission of your own to establish trust. (Greene, 2018)

Distrust
	•	Another important psychological tendency is that distrust, once initiated, tends to reinforce and perpetuate distrust. (Slovic, 1993)
	•	distrust tends to inhibit the kinds of personal contacts and experiences that are necessary to overcome distrust. By avoiding oth- ers whose motives or actions we distrust, we never get to see if these people are competent, well-meaning, and trustworthy. (Slovic, 1993)
	•	initial trust or distrust colors our interpretation of events, thus reinforcing our prior beliefs. (Slovic, 1993)
	•	According to Barber (1983) (see also O’Neill, 2002), the importance of full trust tends to be exag- gerated. The public has become more competent and knowledgeable enough to have “effective” distrust. Distrust in this sense is not destructive, but can be seen as an essential component of political accountability in a participatory democracy. (Poortinga and Pidgeon, 2003)
	•	Pidgeon et al. (2003) posit that what is frequently called trust or distrust exists along a continuum, ranging from uncritical emotional acceptance to (downright) rejection. (Poortinga and Pidgeon, 2003)
	•	The situation in which general trust is low, combined with low scepticism, is labeled as distrust. (Poortinga and Pidgeon, 2003)
	•	in an ‘era of distrust’, the public will turn to other sources of information and (in many cases) believe this information more than that provided by the public risk managers, even when thelatter may be more accurate. (Löfstedt, 2005)
	•	Contemporary studies indicated that the most common form of risk communication, ‘top-down’, was not successful in alleviating public fears. The public simply did not seem to be influenced by top-down risk communication programmes. The main reasons identified for this failure were poor communication among the experts themselves, and their contemptuous response to public opposition. This contributed to increased public mistrust. (Löfstedt, 2005)
Critical trust
	•	Critical trust can be conceptualized as a practical form of reliance on a person or institution combined with some healthy scepticism. (Poortinga and Pidgeon, 2003)
	•	a high degree of general trust can also co- exist with a relatively high level of scepticism. This situation could best be described as critical trust. One may be willing to rely on information, but one is still somewhat sceptical, and thus may still (construc- tively) question the correctness of the received information. (Poortinga and Pidgeon, 2003)
Cynicism
	•	Although distrust would not be a preferred situation, it could be contrasted to a more deep type of distrust: cynicism, a situation in which one not only has no trust in a specific institution, but one is also sceptical about its intentions. In the latter situation one is likely to simply reject everything that comes from a particular organization. (Poortinga and Pidgeon, 2003)
Public trust
	•	Public trust in institutions has been recognized as being an important part of the social amplification of risk framework […]. (Frewer, 2003)
	•	In this era of declining public trust it becomes increasingly difficult to communicate risks. (Löfstedt, 2005)
	•	Public trust in policy-makers, industry officials and opinion-shapers is declining in western societies. (Löfstedt, 2005)
	•	This decline in public trust appears to be related to a number of factors, including social alienation; a lack of social capital; higher levels of education and greater availability of information resulting in a more sceptical public; increased scientific pluralism leading to confusing messages; cronyism in government; growth of citizen activism in an era of complex and uncertain risks and multiple messengers; regulatory scandals, such as contaminated blood in France and BSE throughout Europe; and a hyper-critical media. (Löfstedt, 2005)
	•	Risk managers are concerned about declining public trust, which they regard as jeopardizing the efficiency of the risk management. (Löfstedt, 2005)
	•	when the public has access to many more sources of information,such as the Internet and 24-hour television, they are no longer dependent on policy-makers or risk managers for information. The result is a more knowledgeable but more sceptical public. (Löfstedt, 2005)
	•	Public perception of risk managers’ competence (one of the underlying variables of technocracy) is viewed by researchers as the most important component of trust. (Löfstedt, 2005)
	•	If the regulators are not seen as competent, thereby compromising trust, additional expertise may need to be brought into the process (e.g., scientific advisory boards). (Löfstedt, 2005)
	•	
Deliberation
	•	Deliberation, if used incorrectly, may in effect increase public/ stakeholder distrust in the policy making process. (Löfstedt, 2005)
	•	deliberation works best in situations when the public does not trust policy-makers, opinion- formers or industrialists because they are seen as unfair or partial. (Löfstedt, 2005)
	•	Deliberation may work under these specific circumstances, particularly at the local level where the public is involved (and when interest groups are kept out), assuming that the outcome of the process is adopted. (Löfstedt, 2005)
	•	Deliberation has four main purposes: normative democracy, equity and fairness, more effective risk communication, and relativism of knowledge. (Löfstedt, 2005)
	•	Deliberation comes in different forms. There are citizen advisory boards where selected citizens are asked to participate and advise on a risk management process; citizen panels and citizen juries where citizens are randomly selected to participate in a risk management decision process which may adversely affect them (e.g., building a waste-to-energy incinerator in the North Black Forest: see Chapter 3); or industry may choose other routes such as initiating dialogue processes with influential interest groups as a part of the risk management process. (Löfstedt, 2005)
	•	Although deliberative risk management techniques are currently in vogue – indeed they seem to be perceived by some policy-makers, consultants and industrialists as the only effective risk management tool – the preceding case studies suggest this is too simplistic. (Löfstedt, 2005)
	•	Deliberation often does have a role to play but the best risk management tool depends on whether, and why, the public does not trust regulators/industry in the first place. (Löfstedt, 2005)
Deliberative techniques
	•	Deliberative techniques are not useful when there is already high public trust in the regulatory process, even when decision stakes and uncertainty levels are high. In fact, deliberation in such a situation may in effect lessen public trust of the regulator. In such cases, regulators should refer to experience: that is to say, they should implement the risk management strategies they have used previously, as these strategies in the past have led to public trust. (Löfstedt, 2005)
Truth
	•	Il paraît que, comme Arlequin, j'ai dit la vérité en riant. (Dumas, 1998)
Truth teller
	•	truth teller makes a serious effort to overcome any biases or selfish interests that he might have and report the relevant facts in as fair-minded a way as he can. (Mearsheimer, 2013)
Truth telling
	•	Truth telling is when an individual does his best to state the facts and tell a story in a straightforward and honest way (Mearsheimer, 2013)
Two selves
	•	The possibility of conflicts between the remembering self and the interests of the experiencing self (Kahneman, 2012)
Two-stage clonal expansion model
	•	The two-stage clonal expansion model posits that malignant transformation of a susceptible cell is the result of two specific, rate-limiting, hereditary (at the level of the cell), and irreversible events. We emphasize that this model should not be interpreted as positing that carcinogenesis results from two specific locus mutations. Rather, this model is best interpreted within the initiation promotion progression paradigm of chemical carcinogenesis. Initiation, which confers a growth advantage on the cell, is a rare event and can be thought of as the first rate-limiting step. Mathematically, the process of initiation can reasonably be modeled by a time-dependent Poisson process. Thus, the TSCE model posits that the arrival of cells into the initiated compartment follows a Poisson proems, and that promotion consists of the clonal expansion of these cells by a stochastic birth and death process. Finally, one of the initiated cells may be converted into a malignant cell and this conversion may involve one or more mutations. (Moolgavkar and Leubeck, 2002)
U
Uncertainty
	•	Uncertainty isn’t just about the limits of knowledge. It is also about the untidiness of policy. (Stilgoe et al., 2006)
	•	Uncertainty is therefore transformed into risk when it becomes an object of management, regardless of the extent of information about probability. Indeed, as we shall see, society can demand the construction of management for issues at the limits of knowledge, making the most recalcitrant objects into risks. (Power, 2009)
	•	When uncertainty is organized it becomes a 'risk' to be managed. (Power, 2009)
	•	uncertainty in this very general sense is an analytical construct of the organizational theorist (Power, 2009)
	•	Uncertainties in the form of possibilities of financial loss, of danger and damage which may or may not be labelled risks, do not exist sui generis but must of necessity be organized, ordered, rendered thinkable, and made amenable to processes and practice of intervention (Power, 2009)
	•	Uncertainties must be organized as risks to be managed and organizations must exhibit conformity to rational risk management principles (Power, 2009)
	•	Uncertainty is ontological because, as Giddens (1991) suggests, it is an existential feature of the human condition; and yet it is always socially expressed because different societies have different ways of socially producing it, discursively portraying it, symbolically representing it and politically managing it. (Bubandt, 2005)
	•	Uncertainty is in other words ‘onto-political’. It is ontologically grounded, yet always related to a politics of certainty. (Bubandt, 2005) 
	•	uncertainty is when "the consequences of each alternative belong to some subset of all possible consequences, but. . . the decision maker cannot assign definite probabilities to the occurrence of particular consequences. (Clarke, 1999)
	•	risk and uncertainty were "categorically different," (Clarke, 1999)
	•	Uncertainty is when such estimations are not possible. (Clarke, 1999)
	•	uncertainty represents a lack of knowledge about factors affecting exposure or risk (Paustenbach, 2002a)
	•	uncertainty can lead to inaccurate or biased estimates (Paustenbach, 2002a)
	•	Uncertainly also arises from data gaps in the assessment. such as an absence of information on human exposures or the toxicity of a chemical. (Williams and Paustenbach, 2002)
	•	The key sources of variability and uncertainty in an assessment need to be clearly highlighted in the risk characterization, including a discussion of the relative importance of each of these (Williams and Paustenbach, 2002)
	•	Uncertainty is different from complexity but often results from an incomplete or inadequate reduction of complexity in modelling cause–effect chains. (Renn, 2007b)
	•	Uncertainty itself is a state of knowledge in which, although the factors influencing the issue are identified, the likelihood of any adverse effects or the effects themselves cannot be precisely described. (Great Britain and Health and Safety Executive, 2001)
	•	Uncertainty has many manifestations and they affect the approach to its handling. (Great Britain and Health and Safety Executive, 2001)
	•	the following categories appear to be appropriate in distinguishing the key components of uncertainty: target variability (based on different vulnerability of targets);• systematic and random error in modelling (based on extrapolations from animals to humans or from large doses to small doses, statistical inferentialapplications, etc); indeterminacy or genuine stochastic effects (variation of effects due torandom events, in special cases congruent with statistical handling ofrandom errors); system boundaries (uncertainties stemming from restricted models and theneed for focusing on a limited number of variables and parameters); and ignorance or non-knowledge (uncertainties derived from lack of knowledge). (Renn, 2007b)
	•	uncertainty refers to a lack of clarity over the scientific or technical basis for decision-making. (Renn, 2007b)
	•	Uncertainty is a lack of certainty, where certainty is “the personal quality of being completely sure” (FrameNet). (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Uncertainty is “a lack of certainty, involving variability and ambiguity” (Chapman & Ward, 2002), “the absence of sufficient information to predict the outcome of a project” (Brandscomb & Auerswald, 2001, p. 44), “an absence of information, knowledge, or understanding regarding the outcome of an action, decision, or event” (Heerkens, 2002, p. 142), or “the state of not being completely confident or sure” (FrameNet). (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Uncertainty implies no assessed probability or likelihood, so an uncertain event implies a range of probabilities from 0% to 100%. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Uncertainty is so pervasive that it could be paralyzing. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Strategy, defence planning, and uncertainty are interdependent in the vital sense that one cannot understand any of them without simultaneously grap- pling with the meaning and implications of the others. (Gray, 2014)
	•	Uncertainty is a condition of all human social and political life with respect to its future security. (Gray, 2014)
	•	Central to the problem of uncertainty, as opposed to mathematically defined ‘risk’ and probabilities, is a lack of information about, and understanding of, a situation and its distinct outcomes and associated likelihoods. (Frühling, 2014)
	•	Uncertainty is pervasive in defence planning, but it can be of very different kinds, and impact on the task of the defence decision-maker in different ways. (Frühling, 2014)
	•	Uncertainty reflects inadequacy of data, which is usually assumed to mean a lack of information. (Betts, 2007) Life is inherently chaotic and unpredictable. The human animal, however, does not react well to uncertainty. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Now reducing the uncertainty in a measurement is rarely free (we have to hire someone else to count the rabbits a second time), and large reductions of uncertainty can be expensive, so when uncertainty grows exponentially fast, the cost sky-rockets. (Smith and Smith, 2007).
	•	Once the uncertainty saturates in a static state, then all predictability is lost; this final distribution is called the ‘climate’ of the model. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
	•	Decreasing the noise increases her ability to determine what is more likely to happen. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
	•	All difficult decisions are made under uncertainty; understanding chaos has helped us to provide better decision support. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
	•	coping with constant uncertainty in science is not a weakness but a strength. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
Model uncertainty
	•	Recognizing model uncertainty is particularly important, as imperfect mathematical models are typically used to represent scenarios and phenomena of interest in health risk evaluations. (Williams and Paustenbach, 2002)
	•	Model uncertainty also refers to the inherent uncertainty in toxicologic tests. which entails judgment about the appropriate animal sex. strain, or species for modeling human exposures. (Williams and Paustenbach, 2002)
	•	This concerns the validity of the way chosen to represent in mathematical terms, or in an analogue fashion, the process giving rise to the risks. An example is the growth of a crack in the wall of a pressure vessel. The model would postulate the way the growth rate is affected by factors such as the material properties and the stress history to which the vessel is exposed in service. The model will provide prediction of failure in terms of time and the nature of the failure. It will inform intervention strategies such as the material specification, in-service monitoring and mitigation measures. All these factors may be modelled in many ways with the assumptions for each one open to question. The rigour of the peer review process and openness to alternative hypotheses are the main safeguards. However, the most intractable problems arise when it is not practical or physically possible to subject the alternative hypotheses to rigorous testing. In such cases, the exercise of expert judgement is paramount and confidence depends on the procedures adopted for selection of the experts and the management of bias (or appearance of bias). (Great Britain and Health and Safety Executive, 2001)
	•	Once the uncertainty saturates in a static state, then all predictability is lost; this final distribution is called the ‘climate’ of the model. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
	•	Decreasing the noise increases her ability to determine what is more likely to happen. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
Ontological uncertainty
	•	‘Ontological uncertainty’ may here be defined as the socially constructed anxiety that shapes pertinent kinds of danger, fears and concerns for a particular community at a particular time. (Bubandt, 2005)
Uncertainty management
	•	Uncertainty management, understood abstractly as lowering the costs of coordinating and monitoring, is a constitutive feature of organizations according to transactions cost theory. (Power, 2009)
	•	Others distinguish uncertainty management as “managing perceived threats and opportunities and their risk implications but also managing the various sources of uncertainty which give risk to and shape risk, threat[,] and opportunity” (Chapman & Ward, 2002, p. 10) or “the process of integrating risk management and value management approaches” (Smith, 2003, p. 2). Some authors distinguish strategic risk management, which “addresses interactions between pure and speculative risks”. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Uncertainty management: “[M]anaging perceived threats and opportunities and their risk implications but also managing the various sources of uncertainty which give rise to and shape risk, threat and opportunity” (Chapman & Ward, 2002, p. 54), or “the process of integrating risk management and value management approaches” (Smith, 2003, p. 2). (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Now reducing the uncertainty in a measurement is rarely free (we have to hire someone else to count the rabbits a second time), and large reductions of uncertainty can be expensive, so when uncertainty grows exponentially fast, the cost sky-rockets. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
Uncertainty matrix
	•	A tool to catalyse nuanced deliberations: experts must look beyond risk (top left quadrant) to ambiguity, uncertainty and ignorance using quantitative and qualitative methods. (Stirling, 2010)
Moderately uncertainty
	•	moderately uncertain issues because directly relevant data, and rela- tively good theories, are available, or conceivably could be available, with sufficient amounts of scientific and political attention, and money. (Clarke, 1999)
High uncertainty
	•	Under conditions of high uncertainty, however, the nature of planning changes in major ways. Under highly uncertain conditions rational planning becomes more difficult. (Clarke, 1999)
	•	under conditions of high uncertainty the promise and apparatus of rational planning itself becomes mainly rhetorical, becomes a means by which plans—independently of their functional relevance to the task—can be justified as reasonable promises that exigencies can be controlled. (Clarke, 1999)
Knowledge uncertainty
	•	This arises when knowledge is represented by data based on sparse statistics or subject to random errors in experiments. There are established techniques for representing this kind of uncertainty, for example confidence limits. The effect on a risk assessment is estimated by sensitivity analysis. This provides information relating to the importance of different sources of uncertainty which can then be used to prioritise further research and action, which is the only feasible way to address the uncertainty, though in some cases research may not be technically possible or cost-effective. (Great Britain and Health and Safety Executive, 2001)

Epistemic uncertainty
	•	epistemic uncertainty can be reduced by more scientific research (Renn, 2007b)
	•	can be reduced by improving the existing knowledge and by advanc- ing the present modelling tools. (Renn, 2007b)
Aleatory uncertainty
	•	aleatory uncertainty will remain fuzzy regardless of how much research is invested in the subject (Shome et al, 1998). (Renn, 2007b)
	•	characterized to some extent using scientific approaches but cannot be further resolved. (Renn, 2007b)
Remaining uncertainties
	•	Remaining uncertainties pose major problems in the later stages of risk characterization and evaluation as well as risk management since they are difficult to integrate in formal risk–benefit analyses or in setting standards. (Renn, 2007b)
Endodoxastic uncertainty
	•	Endodoxastic uncertainty is the uncertainty expressed or inherent in an assessment. It can be communicated by the assessor either in probabilistic or non-probabilistic terms. (Swedish Chemicals Agency et al., 2007)
Metadoxastic uncertainty
	•	Metadoxastic uncertainty is uncertainty about whether or not an assessment is correct, or about the choice between alternative assessments. (Swedish Chemicals Agency et al., 2007)
	•	Metadoxastic uncertainty is always present in chemical risk analysis. (Swedish Chemicals Agency et al., 2007)
Verbal uncertainty
	•	Verbal expressions of uncertainty—such as possible, probable, un- likely, may, and could—have long been recognized as sources of ambi- guity and misunderstanding. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	By themselves, most verbal expressions of uncertainty are empty shells. The reader or listener fills them with mean- ing through the context in which they are used and what is already in the reader’s or listener’s mind about that subject. (Heuer, 1999)
	•	An intelligence consumer’s interpretation of imprecise probability judgments will always be biased in favor of consistency with what the reader already believes. That means the intelligence reports will be undervalued and have little impact on the consumer’s judgment. This ambiguity can be especially troubling when dealing with low-probability, high-impact dangers against which policy- makers may wish to make contingency plans. (Heuer, 1999)
Subjective uncertainty
	•	The attitude of lawyers to scientific uncertainty is somewhat more complicated. The legal system has a time-tested system for expressing subjective uncertainty with a reasonable degree of precision: namely the standard of proof. (Weiss, 2008)

Observational uncertainty
	•	observational uncertainties are said to be caused by noise. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
Uncertainty communication
	•	Many professions have developed tools for expressing the degree of uncertainty connected with expert judgments, even though they have sometimes failed to exploit their potential in actual practice. (Weiss, 2008)
Unconscious
	•	form of thought more often by having unstructured time in which you can play with ideas, widen the options you consider, and pay serious attention to what comes to you in less conscious states of mind. form of thought more often by having unstructured time in which you can play with ideas, widen the options you consider, and pay serious attention to what comes to you in less conscious states of mind. (Greene, 2018)
Unplanned change
	•	Any unplanned change might constitute a threat to plant, personnel and environment (Wells, 1996)
Uniqueness
	•	uniqueness is revealed to us through the preferences we innately feel for particular activities or subjects of study. (Greene, 2014)
Unpredictability 
	•	There are limits to the predictability of phenomena when the outcomes are very sensitive to the assumed initial conditions. Systems that begin in the same nominal state do not end up in the same final state. Any inaccuracy in determining the actual initial state will limit our ability to predict the future and in some cases the system behaviour will become unpredictable. (Great Britain and Health and Safety Executive, 2001)
	•	Life is inherently chaotic and unpredictable. The human animal, however, does not react well to uncertainty. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Accidents and conjunctures, and curious juxtapositions of events are the very substance of history, and the "complexity of human change and the unpredictable character of the ultimate consequences of any given act or decision of men" its most conspicuous feature. (Feyerabend, 1993)
Utility-based criterion
	•	a utility-based criterion which applies to the comparison between the incremental benefits of the measures to prevent the risk of injury or detriment, and the cost of the measures. In other words, the utility-based criterion compares in monetary terms the relevant benefits (eg statistical lives saved, life-years extended) obtained by the adoption of a particular risk prevention measure with the net cost of introducing it, and requires that a particular balance be struck between the two. This balance can be deliberately skewed towards benefits by ensuring that there is gross disproportion between the costs and the benefits; (Great Britain and Health and Safety Executive, 2001)
	•	a utility-based criterion tends to ignore that there are ethical and other considerations than just achieving a balance between costs and benefits. For example, some people believe that certain hazards should not be entertained at all because they are morally unacceptable. At the other extreme, utility-based criteria do not impose an upper bound on risk, whereas we believe that there are risks that society regards as unacceptable because they entail too high a likelihood that harm will actually occur to those exposed or the consequences are too extreme, however small the likelihood of the risk being realised, to countenance exposure to the hazard; (Great Britain and Health and Safety Executive, 2001)
Expected utility
Expected utility theory
	•	Expected utility theory puts heavy demands on the information input. (Swedish Chemicals Agency et al., 2007)
Expected utility maximization
	•	Expected utility maximization is generally taken to be the risk-neutral decision rule. (Swedish Chemicals Agency et al., 2007)
Uti possidetis
	•	The uti possidetis principle has sometimes been applied in South America. The principle suggests that the newly independent states "inherited" from Spain the borders between the South American states that existed prior to independence. (Conforti, 1986)
	•	Applying the uti posseditis principle, Argentina and Chile maintainthat they inherited Antarctica from Spain. To support their claim, the two states rely upon the Bull of Pope Alexander the 7th of 1493, which, more or less, gave one half of the world to Spain and the other half to Portugal. 15 Antarctica was situated entirely in that half of the world given to Spain! (Conforti, 1986)

Utility principle
	•	The problems with the utility principle in making public policy are well known. Ken Arrow has shown that collective preferences cannot be derived by aggregating individual choices. Peter Self has illustrated the absurdity of trying to trade off incom- mensurables by reducing them to dollars or cents. Herbert Simon has shown us how decisions are made under conditions of bounded rationality and Mary Douglas has argued that the bounding of rationality is a cultural phenomenon based on differing experiences of social organization between the various institutions and constituencies that compose a complex industrial society. (Rayner and Cantor, 1987)
Utility theory
	•	Economists adopted expected utility theory in a dual role: as a logic that prescribes how decisions should be made, and as a description of how Econs make choices. (Kahneman, 2012)
Utopian thinking
	•	Utopian thinking is useless, and possibly extremely dangerous, if applied, say, to the politics of deterrence. (Giddens, 1991)
	•	Utopian prescriptions or anticipations set a baseline for future states of affairs which blocks off modernity's endlessly open character. In a post-modern world, time and space would no longer be ordered in their interrelation by historicity. (Giddens, 1991)
	•	Il est alors loisible au psychologue de déceler derrière l’utopie le desir déçu et l’angoisse sous-jacente. Il s’agi d’une fuite compensatoire et d’un processus de reparation tout à la fois. Effectivement, on sait combien il est difficile au psychisme de supporter l’épreuve de cette « douleur morale » que représente un état d’anxiété latent (ne parlons même pas des crises aiguës). Tout est alors mis en œuvre pour la déjouer, les mensonges, la mauvaise foi, la négation de la réalité, le refus de l’esprit critique, au profit des vertiges de l’imagination consolatrice. C’est probablement ce « besoin de croire », et surtout le « besoin d’être rassuré, sécurité », qui explique pour une bonne part le succès permanent du slogan des « lendemains qui chantent » : quel que soit l’idéologue ou le chef de parti qui l’exploite, il peut escompter un succès certain, car chacun préfère en général un faux espoir qu’un désespour lucide, et la vérité peut avoir des rigueurs insusportaboles. (Mannoni, 1985)
Uprising
	•	Ce sont les enthousiasmes collectifs. Apparaissant sous l’influence de facteurs psychodéterminants, à des moments de grande réceptivité du public, ces faits semblent caractérisés par la mobilisation émotionnelle générale aboutissant à une action de masse. Dans un premier temps on sensibilise les individus, puis on polarise leur attention sur le but que l’on s’est fixé. Une fois atteint le niveau émotionnel souhaité, on s’emploie à ne pas le laisser trop vite retomber. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	Qu’un contradicteur, par exemple, se manifeste dans ces moments de passion où l’intensité émotionnelle atteint parfois son comble, il sera perçu comme l’ennemi qu’il faut abattre. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	on peut dire qu’ils répondent aux grands paroxysms émotionnels. On y trouve toutes les expressions comportementales de la peur e de la colère développées à l’extrême. (Mannoni, 1985)
Urban legend
	•	Signalons enfin que certains auteurs (Brunvand, 1981) décrivent un phénomène très voisin des rumeurs sous le nom de « légendes urbaines ». (Mannoni, 1985)
Urbanism
	•	Urbanism is the modern accomplishment of the uninterrupted task which safeguards class power: the preservation of the atomization of workers whom urban conditions of production had dangerously brought together. (Debord, 2012)
	•	"The countryside shows precisely the opposite: isolation and separation" (German Ideology). The urbanism which destroys cities recomposes a pseudo-countryside which loses the natural relations of the ancient countryside as well as the direct social relations directly put into question by the historical city. (Debord, 2012)
V
Vaccine
	•	Pastor Satorras and Vespignani found that, after an initial phase of expansion, the virus can either be eradicated—it shrinks and finally disappears from the population—or become endemic—it sustains itself and infects a certain fraction of the population indefinitely. The disease is said to be below the epidemic threshold when, for every infected individual, fewer than one person gets infected: in this case, it becomes extinct. The disease is above the epidemic threshold if every infected individual passes the disease to more than one individual: in this case, it thrives. If vaccines are available, the disease can be pushed below the threshold by means of campaigns that immunize a sufficient portion of the population. Very contagious diseases are usually the hardest cases, because they have a low epidemic threshold and so they become endemic very easily. If eradication is too hard, pushing the disease closer to the threshold still has a positive effect: that is, reducing the proportion of people indefinitely affected by the endemic disease. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
Vagueness
	•	le vague, c'est le doute, et, dit le sage, dans le doute abstiens-toi. (Dumas, 1998)
Valence-based approaches
	•	valence-based approaches might by default predict that distinct emotions of the same valence, such as sadness, anger, and fear, would exert similar in ̄ uences on judgement and choice. (Lerner and Keltner, 2000)
Validation
	•	What these moments have in common is that we feel inwardly secure—not judged but accepted by friends, the group, or the loved one. We see a reflection of ourselves in others. We can relax. At our core we feel validated. Not needing to turn inward and defensive, we can direct our minds outward, beyond our ego—to a cause, a new idea, or the happiness of the other.Understand: Creating this feeling of validation is the golden key that will unlock people’s defenses. And we cannot survive and thrive in this highly competitive world without possessing such a power. (Greene, 2018)
	•	in a harsh and competitive world in which we are all prone to continual self-doubt, we almost never get this validation that we crave. When you give it to people, you will have the magical effect that occurred when you yourself were drunk, or at a rally, or in love. You will make people relax. No longer consumed by insecurities, they can direct their attention outward. Their minds open, making them susceptible to suggestion and insinuation. If they decide to help you, they feel like they are doing this of their own free will. (Greene, 2018)
Non verbal validation
	•	We can observe one other aspect to the social force, in its reverse form: when we experience a prolonged period of isolation. We know from the accounts of prisoners in solitary confinement and explorers isolated in remote regions (see Richard E. Byrd’s account of his harrowing five months in isolation in Antarctica, in his book Alone) that they begin to feel disconnected from reality and sense that their personalities are disintegrating. They become prone to elaborate hallucinations. What they miss most of all is not simply the presence of people near them but the eyes of others looking back at them. We formed our whole concept of ourselves in our first months as we looked at our mothers; her return gaze gave us a sense that we existed; she told us who we were by how she looked at us. As adults, we experience the same kind of nonverbal validation and sense of self through the eyes of others who look at us. We are never aware of this; it would take prolonged isolation to understand the phenomenon. (Greene, 2018)
Validity
Illusion of validity
	•	The unwarranted confidence which is produced by a good fit between the predicted outcome and the input information may be called the illusion of validity. (Tversky and Kahneman, 1974)
	•	This illusion persists even when the judge is aware of the factors that limit the accuracy of his predictions. (Tversky and Kahneman, 1974)
	•	The internal consistency of a pattern of inputs is a major determinant of one's confidence in predictions based on these inputs. (Tversky and Kahneman, 1974)
Increased validity
	•	‘increased validity’ claim, retain an acceptance of the significance of methodological paradigms, but remain open to the value of triangulation in generating more knowledge about a phenomenon. (Moran-Ellis, 2006)
Value
	•	Values, on the other hand, precede worldviews (Stern, Dietz, Abel, Guagnano, & Kalof, 1999) and can be seen as situation- transcending guiding principles in a person’s life (Rokeach, 1973; Schwartz, 1992). As such, values are more specific and more stable than worldviews (Schwartz & Wolfgang, 1987; Stern et al., 1999). (van der Linden, 2016)
	•	Values and beliefs are said to be 'generated' by social relationships; the former are causally pro- duced by the latter. (Boholm, 1996)
	•	détermination culturelle des valeurs : c’est l’appartenance au groupe qui fixe les croyances et leurs limites. (Mannoni, 1985)
Value system
	•	Our natural tendency is to project onto other people our own beliefs and value systems, in ways in which we are not even aware. When it comes to studying another culture, it is only through the use of our empathic powers and by participating in their lives that we can begin to overcome these natural projections and arrive at the reality of their experience. To do so we must overcome our great fear of the Other and the unfamiliarity of their ways. We must enter their belief and value systems, their guiding myths, their way of seeing the world. Slowly, the distorted lens through which we first viewed them starts to clear up. Going deeper into their Otherness, feeling what they feel, we can discover what makes them different and grasp their reality. This ability to understand from the inside-out is an essential part of mastery. (Greene, 2014)
	•	The key to employing empathy within a relationship is to understand the value system of the other person, which inevitably is different from yours. What they interpret as signs of love or attention or generosity tends to diverge from your way of thinking. These value systems are largely formed in early childhood and are not consciously created by people. Keeping in mind their value system will allow you to enter their spirit and perspective precisely in the moment you would normally turn defensive. (Greene, 2018)
	•	détermination culturelle des valeurs : c’est l’appartenance au groupe qui fixe les croyances et leurs limites. (Mannoni, 1985)
Egoistic value
	•	The reason why egoistic value orientations correlate with individualistic worldviews and social values correlate with egalitarian worldviews is precisely because values precede and are more fundamental than “cultural worldviews,” and, as such, average value priorities are a more natural proxy for shared enculturation (De Groot, Steg, & Poortinga, 2013; van der Linden, 2015). (van der Linden, 2016)
Value of a Statistical Life 
	•	[…] VSL estimates in turn provide governments with a reference point for assessing the benefits of risk reduction efforts. (Viscusi and Aldy, 2003)
	•	A potentially fundamental concern with respect to use of VSL estimates in different contexts is how these values vary with income. (Viscusi and Aldy, 2003)
	•	VSL reflects the wage-risk tradeoffs that reflect the preferences of workers in a given sample. (Viscusi and Aldy, 2003)
	•	VSL literature attempts to evaluate the VSL (the constructed dependent variable) as a function of a number of studies’ characteristics (such as mean income of the sample population, mean mortality risk, and econometric specification). (Viscusi and Aldy, 2003)
Value-belief-norm theory
	•	The value-belief-norm theory described by Stern et al. (1999; Stern, 2000) links three theoretical mod- els: norm-activation theory, the theory of personal values, and the new ecological paradigm, into a unified explanation for environmentalism. The integration of these theories leads to a hypothesized causal chain of five types of variables: personal values, a general set of beliefs or worldview, in this case the new ecological paradigm of Dunlap and Van Liere (1978; Dun- lap et al., 2002), awareness of consequences, ascription of responsibility, and personal norms for pro- environmental action. (Slimak and Dietz, 2006)
	•	While the VBN theory is in- tended to explain behavior, embedded within it is a theory of environmental beliefs. The theory pos- tulates that values, and especially concern with the well-being of other humans and the biosphere (i.e., altruism), are at the core of environmental perceptions. (Slimak and Dietz, 2006)
Vapor pressure
	•	Vapor pressure is an important property governing the tendency of a chemical substance to be transported in air and is thus an important parameter in pre- dicting the distribution of chemicals into environmental compartments. 
	•	The vapor pressure of any chemical increases with an increase in temperature. This is because as temperature increases, the kinetic energy or movement of molecules increases, and more high-energy molecules are available to escape into the gaseous state. (Paustenbach, 2002b)
Equilibrium vapor
	•	Equilibrium vapor pressure can be thought of as the solubility of a chemical substance in air and is dependent on the nature of the chemical and temperature. (Paustenbach, 2002b)
Vapor pressure
	•	Vapor pressure values are, therefore, meaningful only if accompanied by the temperature at which they were measured. (Paustenbach, 2002b)
Vengeance
	•	A tous maux il est deux remèdes : le temps et le silence. (Dumas, 1998)
Vector
Attack vector
	•	Sandia National Laboratories identified a number of attack vectors, where each is “an avenue or tool that a threat uses to launch attacks, gather information, or deliver/leave a malicious item or items in thosedevices, systems, or networks” (Mateski et al., 2012, p. 23). (Newsome, 2013)
Vector Autoregression applied to news attention
	•	VAR models enable a test on Granger causality: Cross- lagged causal influences are plausible only if a process cannot be explained from autoregressive forces. The current values of a set of variables is regressed on their previous values, on previous values of the dependent variable (autoregression) and on cross-lagged influences of the other variables, as in Equation 1 with two variables x and y and one time lag only. (Kleinnijenhuis et al., 2015)
	•	The VAR model assumes independent deviations from its predictions (normal distributed residuals) across different values of the independent variables (homoscedasticity) and across different points in time (stationarity). (Kleinnijenhuis et al., 2015)
Verbal discourse
	•	Verbal discourse is not a mere reflexion of principles for interaction. In social interaction as well as in the constitution of individual persons, the verbal accounts that people pro-duce and exchange is a formative and constructive force that should be studied in its own right (Boholm, 1996)
Vernacular security
	•	‘vernacular security’ is a convenient term for the analysis of different scales of creating imagined communities through a comparison of different but constantly interpenetrating political forms of management of threat and (un)certainty. (Bubandt, 2005)
	•	I propose to call the contradictory outcome of these processes ‘vernacular security’. The notion of the vernacular is inspired by recent anthropological studies of global modernity (Appadurai, 1996; Knauft, 2002; Piot, 1999; Rofel, 1999). This research reveals a perhaps self-evident but nevertheless paradoxical fact: global modernity is always site-specific. (Bubandt, 2005)
	•	Vernacular security is thus an attempt to combine a critical, discursive analysis of security with an anthropological approach to the study of ontological uncertainty that does not reduce local ontologies of uncertainty to current political (and political science) conceptualizations of security. (Bubandt, 2005)
Versatility 
	•	Functional flexibility, or‘versatility’, is the ability of a given unit to switch between different roles, or perform several roles at once, such as combat operations, peacekeeping, humanitarian assistance or training of friendly forces. (Frühling, 2014)
Victim
First-party victims 
	•	first-party victims are the operators (Perrow, 1999)
	•	First-party victims are the operators of the system. (Perrow, 1999)
	•	Most industrial accidents involve operators; in fact, most involve only one operator. Most industrial accidents are attributed to "operator error" or "human error" by those who study and seek to prevent such accidents. (Perrow, 1999)

Second-party victims 
	•	second-party victims are nonoperating personnel or system users such as passengers on a ship (Perrow, 1999)
	•	Second-party victims are those associated with the system as suppliers or users, but without influence over it (Perrow, 1999)
	•	To some extent they "choose" to participate in the system, and thus elect to share at least some of the risk. (Perrow, 1999)
Grandiose victim
	•	A variation on this is the grandiose victim—they have suffered a lot and been the victim numerous times. Although they may like to frame it as being simply unlucky and unfortunate, you will notice that they often have a tendency to fall for the worst types in intimate relationships, or put themselves in circumstances in which they are certain to fail and suffer. In essence, they are compelled to create the drama that will turn them into a victim. As it turns out, any relationship with them will have to revolve around their needs; they have suffered too much in the past to attend to your needs. They are the center of the universe. Feeling and expressing their misfortune gives them their sense of importance, of being superior in suffering. (Greene, 2018)
Third-party victims 
	•	third-party victims are innocent bystanders (Perrow, 1999)
	•	Third-party victims, innocent bystanders, have no such involvement in the system (Perrow, 1999)

Fourth-party victims 
	•	fourth-party victims are futures and future generations. (Perrow, 1999)
	•	Fourth-party victims are, for the most part, victims of radiation and toxic chemicals. They are fetuses being carried at the time of exposure; the would-be children that damaged parents will not be able to conceive; stillborn or deformed children conceived after exposure; and all those people who will be contaminated in the future by residual substances, including those substances that will become concentrated as they move up the foodchain. (Perrow, 1999)
	•	The importance of fourth-party victims in risk analysis is growing with the increasing concern and sophistication about the long-term consequences of some systems. (Perrow, 1999)
	•	Fourth-party victims potentially constitute the most serious class of victims. (Perrow, 1999)
Victory
	•	‘Victory’ now meant ensuring that war never broke out. (Coker, 2009)
	•	Victory is not the characteristic of an organization but rather a result of organizational activity. (Coker, 2009)
Video
Dramatized video
	•	Dramatized video has been found to increase identification with characters, enhancing the degree of narrative engagement (7), promoting acceptance of the information being presented, and creating episodic memories that are easier to recall in similar situations (14). (Downs, 2014)
Interactive video
	•	Communicating science through interactive video narrative thus has the potential to be a powerful, self-reinforcing medium, akin to video games. (Downs, 2014)
	•	This approach exploits the somewhat ad- dictive nature of video entertainment in which the audience loses track of time, repeating variations on the same tasks over and over and getting efficient at them (55). (Downs, 2014)

View
Inside view
	•	The inside view is the one that all of us, including Seymour, spontaneously adopted to assess the future of our project. (Kahneman, 2012)

Outside view
	•	The outside view is implemented by using a large database, which provides information on both plans and outcomes for hundreds of projects all over the world, and can be used to provide statistical information about the likely overruns of cost and time, and about the likely underperformance of projects of different types. (Kahneman, 2012)

Violence
Privatization of violence
	•	the privatization of violence as fundamentalist and terrorist groups sought to purchase the most destructive weapons they could. (Coker, 2009)
	•	Although the privatization of violence was not of great concern for much of the twentieth century, in retrospect it should have been. (Coker, 2009)
Vital space
	•	"vital space" is only the disappearance of European geography, become an area, a desert without qualities, expanded by a "social" organization made entirely functional by the hierarchy of speed […] (Virilio, 2006)
Vividness
	•	Vividness, and hence the strength of anticipatory emotions, depends not only on individual differences in mental imagery ability, but also on situational factors, such as how an outcome is described. (Loewenstein et al., 2001)
	•	The effect of vividness on emotional responses to risk may help explain some common patterns of insurance purchase behavior that are anomalous within the consequentialist framework. (Loewenstein et al., 2001)
	•	Psychologists Richard Nisbett and Lee Ross point out that the vividness of information (i.e., its concreteness or its proximity in sensory, temporal or spatial way) affects how people assign weights to data. (Honig, 2007)
	•	Vivid information is likely to attract attention and excite the imagination. (Honig, 2007)
	•	The most serious implication of vividness as a criterion that determines the impact of evidence is that certain kinds of very valuable evidence will have little influence simply because they are abstract. Statistical data, in particular, lack the rich and concrete detail to evoke vivid images, and they are often overlooked, ignored, or minimized. (Heuer, 1999)
Vivid probabilities
	•	The idea that fluency, vividness, and the ease of imagining contribute to decision weights gains support from many other observations. (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	The power of format creates opportunities for manipulation, which people with an axe to grind know how to exploit (Kahneman, 2012)
Virtual individual
	•	The concept of the virtual individual is a powerful tool in assessing safety. (Cook, 2008)
	•	The virtual bystander is subject to the non-involved risk criterion. (Cook, 2008)
Virus
	•	Viruses are by definition silent and invisible killers which proliferate and survive by infecting the cells of a host organism by stealth. Often we don’t know we are infected until it is too late. (Coker, 2009)
	•	Viruses instil fear because they are so perfectly suited to their ultimate purpose of preying on other forms of life. (Coker, 2009)
Computer virus
	•	Some features of a computer virus infection are strikingly similar to real-world epidemics. A computer becomes infected through its connections (for example, the social contacts of its owner as sampled by his or her email network) and infects others similarly. Some of the conclusions reach destinational of theed for diseases explain the puzzling behaviour of computer viruses. Even if antivirus programs are quickly updated, some viruses still circulate years after their first strike. This is no surprise if one considers the features of an epidemic spreading in scale-free networks: even if a large proportion of computers are immunized through antivirus programs, this is not enough to eradicate the infection: there is always some high-degree node here or there that puts it back in circulation. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
	•	This characteristic of endurance, which is a real problem with computer viruses, can be turned into a resource if one wants to disseminate information in a heterogeneous network. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
Virus spread
	•	Pastor Satorras and Vespignani found that, after an initial phase of expansion, the virus can either be eradicated—it shrinks and finally disappears from the population—or become endemic—it sustains itself and infects a certain fraction of the population indefinitely. The disease is said to be below the epidemic threshold when, for every infected individual, fewer than one person gets infected: in this case, it becomes extinct. The disease is above the epidemic threshold if every infected individual passes the disease to more than one individual: in this case, it thrives. If vaccines are available, the disease can be pushed below the threshold by means of campaigns that immunize a sufficient portion of the population. Very contagious diseases are usually the hardest cases, because they have a low epidemic threshold and so they become endemic very easily. If eradication is too hard, pushing the disease closer to the threshold still has a positive effect: that is, reducing the proportion of people indefinitely affected by the endemic disease. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
Vision
Tunnel vision
	•	in order to learn a subject or skill, paritucarly on that is complex, we must immerse ourselves in many details, techniques, and procedures that are standard for solving problems. If we are not careful, however, we become locked into seeing every problem in the same way, using the same techniques and strategies that became so imprinted in us. It is always simpler to follow such a route. In the process we lose sigh of the bigger picture, the purpose of what we are doing, how each problem we face is different an requires a different approach. We adopt of kind of tunnel vision. (Greene, 2014)
Vocotion
	•	vocation. The word “vocation” comes from the Latin meaning to call or to be called. Its use in relation to work began in early Christianity—certain people were called to a life in the church; that was their vocation. They could recognize this literally by hearing a voice from God, who had chosen them for this profession. The voice in this case that is calling you is not necessarily coming from God, but from deep within. It emanates from your individuality. It tells you which activities suit your character. And at a certain point, it calls you to a particular form of work or career. Your work then is something connected deeply to who you are.  (Greene, 2014)
Voice
	•	The voice says a lot about people’s level of confidence and their contentment. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Perhaps the most telling indication of positive emotions comes from the voice. It is much easier for us to control the face; we can look in a mirror for such purposes. But unless we are professional actors, the voice is very difficult to consciously modulate. When people are engaged and excited to talk to you, the pitch of their voice rises, indicating emotional arousal. Even if people are nervous, the tone of the voice will be warm and natural, as opposed to the simulated warmth of a salesman. (Greene, 2018)
	•	You can detect an almost purring quality to the voice, which some have likened to a vocal smile. You will notice also an absence of tension and hesitation. In the course of a conversation there is an equal level of banter, with the pace quickening, indicating increasing rapport. A voice that is animated and happy tends to infect us with the mood and elicit a similar response. We know it when we feel it, but often we ignore these feelings and instead concentrate on the friendly words or sales pitch. (Greene, 2018)
Voters
	•	Voters have a responsibility to learn. (Nichols, 2017)
	•	Only voters can resolve among the choices that a ect their families and for their coun- try, and only they bear the ultimate responsibility for those decisions. (Nichols, 2017)
Vulnerability
	•	Vulnerability is a multidimensional, dynamic process based on levels of exposure to stressors, which typically relate to physical location, social class, and demographic characteristics. (Gill et al., 2012)
	•	a group may be highly vulnerable to one type of risk yet may be much less vulnerable to other types of risks, depending on the resources at stake and the efficacy to prepare and respond. (Gill et al., 2012)
	•	Vulnerability refers to uncertainty about and severity of the consequences (or outcomes) as a result of the source occurring. (Renn, 2011)
	•	The issue of vulnerability necessitates a clear distinction between an “agent” (risk source) such as an earthquake or a chemical and the “risk absorbing system” such as a building or an organism. (Renn, 2011)
	•	Vulnerability refers to the quality of the risk absorbing system to withstand or tolerate different degrees or compositions of the agent to which it may be exposed. (Renn, 2011)
	•	Vulnerability essentially means that the target can be harmed by the threat.. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Vulnerability is routinely conflated with exposure. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	In general use, vulnerability is “the state of being exposed to or likely to suffer harm” (FrameNet). (Newsome, 2013)
	•	The Humanitarian Practice Network (2010) defined vulnerabilities as “factor that increase an organization’s exposure to threats, or make severe outcomes more likely” (p. 42). (Newsome, 2013)
	•	Essentially, vulnerability means that we are undefened against the threat. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	David Alexander (2000, p. 13) defined vulnerability as the “potential for casualty, destruction, damage, disruption or other form of loss in a particular element,” but this sounds the same as risk. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	The Humanitarian Practice Network (2010, p. 28) defined vulnerability as “the likelihood or probability of being confronted with a threat, and the consequences or impact if and when that happens,” but this also sounds the same as risk. (Newsome, 2013)
	•	In simple terms, vulnerabilities are opportunities. More precisely, they are weaknesses or gaps in a security program that can be exploited by threats to gain unauthorized access to an asset. Vulnerabilities include structural, proce- dural, electronic, human, and other elements that provide opportunities to attack assets. Vulnerabilities can be categorized as physical, technical, or operational. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	The vulnerability of an asset is determined by the potential weaknesses in operational processes and procedures, physical security weaknesses, and technical gaps that can be exploited to attack an asset. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	Vulnerabilities are opportunities. They are weaknesses or gaps in a security program that can be exploited by threats to gain unauthorized access to an asset. Vulnerabilities may be structural, procedural, electronic, and human and provide opportunities to attack assets. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	Vulnerabilities may also be classified quantitatively or qualitatively. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	A vulnerability is a saw or oversight in an existing control that may possibly allow a threat agent to exploit it to gain unauthorized access to organizational assets. (Landoll, 2011)
	•	Vulnerabilities are important elements of a security risk assessment because they are instrumental in determining existing and residual risk. Without vulnerabilities, there would be no risk. (Landoll, 2011)
	•	According to Webster’s ‘vulnerability’ is “the state or property of being vulnerable” where vulnerable re- fers to: “1. capable of being wounded or physically in- jured...; 2. open to criticism or attack...; 3. open to at- tack or assault by armed forces. ...; 4. in contract bridge, liable to increase penalties and entitled to increased bonuses”; or “the quality or state of being vulnerable”. (Brauch, 2011)
	•	British dictionaries offer additional meanings: “someone who is vulnerable is easily harmed or hurt emotionally, or morally”; “susceptible to injury, exposed to damage by weapon, criticism, etc.”; as well as: “open to temptation, censure etc.”; as “unpro- tected against attack; liable to be hurt or damaged”. (Brauch, 2011)
	•	The vulnerability concept is defined in encyclopaedias in the geosciences where the referent object of ‘vulnerability’ are both human beings, especially children, and the environment. (Brauch, 2011)
	•	The vulnerability concept is used in the global change literature (Steffen/Sander- son/Tyson/Jäger/Matson/MooreIII/Oldfield/Richardson/Schellnhuber/Turner/Wasson 2004), on climate change impacts (IPCC 2001a, 2007a) and in the disaster community (ISDR 2004). (Brauch, 2011)
	•	Vulnerability results from “poverty, exclusion, marginalization and inequities in material consumption”, and it is generated by “social, economic and political processes” (Barnett 2001: 132–133). (Brauch, 2011)
	•	In the context of the precautionary principle O’Riordan (2002: 369) defined vulnerability at the societal level as: “the incapacity to avoid danger, or to be uninformed of impending threat, or to be so politically powerless and poor as to be forced to live in conditions of danger”. (Brauch, 2011)
	•	For Oliver-Smith (2004: 10) “vulnerability is fundamentally a political ecological concept”. As a theoret- ical framework “vulnerability can become a key con- cept in translating that multi-disciplinarity into the concrete circumstances of life that account for a disaster”. He argues that disasters “are channelled and dis- tributed in the form of risk within society to political, social and economic practices and institutions”. (Brauch, 2011)
	•	Wilches-Chaux (1989: 20 – 41, 1993) identified 11 types of vulnerability, “natural, physical, economic, social, political, technical, ideological, cultural, educational, ecological and institutional vulnerability”. (Brauch, 2011)
	•	For Oliver- Smith (2004: 11) “vulnerability is conceptually located at the interaction of nature and culture” that also links “social and economic structures, cultural norms and values and environmental hazards”. (Brauch, 2011)
	•	Nathan (2009: 1125) characterized vulnerability “as a complex process encompassing multiple intricate dimensions” that is constantly changing. (Brauch, 2011)
Physical vulnerabilities
	•	Physical vulnerabilities may include structural characteristics of the facility, accessibility by outsiders, geographic location of facility and location of assets within the facility, strength of access control measures, and illumination levels. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	Physical vulnerabilities are those vulnerabilities that exist in the physical, geographical, personnel, or utility provisioning controls. (Landoll, 2011)
Technical vulnerabilities
	•	Technical vulnerabilities may include equipment properties, network weaknesses, susceptibility to eavesdropping and other electronic surveillance, effectiveness of locks, and type and number of cameras. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	Technical vulnerabilities are those that exist in the logical controls in the organization’s system. (Landoll, 2011)
Operational vulnerabilities
	•	Operational vulnerabilities may include policies, procedures, practices, and personnel actions and behavior. (Vellani, 2007)
Administrative vulnerabilities 
	•	Administrative vulnerabilities are those vulnerabilities that exist in policies, procedures, or security activities. (Landoll, 2011)
Vulnerability assessment
	•	A vulnerability assessment is a systematic approach used to assess a facility’s security posture and analyze the effectiveness of the existing security program at the facility. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	The basic process of a vulnerability assessment first determines what assets are in need of protection by the facility’s security program, then identifies the protection measures already in place to secure those assets and what gaps in protection exist. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	Finally, the assessment measures the security program’s effectiveness against valid security metrics and provides recommen- dations to security decision makers for improvements. In essence, the vulnerability assessment assists security decision makers in determining the need for additional security measures, security equipment upgrades, changes in policies and procedures, and manpower needs. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	Vulnerability assessments identify security weaknesses that can be exploited by an adversary to gain access to the organization’s assets. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	The goal of vulnerability assessments is to ensure life safety, protect assets, and promote continuity of operations. The driving forces behind vulnerability assessments include new legislation, revised threat assessments with new or emerging threats, increased criticality of assets, concern for continuity of operations, and newly recognized vulnerabilities. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	 A comprehensive vulnerability assessment affords security decision makers and facility management personnel the opportunity to make future planning decisions based on an acceptable methodology that can be used for budget considerations, capital expenditures, personnel allocation, and procedural guidelines. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	Vulnerability assessments identify security weaknesses that can be exploited by an adversary to gain access to the organization’s assets. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	Vulnerability assessments are used to identify these weaknesses by way of a security survey. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	The scope of a vulnerability assessment depends on the goal of the security team. Some assessments are geared toward protecting only the most critical assets, such as an assessment that emphasizes only the reduction of violent crime opportunities to protect people at the facility. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	Other vulnerability assessments emphasize the full range of opportunity-reduction strategies for all critical assets and lesser assets. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	The threat assessment, for example, which is normally conducted prior to the vulnerability assessment, may have identified and prioritized threats, and these high-ranking threats serve as the scope of the vulnerability assessment. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	Key to the vulnerability assessment is project management. The vulnerability assessment team leader is best suited to take on the role of project manager. Project management includes defining the scope of the assessment, refining the security survey for the unique needs of the facility, and determining a project work plan, time line, and milestones. The project manager should also define the role of each assessment team member and arrange for all resources needed for the assessment, such as light meters, facility access, and measuring tape. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	Vulnerabilities are calculated using the probability that each specific vulnerability will be exploited by an adversary. Based on the threat and vulnerability calculations, the overall risk level is calculated. (Vellani, 2007)
	•	When assessing vulnerabilities in the system, it is useful to categorize the vulnerabilities according to administrative, physical, and technical areas, since the departments or personnel are likely to be distributed similarly. (Landoll, 2011)
Vulnerability scanning
	•	Vulnerability scanning is the testing of the external or internal interfaces of a sys- tem in order to identify obvious vulnerabilities. (Landoll, 2011)
W
Walk
	•	He would watch people walking in every part of the city. He paid attention to the heaviness of the step—there was the emphatic walk of those who were persistent and full of resolve; the light step of those who seemed more indecisive; the loping, fluid walk of those who seemed rather lazy; the meandering walk of the person lost in thought. He observed closely the extra swaying of the hips or the strut that seemed to elevate the head, indicating high levels of confidence in a person. There was the walk that people put on to cover up some weakness or insecurity—the exaggerated masculine stride, the nonchalant shuffle of the rebellious teenager. He took note of the sudden changes in people’s walk as they became excited or nervous. All of this supplied him endless information about people’s moods and Self-confidence. (Greene, 2018)
	•	In his office, he placed his desk at the far end of the room, making his patients walk toward him. He would notice changes in the walk from before to after the session. He would scrutinize their way of sitting down, the level of tension in their hands as they grasped the arms of the chair, the degree to which they would face him as they talked, and in a matter of a few seconds, without words being exchanged, he had a profound read on their insecurities and rigidities, as mapped clearly in their body language. (Greene, 2018)
War
	•	La guerre est sans doute, de tous les cas, le plus significative. Les combats, les bombardements engendrent des ébranlements émotionnels importants qui peuvent se traduire soit par la panique, la fuite éperdue, des états de sidération, des états confusionnels ou crépusculaires (ce qui realise le tableau Classique de l’accès d’angoisse suraiguë), soit par des troubles névrotiques ou psychosomatiques plus ou moins systématisés. (Mannoni, 1985)
War (military)
	•	‘war in general is composed of both forms of war, or constituted jointly by both’, and that ‘the events and operations which take place in the course of a campaign belong, in part, to the domain of Small War, in part to the domain of Major War’ (Heuser, 2010a)
	•	‘War’, Clausewitz famously asserted, ‘is simply a continuation of political intercourse with the addition of other means’. By arguing that war was a means to achieve political ends, Clausewitz sought to define the rationality of war rather than its ‘grammar’. (Rasmussen, 2001)
	•	War has a meaning shared by no other form of violence (for example a bar brawl) because it is defined as a means to ends beyond the acts of violence themselves. The purpose of war is to use military means for political ends. (Rasmussen, 2001)
	•	Wars are often inconclusive; they don’t always end when hostilities cease or armistices are signed. (Coker, 2009)
	•	war is about interests, not values. (Coker, 2009)
	•	War has been scaled down, as too has our strategic ambition; the West is no longer in the business of building a New World Order but managing the Global Disorder instead. (Coker, 2009)
	•	Wars are the result of tensions that observe a power law, for the smallest (or biggest) event can tip them over into conflict. (Coker, 2009)
	•	War has become increasingly complex and as a result increasingly indecisive. (Coker, 2009)
	•	As war became more complex, so those who practised it had to anticipate the consequences for themselves, for the larger economy, for social and political stability at home, as well as in the international order. (Coker, 2009)
	•	war for some countries became a metaphysical ideal designed especially in fascist ideology to test the superior ‘will to power’ of the participants. (Coker, 2009)
	•	War was becoming faster. Speed has always been central to the successful prosecution of war − getting an army onto the battlefield first and outmanoeuvring an enemy − but in the industrial era speed became some- thing of an addiction, and a dangerous one at that. (Coker, 2009)
	•	War is becoming not only dangerous, it is also becoming incredibly difficult to wage with success. (Coker, 2009)
	•	War seems to have escaped the narrow parameters that it was given in the course of the twentieth century − deterrence and defence. Its principal theme is now security in its various, often mutually exclusive forms. (Coker, 2009)
	•	Military power and war should not be conceived as self-referential. They do not compound to constitute a masterful independent variable, with politics demoted logically to a dependent status that expresses the consequences of the course of military strategic events. (Coker, 2009)
	•	Because war is a political act, civilian authority should always be superior to military experience. (Coker, 2009)
	•	War is a creative venture that has the nature of a duel. (Gray, 2014)
	•	War thus has a political logic, but also a ‘grammar’ of its own that constrains and conditions the ways its politica logic can be expressed through the use of armed force. (Frühling, 2014)
Warfare
	•	Carl von Clausewitz famously defined warfare as the use of armed force as a means of politics. (Rasmussen, 2006)
Urban warfare
	•	Urban warfare is not only timeless, it involves significant collateral damage. It is the closest the West has come to pre-industrial forms of warfare (Hills 2007:116). And the cities of the future in which Western forces are likely to be deployed will have even larger populations of underemployed, or unemployable, young males, precisely the group most likely to follow the lead of charismatic leaders. (Coker, 2009)

Warfare debate
	•	Public debate about warfare tends to focus on issues of legality, ethics, and occasionally politics. (Gray, 2014)
Nature of warfare
	•	The nature of warfare for exam- ple has already changed significantly in the last twenty years, and fur- ther changes are only to be expected as new technology is applied and as potential adversaries alter their own tactics in response. (Omand, 2014)
	•	strong forces are changing the nature of power relationships, diluting the control of individual gov- ernments, deepening interdependence across borders and empowering a far wider range of actors emerging on to the world stage, not just states but also private companies, NGOs, terrorist organizations, and transnational criminal networks that corrupt state governance and facilitate and profit from violent conflict. (Omand, 2014)
Guerrilla war
	•	They viewed the guerrilla war eventually to be conducted as springing from the same political and social roots as military and governmental reform. (Hahlweg, 1986)
	•	Clausewitz goes beyond his lectures, perceiving guerrilla war as a general uprising, as a people's war of liberation or resistance. (Hahlweg, 1986)
	•	Clausewitz presents some theoretical reflections on the nature of defense (tactical and strategical) and thereby introduces guerrilla warfare into the general theory of war. (Hahlweg, 1986)
	•	he calls the popular uprising (using the means of guerrilla warfare) a major means of salvation ('Rettungsmitte’). As a 'natural expression of national forces melded together', guerrilla war is, for Clausewitz, 'the last and desperate resort'. (Hahlweg, 1986)
	•	he was the first to include guerrilla warfare in the context of modern military theory. (Hahlweg, 1986)
	•	Under the topic of arming the people, Clausewitz first pinpoints the moral impulse of the guerrilla fighters as essential to the general uprising. (Hahlweg, 1986)
	•	Clausewitz then lists five conditions required for the effectiveness of a general uprising: 1. the war must be fought in the interior of the country; 2.it must not be decided by a single stroke of the enemy 
('Katastrophe') ; 3.the theatre of operations must constitute a 'considerable region'; 4. the national character must be suited to this type of armed confrontation; 5. The terrain must be rough and inaccessible because of mountains, 
forests, swamps, or 'the local methods of cultivation'. 
 (Hahlweg, 1986)
	•	Clausewitz describes the nature of guerrilla war with words that are in some aspects still applicable today: A general uprising should be 'nebulous and elusive; its resistance should never materialize as a concrete body, otherwise the enemy can direct sufficient force at its core, crush it, and take many prisoners. When that happens, the people will lose heart and, believing that the issue has been decided and further efforts would be useless, drop their weapons.' (Hahlweg, 1986)
	•	Finally Clausewitz incorporates guerrilla warfare (arming the people) into the general plan of strategic defense: it could be either the last resort after a defeat or the natural auxiliary before a decisive battle. (Hahlweg, 1986)
	•	Clausewitz' studies of guerrilla warfare, 'the people's war', show that he appropriately incorporated this form of armed conflict into military theory (Hahlweg, 1986)
	•	the Guerrilla had the dimension of a popular uprising or insurgency, with a political cause, which the Small Wars of the mercenary partisans of the ancien régime had lacked. (Heuser, 2010a)
	•	
People war
	•	'The people's war' will become actively effective precisely upon the invasion of the victors — a thought that indeed finds verification in the events of the Second World War (for example, the German invasions of Yugoslavia and the USSR). (Hahlweg, 1986)

Small war
	•	Clausewitz gives an overview of this form of warfare which he distinguishes from large-scale warfare by the sheer number of operating troop units: 'Small-scale warfare is to be defined', he wrote, 'as the use of small troop units in the field. Engagements of 20, 50, 100 or 300, 400 men, if they are not part of a greater action, belong to the small-scale war'. (Hahlweg, 1986)
	•	Usage of the term ‘Small War’ itself goes back at least to the early seventeenth century, where it is found as in Spanish as ‘guerrilla’ in 1611 in the dictionary of Sebastian de Covarrubias. By the eighteenth century, the term is widely known, especially in French military literature, as ‘petite guerre’, or in English as ‘Small War’, and in German as ‘der Kleine Krieg’. (Heuser, 2010a)
	•	This referred to small-scale military operations that were usually conducted by small ‘detachments’ of often irregular forces on the fringes of major operations by regular forces. (Heuser, 2010a)
	•	Clausewitz, Small War was thus a special form of military operations, in which battalions of infantrists were deployed, sometimes also cavalry, in special ‘detachments’ in order to reconnoitre enemy positions. (Heuser, 2010a)
	•	Small War in Early Modern History, until Clausewitz’s times, was thus really an auxiliary part of major war. (Heuser, 2010a)
	•	The majority of authors, Clausewitz among them, assumed that Small War would be a side show to the main confrontations of regular forces. (Heuser, 2010a)
	•	Rühle opined, that writers had such problems with the definition of Small War. On the whole, ‘the domain of Small War was that of operations of smaller scale and employment of resources, while the deployment of the armed forces as a whole, and the decisive strikes, would be sought in the domain of Major War’. And yet he noted that Small Wars ‘in certain circumstances could reach such a scope that several thousands [of combatants], indeed, the larger part of the existing and assembled forces, might have to be used for its purpose. Some authors’, he continued, ‘have seen Small War’ as essentially only the ‘operations of light forces, yet light forces are being used in our current style of warfare just as frequently in Major War . . .’. And vice versa: in special circumstances, regular, heavily armed forces might be used in Small Wars. (Heuser, 2010a)
	•	‘Small warfare has the peculiar characteristic that it couples extreme boldness and courage with a much greater fear of danger than in major war. This characteristic is shared by the troops that conduct it. The individual Hussar or Ja ̈ ger has an enterprising spirit, a degree of self-reliance and faith in his own luck which is almost unimaginable to somebody who has always served in line [among the regulars]. In the light of his experience and customs, he feels calm and unruffled while carrying out diverse and difficult missions which would make a [regular soldier] very anxious. By contrast, the Hussar and Jäger has a greater respect for the dangers of a regular battle than soldiers in regular formations. If it is not for dire necessity, he would not expose himself to it, but would retreat and seek cover as often as he can. A single cannon shot can keep troops at a great distance, if they do not carry cannon with them and [thus] feel disadvantaged. 100 infantrists could thus keep whole cavalry regiments at bay, if these saw the terrain of the infantrists as advantageous to these and perceived an asymmetry’. (Clausewitz) (Heuser, 2010a)
Major war
	•	Major wars often begin with sudden attacks. (Hopple, 1984)
Modern war
	•	‘Modern war’, explained Quincy Wright, ‘tends to be about words more than about things, about potentialities, hopes and aspirations more than about facts, grievances and conditions’ (C. H. Gray 1997:97). (Coker, 2009)

War victory
	•	Wars have increasingly been won through attrition because they have been increasingly determined by economic and social factors, as much as by the performance of armies on a battlefield. (Coker, 2009)
War virtue
	•	The primary virtue in war is not speed, it is intelligence. (Coker, 2009)

Preindustrial war
	•	Wars in the pre-industrial era had been determined by finite inputs. (Coker, 2009)
Industiralze war
	•	Industrialized warfare introduced a new factor into war; the country (or coalition of countries) that won would do so by out- producing its enemies. (Coker, 2009)
World war
	•	World wars by contrast involved abundance, not scarcity: abundant manpower, weapons and even a space of operations which in the end turned the whole world into a theatre of conflict. (Coker, 2009)
Nuclear war
	•	Nuclear wars, like all others, have winners and losers. (CIA, 1978)
Wartime
	•	In wartime the essential problem lies in measuring the results of interacting capabilities and judging their significance. (Betts, 2007)
War planning
	•	War planning is potently but in appropriately exclusive in focus, at least in the literal meaning of words; it is necessary to plan for peace (perhaps warlike peace) as well as for war. (Gray, 2014)
War on terror
	•	the ‘war on terror’ is not a total war and therefore domestic engagement in the conflict takes on a completely different character. (Rasmussen, 2004)
	•	The War on Terror which George Bush declared shortly after 9/11 has produced what social scientists call a new paradigm, and like all paradigms it is self-validating because it supplies the criteria that warrant its own legitimization. (Coker, 2009)
	•	It taps into a deep concern about the vulnerabilities of the modern world. (Coker, 2009)
	•	In the War on Terror, adds military historian Roger Spiller, ‘victory [has become] an outmoded concept’ (Spiller 2005:356). (Coker, 2009)
	•	In the case of the War on Terror the US has come up with a series of indices for judging success or failure. Are we tackling the root causes of terrorism? Are we winning the hearts and minds? Are we encouraging terrorists to defect from terrorist movements? Are we raising difficulties in recruitment? Are we cutting off financial funds? Are we ending state-support? Are we decreasing the military effectiveness of terrorist groups? (Coker, 2009)
	•	A central theme of the War on Terror, though it is rarely stated publicly, is that in an age of risk victory is no longer possible: all that can be pursued is the more effective manage- ment of the global disorder that obtains. Success now means reducing insecurity to more acceptable levels. (Coker, 2009)

Warning
	•	The act of giving actual warning is based on the certainty that arises from deduction: it relies on the detection of adversary preparations (the ‘case’), and the knowledge of the ‘rules’ that would determine whether and how these preparations would lead to an impending conflict (in the case of tactical warning), or increase a strategic risk (in the case of strategic warning). (Frühling, 2014)
	•	Tactical and strategic warning are so important because they can make it possible to ‘discount’ future requirements, in the sensethat less military capability is required to be available on a continuous basis if it can be increased in time to meet a risk that is found to be materializing or increasing. (Frühling, 2014)
	•	Tactical and strategic warning both reduce the extent to which specific provisions have to be made to deal with undetected or unexpected changes in strategic risks. (Frühling, 2014)
	•	Warnings are seldom perfect and failure is rarely complete. (Betts, 2007)
	•	there can be cases when the quality of the intelligence warning depends as much on the analysts’ ability to understand the actions of their own government than that of the potential opponent. (Omand, 2014)
	•	Normally the warning function will be concerned with threatening futures, but even perhaps on a few occasions a set of opportunities. (Omand, 2014)
	•	Ambassador Wolfowitz characterizes warning as first cousin to bad news. A properly executed warning is a serious matter because it requires rethinking of policy, including possible redeployment of resources and the undertaking of risky as well as costly action. (Davis, 1996)
	•	Warning must lobby for attention. This does not work through anonymous, routine warning reports. A one-page written brief would help get the needed attention; a special briefing would also help. (Davis, 1996)
	•	Warning is not just sensors and hardware; it is also analysis. (Hopple, 1984)
	•	Warning occurs in a policy context, which depends on politics. (Byman, 2005)
Strategic warning
	•	Both tactical and strategic warning ultimately rest on a combination of abductive and deductive reasoning. (Frühling, 2014)
	•	a long-term intention to attack, given well in advance. (Honig, 2007)
	•	preventing surprise attacks depends largely on the ability of analysts and policymakers to understand and connect the available signals and warnings. (Dahl, 2013)
	•	But warnings about possible surprise attacks usually occur at either the strategic or tactical level, and the two terms are usually defined this way. (Dahl, 2013)
	•	Strategic warning: Warns of threats from six months to several years out.(Marrin, 2002)
	•	Strategic warning intelligence involves tracking indicators, evaluating the threat or concern to the United States, and then quickly communicating warning of impending threats to decisionmakers. The necessity of conveying information in a timely manner prevents competitive analysis from being applicable to warning intelligence. (Stack, 1997)

Tactical warning
	•	‘Tactical warning’ relates to the prediction of events, when a risk materializes and becomes a certainty. (Frühling, 2014)
	•	Preparations for tactical warning therefore must be focused on the realization of a particular, defined strategic risk, known and prioritized in advance. (Frühling, 2014)
	•	Both tactical and strategic warning ultimately rest on a combination of abductive and deductive reasoning. (Frühling, 2014)
	•	a short-term warning of the enemy’s immediate plan to attack. (Honig, 2007)
	•	I term tactical warning specific enough to allow the security authorities to counter an actual threat. This is ultimately the most valuable intelligence to have, but also the hardest to obtain. (Omand, 2014)
	•	Tactical warning: Indicates an attack may come within hours or days. (Marrin, 2002)

Warning indicator
	•	The definition of warning indicators, however, rests on abductive reasoning. (Frühling, 2014)
	•	The classic application of indicators is to seek early warning of some undesirable event such as a military attack or a possible nuclear test by a foreign country. (Pherson, 2009)
Warming time
	•	Warning time is the time that elapses between the decision to react, and the moment of greatest danger (or outbreak of hostilities), and is the time that is actually available to materially increase the strength of the defending side. (Frühling, 2014)
	•	Estimates of lead and warning times are thus largely determined by the understanding of the strategic environment, propensity of adversaries to use deception, the quality of information about the adversary and the decisiveness of political decision-makers. (Frühling, 2014)

Warning fatigue
	•	Warning fatigue will dull senses. (Omand, 2014)
	•	The only sound advice to give is to educate government, the media and the public to come to see tac- tical warning as an exercise in risk management. (Omand, 2014)
	•	there is no absolute level of safety that can be offered to the public. (Omand, 2014)

Factual–Technical Warning
	•	Factual–Technical Warning involves detecting a certain tangible threat and delivering the information. The main crux is the collection of observable or audible data. This is usually concrete and reliable data about the timing or location of an attack where the intent is clear, like during an ongoing war. The analyst’s job is simply to deliver the threatening information. (Honig, 2007)

Contingent-Political Warning
	•	In this situation the military indicators are largely unhelpful and the analysts are compelled to base their prediction on their estimate of the enemy’s intentions, either because no prior military buildup (i.e., a sudden attack by fast moving forces) occurs, or because the international tensions provide a full explanation for the military buildup (e.g., a crisis). (Honig, 2007)
Operational warning
	•	operational warning in which government is made aware of the nature of specific threats and opportunities (in practice more of the former, alas, than the latter) with some sense of timeline to enable urgency to be calibrated. (Omand, 2014)
	•	operational alerting can be issued that will trigger precautionary deployments or contingency planning, or even allow the putting into effect of previous contingency plans com- missioned on the basis of operational warning. A simple example from the field of terrorism would be the identification of a new type of attack mode following terrorist attacks overseas (for example the Mumbai attacks of 2008) leading to operational alerts being issued to the operators of the critical national infrastructure, triggering adjustments to programmes of protection and hardening for key facilities, in advance of any specific intelligence of an identified group actually planning such an attack. (Omand, 2014)
	•	Operational warning: Indicates threats within several weeks or months. (Marrin, 2002)

Early warning
	•	Early warning in strategic intelligence studies can be defined as ‘Informing decisions makers about the enemy’s future actions, in a time span ensuring the possibility of taking of steps previously evaluated as adequate to neutralize advantages that the enemy may obtain from surprise, and thereby frustrating the surprise move. (Kahana, 2002)
	•	Such warnings would be provided on the basis of methods of collecting information about war preparations. (Kahana, 2002)
	•	He observed that ‘likelihood’ was a dynamic concept and was contingent upon specific developments. (Kahana, 2002)
	•	from then until the outbreak of the Yom Kippur War the sense of early warning apparently altered, to refer to the enemy’s intentions. (Kahana, 2002)
	•	An early warning might always be a false warning, and if the situation indeed deteriorates, it might be due to unnecessary mobilization on the part of the side that got early warning, which thereby escalates the war unintentionally. (Kahana, 2002)
	•	there is a complex chain of events involved in the provision of early warning. (Omand, 2014)

Paradox of warning
	•	As Mary McCarthy writes, ‘‘Most successful warnings appear to be false alarms,’’ because the warning gets to policymakers in time for them to take action to deter the threat. (Dahl, 2013)
	•	Perfecting intelligence production does not necessarily lead to per- fecting consumption. Making warning systems more sensitive reduces the risk of surprise but increases the number of false alarms, thereby reducing sensitivity. (Betts, 2007)
	•	ambiguity can also be aggravated by an excess of data. (Betts, 2007)
	•	Paradoxically, sometimes the more one knows about a subject, the worse one’s judgment of it. Knowledge can become an innocent enemy of intelligence. (Betts, 2007)
	•	Normal theory is indispensable because it usually produces the right conclusion. (Betts, 2007)
Normal theory
	•	The first task—projecting developments over time—must emphasize probabilistic thinking and making the best possible estimates about behavior in numerous incidents of international competition. It puts a premium on those powerful theories that account for typical enemy action—those that explain behavior in the largest percentage of cases. (Betts, 2007)
	•	normal theory derives its power from categorical simplifications and parsimony. (Betts, 2007)
	•	A process that injects some form of exceptional thinking—for example, applying contrary hypotheses and reasoning backward from the improbable outcome to make the case for how it could happen—might mitigate the risks in relying on probabilities based on long experience. (Betts, 2007)
	•	A nonspecialist, by virtue of his comparative ignorance of all the powerful reasons to bet on continuity, is more susceptible to exceptional thinking. The expert knows the adversary’s character—sometimes too well. The non- expert may naively view the enemy as a generic chess player or as a mirror image of our own way of thinking—views that normally prompt misunderstanding but are more open to the possibility that a normally predictable enemy will act out of character. (Betts, 2007)
	•	Normal theory is the most important way to deal with intelligence on a daily basis. (Betts, 2007)
	•	Normal theory should be challenged periodically, in the same way that academic theories are challenged in the play of revisionism and debate in journals. (Betts, 2007)
Overwarning
	•	Overwarning is another problem. Intelligence assessments often overreact to previous errors that underestimated a threat but do not correct sufficiently when a threat is overestimated (Report of a Committee of Privy Counsellors 2004, p. 112, para. 456). The intelligence community may cry wolf so often that policy makers become inured to the danger and dismiss reports of a looming crisis (Betts 1978). (Byman, 2005)
Terrorist warning
	•	The warning problem of terrorism is exceptionally difficult, compounding the challenges that individual analysts, bureaucracies, and policy makers face with regard to strategic surprise. (Byman, 2005)
Warning system
	•	a warning problem as a clear and concise statement of a potential or existing threat, risk or concern to national or NATO interests. (Omand, 2014)
Way of life
	•	defined as a 'combination of social relations and cultural bias'. (Boholm, 1996)
	•	The link between cultural bias and social relations constitutes a 'way of life'. (Boholm, 1996)
	•	a way of life is understood as a predetermined combination of particular values and beliefs, on the one hand, and particular social relationships between people, on the other. (Boholm, 1996)
	•	Because of their common 'way of life', individuals' tastes, moral preferences, con- sumer habits, attitudes towards government, and their ideas about nature will be molded so that idiosyncrasies are levelled and everyone comes to share with their fellows a standardized package of existence (Douglas 1996). (Boholm, 1996)
	•	Way oflife corresponds in a one-to-one relationship, not to individuals, but to 'social contexts'. (Boholm, 1996)
	•	La vie sociale est, par eux, en effet, considérablement influencée à divers niveaux qui vont de la mode vestimentaire et musicale à la détermination des attitudes regardant les relations familiales, le mariage, et de celles qui régissent les options politiques. Non seulement la télévision et la presse influent sur la silhouette des femmes, leur coiffure et leur maquillage, mais elles déterminent également leur manière d’être dans l’existence de tous les jours, fixent leurs choix concernant les partenaires amoureux, les enfants, les objets de consommation. Les infiltrations subconscientes des images télévisées notamment donnent à celles-ci la force de modèles agissant dans le sens de la prescription d'une véritable way of life. (Mannoni, 1985)
	•	hommes et les femmes qui constituent le public sont confrontés à un modèle auquel ils sont préssés de se conformer. (Mannoni, 1985)
Wave
	•	In reality, waves rolling up the beach are not precisely identical, but in some circumstances they come close: for example, gentle ripples on a very calm sea. Simple mathematical equations for waves reproduce this pattern: they have regular periodic solutions. (Stewart, 2013)
Weakness
	•	earlier, people often try to cover up their weaknesses by presenting them as something positive. We see them brimming with Self-confidence, only to later discover that they are actually arrogant and incapable of listening. They seem frank and sincere, but over time we realize that they are actually boorish and unable to consider the feelings of others. Or they seem prudent and thoughtful, but eventually we see that they are in fact timid at their core and afraid of the slightest criticism. People can be quite adept at creating these optical illusions, and we fall for them. Similarly, people will charm and flatter us and, blinded by our desire to like them, we fail to look deeper and see the character flaws. (Greene, 2018)
	•	For each weakness there is a corresponding strength. (Greene, 2018)
Weakness priviledge
	•	un seul homme a toujours le droit d'en insulter cinquante : c'est le privilège de la faiblesse. Seulement il a tort d'user de ce droit. Croyez-moi, général, jurez et ne nous insultez pas. (Dumas, 1998)
Weather forcasting
	•	Climate modelling differs fundamentally from weather forecasting. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
Web-behaviour analysis
	•	[…] used material publically available on the web to trace the development of amplification of concerns about the project. (Breakwell, 2014)
	•	It is possible to monitor, in real time, the impact of new postings on the web upon the traffic and content of other actors in cyber space. (Breakwell, 2014)
	•	Web-behaviour analysis introduces for SARF theorists a whole new capacity for modelling amplification and attenuation. (Breakwell, 2014)
What You See is All There is (Wysiati) 
	•	WYSIATI facilitates the achievement of coherence and of the cognitive ease that causes us to accept a statement as true. It explains why we can think fast, and how we are able to make sense of partial information in a complex world. Much of the time, the coherent story we put together is close enough to reality to support reasonable action. (Kahneman, 2012)
Wheel
	•	The wheel has circular symmetry: every point on the rim is the same distance from the centre. So it can roll along the flat surface, and the centre always stays at the same height. (Stewart, 2013)
White male effect
	•	white males are different from everyone else in their perceptions and attitudes toward risk. (Finucane et al., 2000)
	•	White males may perceive less risk than others because they are more involved in creating, managing, controlling and benefiting from technology. (Finucane et al., 2000)
	•	high-risk responses were lower for white males on every item. (Finucane et al., 2000)
	•	white males differed from others in their ratings of perceived risks to individuals and the public. (Finucane et al., 2000)
	•	White males displayed more hierarchical and individualistic views and less fatalistic and egalitarian views. (Finucane et al., 2000)
	•	Almost every study of risk perception has found that men seem to be less concerned about hazards than are women. (Slovic, 2000)
	•	differences in worldviews, trust, control and other sociopolitical factors could be key determinants of gender and race differences in risk judgments, and that risk perceptions may reflect deep-seated values about technology and its impact on society. (Slovic, 2000)
	•	risk perceptions seem to be related to individuals’ power to influence decisions about the use of hazards. (Slovic, 2000)
	•	The ‘white male’ effect was first described by Flynn et al. (1994) on the basis of results of a national survey of perceptions of risks to the public of 25 environmental hazards. Although a number of studies have shown that males tend to perceive risks to be lower than females, and that whites perceive risks to be lower than non-whites (Vaughan and Nordenstam 1991; Slovic 1992; Savage 1993; Spigner et al. 1993; Hughes et al. 1996; Bord and O’Connor 1997; Burger et al. 1999; Palmer et al. 2001), Flynn et al. (1994) noticed that the proportion of white males providing a high-risk response was always smaller than all others in the sample for each of the 25 hazards. (Palmer, 2003)
	•	white males tend to perceive health and technology hazards as having low risk because their worldview is one of trust in institutions and authorities. (Palmer, 2003)
	•	White males also were more likely to endorse hierarchist and individualist attitudes and less likely to endorse fatalist and egalitarian attitudes than the remainder of the sample. (Palmer, 2003)
	•	[…]is a pervasive phenomenon that affects risk judgements pertaining to society as well as the individual. (Palmer, 2003)
	•	the ‘white male’ effect may not be limited to white males. (Palmer, 2003)
	•	the explanation for the white male’ effect lies in sociopolitical factors. (Palmer, 2003)
	•	the ‘white male’ effect has only been evaluated in the context of health and technology hazards. (Palmer, 2003)
	•	White males also were more likely to endorse individualist attitudes and less likely to endorse egalitarian attitudes than the rest of the sample, a finding that is consistent with previous studies of the ‘white male’ effect (Flynn et al. 1994; Finucane et al. 2000b). (Palmer, 2003)
	•	the term ‘white’ is a political term used for political purposes. (Palmer, 2003)
	•	treating ‘white males’ as a group consistently has revealed their tendency to perceive the risks of health and technology hazards as low. (Palmer, 2003)
	•	there is some heterogeneity of risk perceptions among white males. (Palmer, 2003)
	•	white males stood out from everyone else (female and non-white male) in their perceptions and attitudes regarding risk. (Bickerstaff, 2004)
	•	They rule out the influence of biology and like Boholm surmise that these differences emerged because of power differentials: those with more power and greatest socioeco- nomic advantage (white men) are less likely to see the world as dangerous than are others. (Bickerstaff, 2004)
	•	White male leads to lower risk perceptions and greater willingness to accept risks. (Brent K., 2004)
	•	White males perceive risks to be less threatening than wo- men and non-White males. (Brent K., 2004).
	•	The ‘‘White male’’ hypothesis implies that there is something unique about being a White male in the United States that leads to lower risk perceptions and greater willingness to accept risks. (Brent K., 2004)
	•	The authors find that White males are significantly more accepting than women and non-Wite males of specific risks associated with 20 of the 25 hazards included in the survey (Flynn et al. 1994). (Brent K., 2004)
	•	The obvious question is why are White males so accepting of risk. (Brent K., 2004)
	•	The risk- accepting White males had higher levels of socioeconomic status and were more politically conservative compared to the risk adverse White males and the rest of the sample (Flynn et al. 1994; Slovic 2000b). (Brent K., 2004)
	•	A study comparing risk perceptions of men and women found that men, especially white males, perceive risks to be lower than women and non-white men (Finucane et al., 2000). (Nicholson et al., 2005)
	•	the "white- male effect" turned out to be highly culture specific. The difference between the mean risk perceptions of white men and those of white females and minorities was pronounced among persons subscribing to hierarchical worldviews and individualistic worldviews for every one of the risks examined. (Kahan et al., 2007) 
	•	Prior research focusing on risk perceptions has led to the observation that well-educated and politically conservative white males tend to systematically perceive lower levels of risk from a wide range of hazards when compared to other members of society (e.g., white women, nonwhite women and men). (Rivers et al., 2010)
	•	The “white male effect” (WME) refers to a segment of the population—white males, as the name implies—who perceive a wide range of risks is as being significantly lower (Fig. 1) when compared with white women, as well as both genders from other ethnic groups. (Rivers et al., 2010)
	•	the subset of men defined by the WME are character- ized by several distinguishing factors that contrast them with other demographic groups: they gener- ally possess a higher-than-average level of education and household income, are politically conservative, display hierarchal and individualistic worldviews, are more supportive of technological advances, and tend to place greater trust in authority figures, such as in- dustry and government officials. (Rivers et al., 2010)
	•	these studies of the WME acknowledge the many factors that set white males apart from other groups. (Rivers et al., 2010) 
	•	We draw upon a recent theoretical argument in the risk perception literature— the identity-protective cognition thesis (Kahan et al., 2007)— that explains the ‘‘white male’’ effect, or the atypically high levels of technological and environmental risk acceptance among white males. (McCright and Dunlap, 2011)
	•	white males are found to be more accepting of a wide range of risks than are other adults. (McCright and Dunlap, 2011)
	•	the white male effect has been found with respect to perceptions of technological risks (Finucane et al., 2000; Flynn et al., 1994; Palmer, 2003; Satterfield et al., 2004), environmental problems (Finucane et al., 2000; Flynn et al., 1994; Johnson, 2002; Kahan et al., 2007; Kalof et al., 2002; Marshall, 2004; Marshall et al., 2006; Satterfield et al., 2004), and public health threats (Finucane et al., 2000; Flynn et al., 1994; Palmer, 2003). (McCright and Dunlap, 2011)
	•	the white male effect appears to be quite robust. (McCright and Dunlap, 2011)
	•	Previous research has shown that white males have a relatively low perception of risks, known as the ‘white male effect’ (WME). (Olofsson and Rashid, 2011)
	•	Many of the explanations of this effect refer to the privileged position of this particular demographic group in society, adducing white males’ socio-economic resources, sense of control, worldviews etc. (Olofsson and Rashid, 2011)
	•	Equality therefore seems to be a fruitful concept with which to examine differences in risk perception between groups in society, and we propose that the ‘societal inequality effect’ is a more proper description than the ‘white male effect’. (Olofsson and Rashid, 2011)
	•	Previous studies have shown that it is not all white males that rate risk to be low, but rather a subset of well-educated, politically conservative men noted for their hierarchical and individualistic world-views. (Olofsson and Rashid, 2011)
	•	white males have individualistic and hierarchical world-views. (Olofsson and Rashid, 2011) 
	•	white males tended to differ from everyone else in their attitudes and perceptions---on average, they perceived risks as much smaller and much more acceptable than did other people. (Flynn et al., 1994)
	•	[…] suggest that socio-political factors such as power, status, alienation, and trust are strong determiners of people’s perception and acceptance of risks. (Flynn et al., 1994)
	•	White males were always less likely to rate a hazard as posing a “high risk.” (Flynn et al., 1994)
	•	The phenomenon known as the white male effect (WME) stipulates that white males differ in their perceptions of risk compared to women and ethnic minorities; white males tend to judge risk lower, particularly compared to women from ethnic minorities. (Olofsson and Rashid, 2011)
	•	The WME hypothesis was first formulated and empirically tested in the US, and to date the vast majority of investigations are of American origin. (Olofsson and Rashid, 2011)
	•	The role of culturally attached world-views as well as differences in societal stratification – the power balance between the sexes and ethnic groups – can thus shed light on the mechanisms that influence the existence of the WME. (Olofsson and Rashid, 2011)
	•	Different factors have been used to explain the WME, from socio-economic characteristics to worldviews and vulnerability. (Olofsson and Rashid, 2011)
	•	socioeconomic factors are important in explaining the effect. (Olofsson and Rashid, 2011)
	•	white males  have  a  weaker  risk  perception  of  health  andtechnology  hazards  compared  to  white  females  orpeople  of  color. (Figuié and Fournier, 2008)

White paper
	•	[…] White Papers have been recognized as important means for transparency, as they are a suitable means to make coherent statemetns that illustrate the link between perceptions of strategic risks, strategy, capability requirements and force structures. (Frühling, 2014)
	•	[…] White Paper that such documents are ‘valuable because they can increase the transparency of defence policymaking in ways that can jelp to build trust between nations’. (Frühling, 2014)
	•	As part of a 1996 working group of the Council for Security Cooperation in the Asia Pacific, Kang Choi argued for standardized approaches to the drafting and evaluation of White Papers. He writes that:We can set up at least five criteria to evaluate a defense white paper: comprehensiveness of contents, balance and mutual supportiveness among different categories, precision and reliable information, consistency and standardization, and availability. There are various areas in national defense: threat assessment, military requirements, resource allocation, military establishment, maintenance and operation, use of force, and evaluation…. [The White Paper’s] contents should be well balanced, logically consistent and mutually supportive. If it deals with certain areas in detail while skipping others, or exaggerates minor issues, it will loose harmony and balance and will not serve as an integrated system of information. (Frühling, 2014)
	•	codification is essential for the overall implementation of strategic guidance. It is in its codified form that a strategy links the decisions resulting from detailed programming to the original intent and toavailable resources. (Frühling, 2014)
	•	Codification usually results in idiosyncratic planning concepts and categories that are based on the specific pattern of strategic risk, the strategy, and the influence of geography and other factors as they apply at a particular time. (Frühling, 2014)
	•	One of the core tasks of White Papers and reviews is to provide this translation of the political leadership’s priorities and directed strategy, into the codified form that can be used to inform resource allocation decisions by the bureaucracy. (Frühling, 2014)
	•	publication of defense white papers (or “defense policy papers”) is a voluntary and unilateral measure. They can contain very comprehensive information regarding various fields of each state’s defense policy; they can also be a vehicle for communication between government and its respective domestic audience, as well as between states. (Choi, 1996)
	•	their publication can be regarded as an initial preliminary step to build confidence and trust between states. (Choi, 1996)
	•	defense white papers differ from one country to another, as do type, scope, and level of information. Sometimes a current version differs from the previous ones, and there are many longitudinal or cross-sectional variations or both. Of course, all these variables-publicational, form, contents, cycle, and type, scope and level of information-are determined by each nation. (Choi, 1996)
	•	A defense white paper is the authoritative, open, publicly available, and highly specialized official document (or report) prepared for and published by a country’s ministry or department of defense. (Choi, 1996)
	•	It provides not only a review of defense issues of the past and present but also the blueprint and vision for various defense fields for the future. (Choi, 1996)
	•	A defense white paper, the most authoritative government document concerning defense, is a distinctive way of expressing and delivering the government’s perception and assessment of its security environment, its will and its capability to accomplish national security objectives and goals, and strategies to react to perceived threats to national security. (Choi, 1996)
	•	It clearly identifies areas of concern, illustrates capabilities available today and tomorrow, and sets a course or courses of action it will take. (Choi, 1996)
	•	A defense white paper does not intend to achieve complete transparency, which may undermine a country’s defense or deterrence posture by revealing too much information. (Choi, 1996)
	•	The scope and level of information provided by a defense white paper are likely to be determined by thegovernment’s decision to strike a balance between secrecy and transpar- ency. (Choi, 1996)
	•	By making the will and capabilities of a country transparent to a certain degree, a defense white paper contributes to deterrence and reassurance. (Choi, 1996)
	•	It works to promote correct understanding and expectations, and to prevent misjudgment and suspicion by minimizing the chance of information distortion and bias. (Choi, 1996)
	•	Information distortion and bias can arise if there is little information available and if there is too much secrecy in the defense field. (Choi, 1996)
	•	By making defense-related informa- tion publicly available, the defense white paper will prevent unwarranted suspicion and misjudgement. (Choi, 1996)
	•	while it cannot fully eliminate chances of misinterpretation, it can reduce the degree of groundless suspicion and misjudgment. (Choi, 1996)
	•	A defense white paper performs a function of communication between the government and the domestic audience, and between states. It helps to mobilize and secure domestic as well as international support for defense policies of the publishing country by making defense-related information to some degree publicly available, or transparent. (Choi, 1996)
	•	Since governments presumably listen to and take into account the responses from their audience before and after the publication and distribution of a defense white paper, it provides a channel of communication, or “open window,” between the government and its audience. (Choi, 1996)
	•	A defense white paper is also likely to enhance the chance of policy coordination and cooperation between states externally, and between government agencies internally. (Choi, 1996)
	•	Internally, a defense white paper can promote debates and consensus on resource allocation and policy priorities. (Choi, 1996)
	•	a defense white paper can be viewed as guidance to a country’s subordinate service branches concerning national security objectives. Based upon these objectives and the general defense policy lines it provides, each service branch must identify its own areas of mission and concerns, and formulate and carry out its policies. (Choi, 1996)
	•	We have identified five functions of a defense white paper: deterrence and prevention, promotion of common correct understanding and judgement, channel of communication, inter-governmental and intra-governmental policy coordination and cooperation, and policy guidance to service branches; this is not an exclusive list, but these first four functions are important in promoting security cooperation among states. (Choi, 1996)
	•	We can set up at least five criteria to evaluate a defense white paper: comprehensiveness of contents, balance and mutual supportiveness among different categories, precision and reliable information, consistency and standardization, and availability. (Choi, 1996)
	•	In order to provide a clear understanding of a nation’s defense policy, a defense white paper should cover all relevant areas of national defense. Intentional or unintentional omission of a certain part or parts of defense policy is likely to increase suspicion and reduce the trustworthiness of the document. (Choi, 1996)
	•	A defense white paper should be a comprehensive, internationally circulated value-laden information source, and its contents should be well balanced, logically consistent and mutually supportive. If it deals with certain areas in detail while skipping others, or exaggerates minor issues, it will loose harmony and balance and will not serve as an integrated system of information. It can become too subjective or full of euphemistic wishful thinking. (Choi, 1996)
	•	Information contained in a defense white paper must be precise and reliable. (Choi, 1996)
	•	A defense white paper should be available to anyone who wants it; if access is limited it becomes a semi-classified document. (Choi, 1996)
	•	five criteria to evaluate a defense white paper: comprehensiveness, balance and harmony, preciseness and reliability, consistency and standardization, and availability. (Choi, 1996)
	•	There are three major areas: perception, will, and capabilities. Further dividing these three yields at least six parts or chapters: threat assess- ment (or assessment of the security environment); national security objectives and goals; current defense posture; defense requirements and initiatives; defense management; and overall evaluation. (Choi, 1996)
	•	The number of countries that publish a defense white paper is increasing, which is a quite positive sign. (Choi, 1996)
	•	if we have a common form of defense white paper and if we are able to institutionalize it, it should help us reduce suspicion, build trust and promote cooperation by enhancing mutual transparency. (Choi, 1996)
	•	Publication of a defense white paper is a voluntary measure. No one can force others to publish one, or to use certain forms or outlines. Thus there should be consensus on the functions and the merit of a defense- white-paper open window. (Choi, 1996)
	•	Some defense white papers have reached a very high level of standardization and sophistication and have become fixed, whereas some are still changing and/or are under development. (Choi, 1996)
	•	Publication of a defense white paper is a unilateral and voluntary measure, and no one can force those who do not want to participate. (Choi, 1996)
	•	At the beginning, it would be desirable to emphasize comprehen- siveness and availability. A common defense white paper should be comprehensive enough to cover most areas of defense policy: perception, orientation, and capability. (Choi, 1996)
	•	a defense white paper should be a tool of communication. (Choi, 1996)
	•	Based on the exchanges of views, ideas, perceptions, and understanding of each nation’s defense policy through onr common defense white paper, we may be able to extract more precise and reliable information and data since we shall have built a certain level of mutual confidence and trust. (Choi, 1996)
	•	A defense white paper is one of various transparency measures. It is not a cure-all, but it It is one very elementary step we can take. (Choi, 1996)
	•	the primary audience of a defense white paper is domestic, so it is not an easy task for any country to change its current format, contents, and scope and level of information of defense white paper to meet a common format. (Choi, 1996)
	•	[…] defense white paper is a readibly available and comparable source of official defence information. (Kiselycznyk et al., 2010)
	•	White papers are authoritative and publicly available documents that constitute o cial statements about a country’s defense policies, goals, and capabilities. (Kiselycznyk et al., 2010)
	•	It is no coincidence that ‘national security strategies’ were published in the years after 9/11 in Washington, Paris, Berlin, London, The Hague, Canberra, Singapore and elsewhere. On the one hand, governments have recognized their responsibility for providing a sense of security to their publics in the face of such dangers as terrorism and proliferation. (Omand, 2014)
Wicked problem
	•	As a wicked problem, war is resistant to traditional military thinking. (Coker, 2009)
	•	A wicked problem, in addition, cannot even be understood until a solution has been formulated, and formulations will differ because we cannot realize goals so much as seek them. (Coker, 2009)
	•	In a wicked problem the situation on the ground is never stable, which is why the definition of the problem may change as the situation evolves. (Coker, 2009)
	•	In that sense, what makes a problem ‘wicked’ is that it can never be ‘solved’, only managed until someone finally decides to stop managing it, or the man- agers run out of resources, time or money. (Coker, 2009)
	•	in managing wicked problems the most important challenge is one that is central to an age of risk: consequence management. (Coker, 2009)
	•	‘Because of social complexity solving a wicked problem is fundamentally a social process’ (Australian Government 2007:28). It is a socialization process involving col- lective learning through shared experiences; the problem is that none of this is happening either in the ISAF HQ or in the field. (Coker, 2009)
	•	Wicked problems are ‘solved’ when the managers persuade the local actors to behave differently, but that also requires them to behave differently themselves. (Coker, 2009) 
	•	In the end, wicked problems highlight the seminal importance of the local: tame problems can often be tackled from the centre; wicked problems rarely can. (Coker, 2009)
	•	Wicked problems are always changing, and those on the ground have to be able to adapt quickly, and to process information about the changing situation faster than ever before. (Coker, 2009)
	•	Wicked problems are a useful way of thinking about one’s objectives in a risk age. (Coker, 2009)
Wife
	•	Or, puisqu'on ne peut faire de ce rêve une réalité ; comme pour arriver à un certain but il faut que Mlle Danglars devienne ma femme, c'est-à-dire qu'elle vive avec moi, qu'elle pense près de moi, qu'elle chante près de moi, qu'elle fasse des vers et de la musique à dix pas de moi, et cela pendant tout le temps de ma vie, alors je m'épouvante. (Dumas, 1998)
Wikipedia
	•	Wikipedia, a growing resource written and edited for the masses by the masses (or at least some of the masses – more than 50,000 contributors at last count) (Stilgoe et al., 2006)
	•	Resources such as Wikipedia provide an entry point into an otherwise impenetrable body of knowledge (Stilgoe et al., 2006)

Willingness to accept 
	•	WTA is normally equal to the costs of supplying the goods (Torriti and Ikpeb, 2014)
Willpower
	•	The mind and the body are one, and your thoughts affect your physical responses. People can recover much more quickly from illness through sheer desire and willpower.  (Greene, 2018)
	•	Do not be afraid to exaggerate the role of willpower. It is an exaggeration with a purpose. It leads to a positive self-fulfilling dynamic, and that is all you care about. See this shaping of your attitude as your most important creation in life, and never leave it to chance. (Greene, 2018)
	•	we must recognize the role that willpower plays in our health. (Greene, 2018)
Winning
	•	Winning gives the victor an existential satisfaction. (Coker, 2009)
	•	We play to win and we generally derive most pleasure not from playing but winning.  (Coker, 2009)
Words
	•	The brain responds quickly even to purely symbolic threats. Emotionally loaded words quickly attract attention, and bad words (war, crime) attract attention faster than do happy words (peace, love) (Kahneman, 2012)
	•	Words are often used as a cover-up, a way to conceal what is really going on. (Greene, 2018)
	•	Words express direct information. We can argue about what people mean when they say something, but the interpretations are fairly limited. (Greene, 2018)
	•	When you use people’s words back at them, it has a hypnotic effect. How can they not follow what you suggest when it is exactly the words they have used? (Greene, 2018)
	•	Words are held to have meaning in the synchronic system and in their relationships with other words, not in their diachronic link to one of the languages of the past: 'the meaning is always now'. (Hutton, 1998)
	•	J'ai toujours eu plus peur d'une plume, d'une bouteille d'encre et d'une feuille de papier que d'une épée ou d'un pistolet. (Dumas, 1998)
	•	The network of words changes as speakers change, and as the overall language evolves, introducing neologisms and new semantic relations. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
	•	La puissance des mots est liée aux images qu'ils évoquent et est indépendante de leur sens réel.—Ces images varient d'âge en âge, de race en race. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	En étudiant l'imagination des foules, nous avons vu qu'elle est impressionnée surtout par des images. Ces images, on n'en dispose pas toujours, mais il est possible de les évoquer par l'emploi judicieux des mots et des formules. Maniés avec art, ils possèdent vraiment la puissance mystérieuse que leur attribuaient jadis les adeptes de la magie. Ils font naître dans l'âme des foules les plus formidables tempêtes, et savent aussi les calmer. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	La puissance des mots est liée aux images qu'ils évoquent et tout à fait indépendante de leur signification réelle. Ce sont parfois ceux dont le sens est le plus mal défini qui possèdent le plus d'action. Tels par exemple, les termes: démocratie, socialisme, égalité, liberté, etc., dont le sens est si vague que de gros volumes ne suffisent pas à le préciser. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Ils synthétisent les aspirations inconscientes les plus diverses et l'espoir de leur réalisation.  (Lebon, 1895)
	•	La raison et les arguments ne sauraient lutter contre certains mots et certaines formules. On les prononce avec recueillement devant les foules; et, dès qu'ils ont été prononcés, les visages deviennent respectueux et les fronts s'inclinent. Beaucoup les considèrent comme des forces de la nature, des puissances surnaturelles. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Les images évoquées par les mots étant indépendantes de leur sens, varient d'âge en âge, de peuple à peuple, sous l'identité des formules. À certains mots s'attachent transitoirement certaines images: le mot n'est que le bouton d'appel qui les fait apparaître. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Si l'on considère une langue déterminée, on voit que les mots dont elle se compose changent assez lentement dans le cours des âges; (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Que faisons-nous, en réalité, quand nous substituons un terme français à un terme latin, grec ou sanscrit, ou même quand nous cherchons à comprendre un livre écrit dans notre propre langue il y a deux ou trois siècles? Nous substituons simplement les images et les idées que la vie moderne a mises dans notre intelligence, aux notions et aux images absolument différentes que la vie ancienne avait fait naître dans l'âme de races soumises à des conditions d'existence sans analogie avec les nôtres. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	Les mots n'ont donc que des significations mobiles et transitoires, changeantes d'âge en âge et de peuple à peuple; et, quand nous voulons agir par eux, sur la foule, ce qu'il faut savoir, c'est le sens qu'ils ont pour elle à un moment donné, et non celui qu'ils eurent jadis ou qu'ils peuvent avoir pour des individus de constitution mentale différente. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	La puissance des mots est si grande qu'il suffit de désigner par des termes bien choisis les choses les plus odieuses pour les faire accepter des foules. (Lebon, 1895)
	•	puissance spéciale des mots et des formules. Il faut les choisir de façon à ce qu'ils évoquent des images très vives. (Lebon, 1895)
Word co-occurrence
	•	In general, context provides the exact meaning of words: the co-occurrence of words in sentences defines their meaning. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
Word network
	•	We can now create our own maps of language. We use words as vertices and the edges connect synonyms, antonyms, and polysemic words (these relations can be drawn from a thesasurus or a dictionary, while patterns of co-occurrence can be drawn from large language databases, such as the British National Corpus). Semantic connections are more difficult to pin down: their study forms a complete area of linguistics. Some languages have special dictionaries that associate one word with a set of related ones. An alternative approach is experimental word association. A word is provided to a sample of people, asking them to say the first word that comes into their mind after hearing it. The resulting words are then used to repeat the association experiment. Proceeding in this way, step by step we build our web of associations. Different instances of word networks display different results. These depend on the language, on the kind of text, on the education of the author of the text, or may be related to linguistic dysfunctions.  (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
	•	Word networks contain a lot of information, but usually they are not particularly useful in studying the actual content of the texts and the relations between the ideas expressed in different texts. This is a crucial issue for web queries, for example. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
World
	•	the world is not linear. (Smith and Smith, 2007)
Small-world property 
	•	The small-world property consists of the fact that the average distance between any two nodes (measured as the shortest path that connects them) is very small. Given a node in a network (say, Paul Erdős in the co-authorship network), few nodes are very close to it (direct co-authors) and few are far from it (scientists with very high Erdős numbers): the majority are at the average—and very short—distance. This holds for all networks: starting from one specific node, almost all the nodes are at very few steps from it; the number of nodes within a certain distance increases exponentially fast with the distance. Another way of explaining the same phenomenon (the way scientists usually spell it out) is the following: even if we add many nodes to a network, the average distance will not increase much; one has to increase the size of a network by several orders of magnitude to notice that the paths to new nodes are (just a little) longer. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
	•	The small-world property is crucial to many network phenomena. The short synaptic distance in the neocortex may be crucial to its functioning: some studies suggest that neurodegenerative illnesses such as Alzheimer’s imply a massive loss of the small-world property in the brain. Short distances in the sexual relations networks suggest that the concept of risk group in sexually transmitted diseases has to be interpreted carefully: virtually everybody is at a very short distance from somebody infected. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
	•	The small-world property is something intrinsic to networks. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
	•	Shortcuts are responsible for the small-world property in many other situations. The small-world property is something intrinsic to networks. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
	•	Whatever its origin, the small world property is crucial feature to be taken into account when the system have a structure of a graph. The network approache provides a striking vision of such systems: in the first place, their elements are aprt of one big world, where almost every node has a path of connections with every other; in the second place, these paths are extremely short. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
	•	
World risk society
	•	World risk society, however, is not characterised by global threats alone; a multiplicity of social and economic transnational links make world risk society a global society. Global threats play a predominant role in the creation of a global risk society: they undermine the credibility of political institutions charged with providing security, and they generate a global sense of common fate. Thus, they bring about a consciousness of cosmopolitan solidarity, which causes people to act transnationally in search of security. (Griner, 2002)
	•	The idea of a world risk society arises from a particular representation of humanity as threatened by absolute and inherently global risks. (Griner, 2002)
Subpoliticisation of world society
	•	This is what Beck calls ‘the subpoliticisation of world society’ where a global citizenship emerges and engages politically outside and beyond the political system of nation-states.5 Consequently, society is not just shaped from above—as it is through state action—but also from below by societal actors.6 ‘Threats create society and global threats create global society’.7 (Griner, 2002)
	•	World risk society does not imply a world state but rather the development of transnational cooperative procedures and institutions in which multiple overlapping power networks encompassing nations, companies, and NGOs would find a way to express their cosmopolitan consciousness. (Griner, 2002)
World trade web
	•	This world trade web is a network in which nodes are countries and their trade relations define the edges. Like the cell, economies depend on these multiple layers of networks. (Caldarelli and Catanzaro, 2012)
Work environment
	•	In the work environment the stakes are suddenly raised. People reveal qualities of their characters that they normally try to conceal. They manipulate, compete, and think of themselves first. We are blindsided by this behavior and our emotions are churned up even more than before, locking us into the Naïve Perspective. (Greene, 2014)
Workplace
	•	every workplace has its own conventions, rules of behavior, and work standards. (Greene, 2014)
Workshop
	•	Workshops represent a middle ground between public meetings and citizen advisory committees, involving citizens in a task-oriented process that enables more discussion than public meetings over less time than a citizen advisory committee. (Chess and Purcell, 1999)
Worldviews
	•	Worldviews are situation-invariant orienting mechanisms (i.e., a lens through which we view the world). (van der Linden, 2016)
Cultural worldview
	•	“cultural worldview” is not an innate psychological tendency that can be reliably inferred from individual-level data (Rippl, 2002). (van der Linden, 2016)


Worship
	•	People still tend to idealize leaders and worship them, and you must see this as a form of grandiosity. By believing someone else will make everything great, followers can feel something of this greatness. Their minds can soar along with the rhetoric of the leader. They can feel superior to those who are not believers. On a more personal level, people will often idealize those they love, elevating them to god or goddess status and by extension feeling some of this power reflected back on them. (Greene, 2018)
Y
Youth
	•	je souffre moins, parce qu'il y a en moi moins de force pour souffrir. A votre âge on a foi dans la vie, c'est le privilège de la jeunesse de croire et d'espérer ; mais les vieillards voient plus clairement la mort. (Dumas, 1998)
Z
Zeitgeist
	•	Zeitgest, the notion that there is a common spirit of the times discernible in everything we do. (Coker, 2009)
Zealot
	•	Zealots are not preoccupied with finding the truth because they are confident that they already know what it is. What they seek from intelligence is ammunition, not truth. There is no solution to this problem apart from ousting the zealots. (Betts, 2007)
